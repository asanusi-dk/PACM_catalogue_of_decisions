RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SUPERVISORY BODY ......................................... 14  3 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 1. Procedural background 1. The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the  Supervisory Body), at its fourteenth meeting (SBM 014), adopted the “Standard:  Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and  assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”1 (hereinafter referred to as  “Methodologies Standard”) and the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving  removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”2 (hereinafter referred to as “Removals  Standard”), and made specific recommendations to the Conference of the Parties serving  as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). Subsequently, the CMA  endorsed the approach by the Supervisory Body. 2. At its fifteenth meeting, the Supervisory Body approved the Workplan of the  Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) for 2025 which includes a request to prepare a  concept note on the applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and  vice versa. 3. At its sixth meeting, the MEP finalised a draft version of this concept note and launched a  call for public inputs which was open from 2 to 23 June 2025. In response to the call, 45  inputs were received. 2. Purpose 4. The purpose of this concept note is to address the mandate included in the 2025 workplan  of the MEP to prepare a concept note on the applicability of removal guidance to emission  reduction activities and vice versa. It aims to identify, for each section of each Standard,  whether its provisions should apply uniformly to all activity types or whether those  provisions should be applied with activity-specific considerations. 5. The MEP noted that many comments received on this concept note relate to the  requirements set out in the Removals Standard, “Standard: Setting the baseline in  mechanism methodologies”3, “Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism  methodologies”4 and the ongoing work by the MEP on matters related to non-  permanence/reversals. The MEP noted these comments and will consider them in its  future work. However, they cannot be addressed within the scope of this concept note,  which is limited to the purpose described in paragraph 4 above. 3. Key issues and proposed solutions 6. The Methodologies Standard generally applies to all Article 6.4 activities. The Removals  Standard generally applies to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks. However, there may be aspects of either Standard that may  not be feasible or appropriate to apply in all circumstances. 1 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf. 2 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf. 3 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-004.pdf 4 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-005.pdf  4 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 7. The MEP analysed the provisions in the Methodologies Standard and the Removals  Standard and identified that the applicability of specific provisions often does not depend  on whether the Article 6.4 activity involves emission reductions or net removals but rather  depends on the type of mitigation activity. This is illustrated through the following  examples:  (a) The provisions in the Removals Standard to address non-permanence should  apply to all mitigation activities that are subject to a risk of reversal, as reflected in  paragraph 89 of the Methodologies Standard and paragraph 10 of the Removals  Standard. This includes certain activity types that involve emission reductions and  all activity types that involve net removals;  (b) The provisions in the Methodologies Standard to address specific forms of leakage  do not apply to all mitigation activities. Some forms of leakage only occur in the  context of specific types of mitigation activities, irrespective of whether these  activities involve emission reductions or net removals;  (c) The provisions in the Removals Standard on monitoring and reporting are  generally suitable for emission reduction activities with reversal risks. However,  some monitoring approaches, such as use of remote sensing data, as referred to  in paragraph 26(g) of the Methodologies Standard and paragraph 11 of the  Removals Standard, are only suitable in certain sectors (e.g., forest-based  activities), irrespective of whether the activities result in emission reductions or net  removals. 8. The MEP therefore concluded that:  (a) The Methodologies Standard generally applies to activities involving removals.;  (b) The Removals Standard generally applies to emission reduction activities with  reversal risks. However, certain provisions only apply to certain types of mitigation  activities (see paragraphs 9 and 10 below). 9. In considering the applicability of the Removals Standard to emission reduction activities  with reversal risks, the MEP observed that four of the requirements of the Removals  Standard could be infeasible for certain activity types. Specifically, not all the provisions of  the following sections of the Removals Standard should be applicable to activity types that  cannot practically apply these requirements to the relevant greenhouse gas reservoir:  section 4.1 related to monitoring, section 4.2 related to reporting, section 4.3 related to  post-crediting period monitoring and reporting, and section 4.6 related to addressing  reversals. 10. Accordingly, the MEP proposes to exempt certain greenhouse gas reservoirs from aspects  of these elements of the Removals Standard, as discussed below for monitoring  (section 3.2.3 of this document), reporting (section 3.2.4 of this document), post-crediting  period monitoring and reporting (section 3.2.5 of this document), and addressing reversals  (section 3.2.8 of this document). These exemptions would apply only to those activities  where: (i) the greenhouse gas reservoirs are not under the control of the activity  participant, and (ii) the greenhouse gas reservoir is not in the same location as where the  5 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  mitigation activity is implemented, and (iii) changes observed in the greenhouse gas  reservoir could not be attributed to the mitigation activity.5 11. Apart from these exemptions, the other requirements of the Removals Standard would  apply in full. In all cases, the reversal risk assessment requirements in section 4.6.1 of the  Removals Standard would apply. This could facilitate alternative approaches to  addressing non-permanence, such as the use of discounting factors to account for future  reversal risks, informed by a consistent reversal risk assessment. 12. In the following, the MEP provides an analysis of all sections of the Methodologies  Standard and Removals Standard and provides a conclusion on whether the respective  sections should apply to activities involving removals and/or emission reduction activities  with reversal risks and, where relevant, to which type of mitigation activities the provisions  are applicable. Tables 1 and 2 below provide a summary overview of the findings of the  analysis.  Table 1.

Avoidance of other negative Yes  environmental and social  impacts and respecting  human rights and the rights  of Indigenous Peoples 3.1. Methodologies Standard 3.1.1. Encouraging ambition over time (section 4.1) 13. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition of  activities over time and should facilitate the deployment of low-carbon solutions and  technologies. The MEP notes that this section does not specifically refer to emission  reductions or net removals. However, the MEP is of the view that the provisions in this  section should apply to both activities involving removals and emission reduction activities.  Note that the activity-specific considerations related to encouraging ambition over time  may apply. The MEP notes that the baseline standard may be amended in the future to  incorporate further specific considerations for activities involving removals. 3.1.2. Being real, transparent, conservative, credible (section 4.2) 14. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to ensure  that all emission reductions or net removals are real, transparent, conservative and  credible. The MEP notes that this section refers to both emission reductions and net  removals. The MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both  activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.3. Establishing that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual (section 4.3) 15. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require  that the baseline selected shall be demonstrated as being below business as usual. The  MEP notes that paragraph 28 of this section refers to emission reduction activities. The  provisions in the “Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies” 7 apply to  mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions and net removals,  including ensuring that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual. The main  rationale is that the various possible reasons for setting baselines below business-as-  usual (ensuring conservativeness, providing incentives for implementing mitigation  technologies with lower emissions, ensuring that host Party countries can use part of the  mitigation outcomes to achieve their own NDC, etc.) equally apply to activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities. The MEP notes, however, that the baseline  standard may be amended in the future to incorporate further specific considerations for  activities involving removals. 7 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-004.pdf.  8 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 3.1.4. Contributing to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between participating  Parties (section 4.4) 16. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions for contributing  to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties, including the  application of conditions specified by the Designated National Authorities (DNAs) of the  host Party. The MEP notes that the provision described in paragraph 31(a) of this section  refers to emission reduction activities but does not exclude activities involving removals.  The MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals  and emission reduction activities. The main rationale is that the provisions required to  demonstrate equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties should  also support the sustainable development objectives of host Parties, whether the activities  involve emission reductions or net removals. 3.1.5. Aligning with the NDC of each participating Party, if applicable, its LT-LEDS, if it has  submitted one, the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the long-  term goals of the Paris Agreement (section 4.5) 17. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the  activity does not constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans  of the host Party with regard to the latest nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the  host Party, if applicable; its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development  strategies (LT-LEDS), if it has submitted one; and the long-term temperature goal of the  Paris Agreement and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. The MEP notes that this  section does not specifically refer to emission reductions or net removals. However, the  MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities. 3.1.6. Approaches to set the baseline (section 4.6) 18. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require  justification of the appropriateness of the choice of approach(es) for setting the baseline.  The MEP notes that this section does not specifically refer to activities involving removals  or emission reduction activities. The provisions in the “Standard: Setting the baseline in  mechanism methodologies” apply to mechanism methodologies related to both emission  reductions and net removals, including provisions regarding the selection of the approach  for setting the baseline. The main rationale is that it is important for both activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities that the baseline is suitable to the type of  mitigation activity. The MEP notes, however, that the baseline standard may be amended  in the future to incorporate further specific considerations for activities involving removals. 3.1.7. Addressing elements of paragraph 33 and paragraph 36 of the RMP (section 4.7) 19. This section describes provisions to address consistency of implementation of  paragraph 36 of the RMP with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP through the  application of appropriate approaches for downward adjustment of baselines. The MEP  notes that this section does not specifically refer to activities involving removals or  emission reduction activities. Paragraph 46 of the Methodologies Standard refers  specifically to negative emission technologies, which are understood to include activities  involving removals. The provisions in the “Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism  methodologies” apply to mechanism methodologies related to both activities involving  9 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  removals and emission reduction activities, including the provisions regarding  paragraph 33 and 36 of the RMP. This includes the provisions regarding the downward  adjustment. The MEP further notes that activity specific considerations may apply in  implementation of these provisions. The MEP further notes that the baseline standard may  be amended in the future to incorporate further specific considerations for activities  involving removals. 3.1.8. Encouraging broad participation (section 4.8) 20. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall encourage broad participation.  The MEP notes that this section refers to both emission reduction and removal activities.  The MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.9. Including data sources, accounting for uncertainty and monitoring requirements  (section 4.9) 21. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall include relevant assumptions,  data sources and key factors; account for uncertainty associated with emission factors,  activity data and other estimation parameters; and contain provisions requiring a listing of  data parameters that need to be monitored. The MEP notes that this section refers to  emission reductions or removals. The MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section  should apply to both activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.10. Recognizing suppressed demand (section 4.10) 22. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall recognize suppressed demand  in the context of an Article 6.4 activity, which is a situation where services provided to a  population are insufficient to meet the basic human needs such as minimum amount of  electricity for lighting, heating or cooling due to barriers, including low income or lack of  infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting such needs  requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline scenarios. The  MEP notes that this section does not refer to emission reductions or net removals. In  principle, this section is applicable to emission reductions and net removals. The MEP  notes, however, that suppressed demand is inherently linked to emissions growth from  increased energy use or other requirements to meet basic human needs. Net removals,  on the other hand, generally do not address unmet service needs related to energy  consumption or other requirements to meet basic human needs. Therefore, the provisions  for recognizing suppressed demand are primarily relevant to emission reduction activities.  However, the MEP notes the possibility that it may, in some instances, be relevant to  activities involving net removals. 3.1.11. Taking into account policies and measures and relevant circumstances  (section 4.11) 23. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to take into  account relevant circumstances, including national, regional, or local, social, economic,  environmental and technological, based on robust data and verifiable information. The  MEP notes that this section does not specifically refer to either emission reductions or net  removals or activities involving removals or emission reduction activities. However, the  10 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.12. Standardized baselines (section 4.12) 24. This section describes provisions for the development and application of standardized  baselines. The MEP notes that paragraph 63 of this section refers to calculation of the  GHG emission reductions or removals. The provisions in the “Standard: Setting the  baseline in mechanism methodologies” apply to mechanism methodologies related to both  activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. This includes the provisions  regarding standardized baselines. The MEP notes, however, that some specific provisions  in the section, such as the reference to facilities or equipment producing an output may  not be applicable to all types of mitigation activities. Moreover, the MEP notes that not all  types of standardized baselines will be applicable to all types of removals and emission  reduction activities and that the baseline standard may be amended in the future to  incorporate further considerations for activities involving removals. 3.1.13. Additionality demonstration (section 5) 25. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to  demonstrate the additionality of the activity. The MEP notes that this section does not  specifically refer to either emission reductions or net removals or to activities involving  removals or emission reduction activities. The MEP notes that the “Standard:  Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies”8 applies to mechanism  methodologies related to both activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities. 3.1.14. Leakage (section 6) 26. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall identify and avoid or, where  not possible, minimize potential sources of leakage. The MEP notes that this section does  not refer to either emission reductions or net removals. However, paragraph 64 of the  Removals Standard states that the activity participants shall address the risk of leakage  and account for any residual leakage in calculation of net removals in accordance with the  requirements set out in the Methodologies Standard. Therefore, the MEP is of the view  that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities. 3.1.15. Non-permanence and reversals (section 7) 27. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall address reversals, where  applicable. The MEP notes that this section requires mechanism methodologies to  address reversals of removals and emission reductions using an approach that is  consistent with the Removals Standard. The MEP is of the view that this section is a  general direction to employ a single, consistent approach to addressing non-permanence  and the risk of reversals, whether those activities involve removals or emission reductions,  or both. The MEP notes that the recent revision of the Activity Standard for Projects9,  which incorporated elements of the Removals Standard now refers to “Projects involving  removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks”. 8 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-003.pdf. 9 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf.  11 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 3.2. Removals Standard 3.2.1. Context (section 3.1) 28. This section refers to the relevant extracts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (WGIII) definitions of  removals, namely anthropogenic removals and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The MEP  notes that this section only describes removals but does not exclude emission reduction  activities. The MEP notes that in some instances these terms may also be used in the  context of methodologies for emission reduction activities. 3.2.2. Definitions (section 3.2) 29. This section states the definitions of removals, reversals and activities involving removals.  The MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals  and emission reduction activities with reversal risks. 3.2.3. Monitoring (section 4.1) 30. This section specifies monitoring requirements for removal activities and emission  reduction activities with reversal risks. The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals  Standard refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with  reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP is of the view that the  requirements in this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks, with the exception of those greenhouse  gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 10 of this document10 10. 3.2.4. Reporting (section 4.2) 31. This section specifies reporting requirements without being specific to either activities  involving removals or emission reduction activities with reversal risks. The MEP notes that  paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP  is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks, with the exception of those  greenhouse gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 10 of this  document. 3.2.5. Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting (section 4.3) 32. This section articulates activity participants’ obligation to monitor their activities to assess  whether any reversals have occurred in the post-crediting period (paragraph 26 of the  Removals Standard), specifies that activities shall not receive A6.4ERs for any net  removals that occur in the post-crediting period (paragraph 27 of the Removals Standard),  and provides conditions under which an activity participant may request permission from  the Supervisory Body to terminate their monitoring obligations in the post-crediting period  (paragraph 28 of the Removals Standard). The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the  Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism.  12 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 33. The MEP is of the view that the requirements in this section should apply to activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks as follows:  (a) For those greenhouse gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in  paragraph 10 of this document, only the provisions of paragraph 27 of the  Removals Standard should apply;  (b) For all other greenhouse gas reservoirs, all provisions in this section should apply. 3.2.6. Accounting for removals (section 4.4) 34. This section articulates how greenhouse gas accounting shall operate in the context of  calculating net removals. The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard  refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks  under the Article 6.4 mechanism. Therefore, the MEP is of the view that the requirements  of this section should apply to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks. 3.2.7. Methodologies applicable for a renewed crediting period (section 4.5) 35. This section specifies that, at the renewal of the crediting period, the activity participants  shall apply the latest version of the applicable methodology. The MEP notes that  paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP  is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities. 3.2.8. Addressing reversals (section 4.6) 36. This section articulates how activities involving removals shall conduct reversal risk  assessment (section 4.6.1 of the Removals Standard); notify the Supervisory Body of any  potential reversals and provide assessment of the consequences of any potential reversal  events (section 4.6.2 of the Removals Standard); and remediate reversals through the  operation of a buffer pool mechanism (section 4.6.3 of the Removals Standard). The MEP  notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals  and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 37. The MEP is of the view that the requirements in this section should apply to activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks as follows:  (a) For those greenhouse gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in  paragraph 10 of this document, only the provisions of section 4.6.1 of the Removals  Standard should apply;  (b) For all other greenhouse gas reservoirs, all provisions in this section should apply. 3.2.9. Avoidance of leakage (section 4.7) 38. This section specifies that activity participants shall address the risk of leakage and  account for any residual leakage in the calculation of net removals in accordance with the  requirements set out in the Methodologies Standard. The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of  the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas paragraph 64 of  section 4.7 in the Removals Standard makes explicit reference to the Methodologies  13 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  Standard. Therefore, the MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply  to both activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.2.10. Avoidance of other negative environmental and social impacts and respecting  human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples (section 4.8) 39. This section specifies that activity participants shall apply robust social and environmental  safeguards to minimize and, where possible, avoid negative environmental and social  impacts of the activity in accordance with the requirements referred to in this section. The  MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4  mechanism. Therefore, the MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both  activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 4. Impacts 40. This concept note provides further clarity on the applicability of different sections of the  Methodologies Standard and the Removals Standard. This will facilitate and inform the  further development of relevant standards (e.g., on addressing non-permanence) and the  development of mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. 5. Subsequent work and timelines 41. The MEP will consider and incorporate the analysis conducted in this concept note in the  development and further revision of relevant standards (e.g., on additionality, baselines,  addressing non-permanence, leakage, suppressed demand) and in assessing and  recommending mechanism methodologies and methodological tools for approval by the  Supervisory Body. 6. Recommendations to the Supervisory Body 42. The MEP recommends that the Supervisory Body considers and takes note of this concept  note.  -----  14 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  Document information  Version Date Description  02.0 14 July 2025 MEP 007, Annex 3.

Procedural background 1. The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism, at its tenth meeting, approved its  workplan for 2024 and requested the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) to prepare  recommendations on products related to addressing reversals. 2. In particular, the Supervisory Body requested the MEP to prepare recommendations on  the following products relating to the recommendation on removals:  (a) Guidance on post-crediting period monitoring, reporting, and remediation of  reversals, post-reversal action and host Party roles;  (b) Guidance on late, incomplete, or missing monitoring report submissions and  treatment of activities for which a reversal results in removals level that falls below  baseline;  (c) Reversal risk assessment tool;  (d) Guidance on avoidable and unavoidable reversals and reversal compensation. 3. At its first meeting, the MEP initiated its work on the above issues and agreed to  recommend that, due to the overlap and interdependencies between the four separate  elements listed in paragraph 2, as well as additional removal-related issues in the  “Recommendation: Activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” on  which the Supervisory Body requested input, the four elements mentioned above should  be incorporated into a single integrated standard on addressing non-permanence and  reversals. 4. The Supervisory Body, at its eleventh meeting, agreed with the recommendation of the  MEP to consolidate the four related issues and to develop a standard on addressing non-  permanence and reversals covering these issues.1 5. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Requirements  for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” (A6.4-STAN-METH-002,  hereinafter referred to as the “Removals Standard”)2 and made specific recommendations  to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA). At that meeting, the Supervisory Body also requested the MEP to  continue its work on the above issues on the basis of the adopted Removals Standard.  Subsequently, the CMA took note of the adoption of the document by the Supervisory  Body. 1 See document A6.4-SB011-A02: Workplan of the Methodological Expert Panel 2024. 2 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf.  2 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 6. At its fifteenth meeting, the Supervisory Body adopted the work plan for the MEP for 2025.  The workplan also includes the development of a “Tool: Reversal risk assessment”,  including:  (a) Whether upper limits are needed with respect of the risk rating (overall) or specific  risk factors (within the tool), including options and science-based rationales for  upper limit(s);  (b) Risk rating that constitutes a negligible risk;  (c) Any further categorization of risk; and  (d) How remediation measures are taken into account in the risk assessment tool. 7. At its seventh meeting, the MEP continued to work on the draft standard and released for  public consultation a draft standard, consisting of two alternative proposals. Specifically,  the MEP was divided as to whether it is necessary to address some requirements in a  standard directed to activity participants and some requirements in a standard directed to  mechanism methodologies or whether all requirements to address non-permanence and  reversals can be provided in a standard directed to activity participants. To reflect the  different views and options, the MEP elaborated three different Appendices for the  purpose of seeking public inputs, with one option consisting in Appendix one and Appendix  two and the other option consisting in Appendix three. 8. The call for public inputs opened for a three (3) week period from 15 July to 4 August 2025.  The MEP received 112 inputs, which are publicly available on the UNFCCC website3. The  secretariat prepared an internal compilation and synthesis of stakeholder inputs. 9. At its seventeenth meeting, the Supervisory Body noted the MEP’s ongoing work on  implementation of the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the  Article 6.4 mechanism” related to addressing non-permanence and reversals. The  Supervisory Body requested the MEP to prepare a single recommendation, identifying  options where necessary. The Supervisory Body underlined that, while the MEP is invited  to explore the full range of potential approaches to operationalize the requirements of the  Removals Standard for consideration of the Supervisory Body, it shall stay within the  mandate set by the previous decisions of the Supervisory Body including the Removals  Standard. In relation to the request for clarification concerning the role of the host Party in  the Removals Standard, the Supervisory Body acknowledged that there is no need for  specific focus on “host Party roles” and decided to remove the “host Party roles” from  Table 1 of the MEP workplan. 2. Purpose 10. The purpose of this document is to address the mandate provided by the Supervisory  Body to develop a standard on addressing non-permanence and reversals, while  considering the guidance provided by the Supervisory Body at its seventeenth meeting. 3 See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/stakeholder-  engagement/calls-for-input/2025-non-permanence-reversals  3 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 3. Key issues and proposed solutions 3.1. Summary of public comments addressed in the recommendation by the MEP 11. At its eighth meeting, the MEP continued to work on the draft reversals standard and  considered stakeholder inputs received during the public consultation. The MEP  considered the large number of inputs received, with appreciation for stakeholders’  engagement, and revised the draft standard accordingly. The following non-exhaustive list  of changes may be of particular interest to stakeholders:  (a) A new option for mechanism methodologies to apply a materiality threshold for  determining that a release of stored greenhouse gases is not a reversal. This  flexibility maintains environmental integrity and allows mechanism methodologies  to avoid situations where a small loss of greenhouse gas storage triggers a  notification and mandatory reporting requirements that are unnecessary due to the  natural recovery of greenhouse gas storage within a monitoring period. This  provision is implemented in paragraph 39 of Appendix 1;  (b) An update to the definition of a “negligible risk of reversal\". The draft standard  released for public consultation proposed a range of views that would establish the  definition as meaning a loss of no more than between 0.1 per cent and 5 per cent  of A6.4ERs over a 100-year period. This document includes a narrower range of  views, from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent over a 100-year period and recommends  that the Supervisory Body select a value from within this range. This provision is  implemented in paragraph 3(g) of Appendix 1;  (c) A refined approach to allow for alternative approaches to reversal-related  monitoring and reporting requirements under a limited set of conditions. These  alternative approaches apply where it is practically infeasible to account for  reversals in the way set out in the standard. The MEP also further clarified in the  text that alternative approaches may only be used where this ensures, with a high  level of confidence, that potential reversals from Article 6.4 activities are fully  remediated in the crediting period and post-crediting monitoring period and do not  cause instances of moral hazard. These provisions are implemented in section 5  of Appendix 1;  (d) An updated approach to determine the contribution to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. The draft standard released for public consultation did not clarify  that the reversal risk assessment tool would be applied exclusively to changes in  storage in greenhouse gas reservoirs, which is now clarified here. These  provisions are implemented in section 6.5 of Appendix 1;  (e) A single approach to implement the fraction of total A6.4ER issuance transferred  to the Adaptation Fund (to implement share of proceeds (SOP)) and the fund for  cancellation to support overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE). In the draft  standard released for public consultation, the MEP proposed two alternative  options (Option 1 and Option 2). The current document now implements one option  (formerly Option 1). These provisions are implemented in sections 6.6 and 6.7 of  Appendix 1; and  (f) More flexibility with regard to the timelines for submitting reversal-related reports.  In response to public comments, Appendix 2 includes longer grace periods until  4 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  reports are considered missing and provides a more flexible option to request for  the extension of submission deadlines, including an automatic 90-day extension in  cases of force majeure or the unavailability of a DOE. These provisions are  implemented in sections 2 and 2.1 of Appendix 2, and are summarized in Table 1  and Table 2 in Appendix 2. 12. In addition to the changes referenced in paragraph 11 above, the MEP also takes note of  the following matters:  (a) Applicability conditions. The MEP clarifies that the list of examples of activities to  which this draft standard would apply should not be interpreted to prejudice either  the approval of any applicable mechanism methodology or the eligibility of such  activities for registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism. They are listed only to  clarify whether this standard would apply to the activity type if the Supervisory Body  were to approve it for registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism. This provision  is implemented in section 3 of Appendix 1;  (b) Annual reversal reports. The MEP notes that many public comments addressed  the requirements of annual reversal reports and seeks to clarify that the annual  reversal reports would be simple forms that ensure ongoing communication  between Article 6.4 activities and the Supervisory Body. Annual reversal reports  would either list the notifications of potential reversal events already provided to  the secretariat during the previous calendar year, or a declaration that none  occurred. No additional reporting would be required, and to minimize the burden  on activity participants annual reversal reports could be verified as part of  subsequent monitoring reports. These provisions are implemented in section 1.3  of Appendix 2;  (c) Treatment of reversals below baselines. The MEP has elaborated a single  approach to addressing reversals below baselines. These provisions are  implemented in section 4.3 of Appendix 2;  (d) Provisions for activity de-registrations. The MEP has elaborated a single approach  to activity de-registration requirements. These provisions are implemented in  section 4.4 of Appendix 2; and  (e) Other changes. The MEP has made numerous other technical and editorial  changes in response to stakeholder input. These provisions are implemented  throughout the document and referenced elsewhere in the cover note where  notable. 13. The MEP also took note of the comments received on procedural matters, including  requests for additional calls for input, webinars, and other opportunities for stakeholder  engagement. 3.2. Summary of public comments not addressed in the recommendation by the MEP 14. The MEP notes that some comments were not addressed in the revision of the documents  and the recommendation by the MEP because they:  (a) Were found to be not aligned with the Removals Standard (see paragraph 15 of  this cover note);  5 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (b) Relate to other standards that have already been adopted by the Supervisory Body  (see paragraph 16 of this cover note); or  (c) Relate to ongoing and future work by the Supervisory Body and the MEP on other  regulatory documents (see paragraph 17 of this cover note). 15. A summary of comments not aligned with the Removals Standard includes, non-  exhaustively, the following:  (a) Use of the terms avoidable/unavoidable versus intentional/unintentional reversals.  Paragraphs 9(e) and 9(f) of the Removals Standard define reversals using the  terms avoidable and unavoidable reversals. Some comments supported the  adoption of the terms intentional and unintentional reversals;  (b) Use of the terms ‘acceptable risk of reversal’ instead of ‘negligible risk of reversal’.  Paragraph 28(a) of the Removals Standard uses the term ‘negligible risk of  reversal’. Some comments supported the adoption of the term ‘acceptable risk of  reversal’;  (c) Duration of post-crediting period monitoring and reporting. Paragraphs 26 and 28  of the Removals Standard do not provide a fixed period for post-crediting period  monitoring and reporting. Some comments suggested using a maximum fixed  period for post-crediting monitoring and reporting;  (d) Reversal-related reporting requirements. Section 4.6.2 of the Removals Standard  requires activity participants to report observed events that could lead to a reversal,  submit preliminary assessment reports that determine whether a reversal has  occurred, and submit a monitoring report to quantify the amount and classify the  type(s) of reversals that occur. Some comments suggested not to include  provisions requiring notification of observed events, preliminary assessment  reports, and/or monitoring reports. Some comments also raised concerns about  the overall burden of these reporting requirements; and  (e) Addressing reversals. Paragraph 38 and section 4.6.3.1 of the Removals Standard  require activity participants to conduct reversal risk assessments by using the  reversal risk assessment tool and contribute A6.4ERs to a Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. Some comments suggested the inclusion of alternative reversal risk  assessment mechanisms that would not require the use of the reversal risk  assessment tool or contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account.4 16. Some comments relate to other standards that have already been adopted by the  Supervisory Body. This includes, non-exhaustively, the following:  (a) Leakage standard: Some comments suggested that international leakage not be  considered or recommended alternative approaches to calculating leakage. 4 The MEP notes that some suggestions in this category may be aligned with the Removals Standard and  are part of ongoing MEP work, as referenced in paragraph 17(c) of this cover note and indicated in  section 3.2.1 of Appendix 2.  6 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 17. Some comments also referred to work that is ongoing or will be undertaken. This includes,  non-exhaustively, the following:  (a) Large-scale crediting programmes: Some comments flagged that the current  provisions are not applicable or practicable for large-scale crediting programmes.  The MEP notes that the proposed standard is only applicable to projects and that  the Supervisory Body has requested the MEP to work on a concept note on large-  scale crediting programmes. The MEP will consider these comments in preparing  the concept note;  (b) Reversal risk assessment tool: Some comments related to the estimation of  reversal risk using the reversal risk assessment tool and raised the concern about  their ability to comment on the treatment of reversal risks without publication of a  draft reversal risk assessment tool. The MEP notes that the Supervisory Body has  requested the MEP to expedite work on a reversal risk assessment tool and will  consider the comments in elaborating the tool; and  (c) Use of insurance programs, host Party guarantees, and other reversal-risk-related  management provisions. Some comments suggested the use of mechanisms for  addressing reversal risks that were not elaborated in the draft document and which  are consistent with the Removals Standard. The MEP notes that the Supervisory  Body has requested the MEP to work on a concept note addressing options for  implementing paragraph 62 of the Removals Standard, as indicated in paragraph  57(b) of this cover note. 3.3. Structure and scope of documents to address non-permanence and reversals 18. In its work on the mandates provided by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraphs 6 and 9  above, the MEP prepared a document that provides direction to mechanism  methodologies on how to implement the requirements of the Removals Standard. This  content is found in Appendix 1 to this document. 19. In its work on the mandates provided by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraphs 6 and 9,  the MEP agreed that for several issues, a single solution could be applicable to all types  of Article 6.4 activities that are subject to reversal risks. This content is found in Appendix 2  to this document. 20. The MEP did not achieve full consensus in respect to the progression of the Standard:  Addressing non-permanence and reversals. A member of the MEP requests that the  Supervisory Body consider concerns that the draft standard would preclude participation  by land-based activities due to the required consistency with the Removals Standard for  the reasons listed below and believes that amendments to the Removals Standard would  allow more equal participation opportunity to both technological and land-based activity  types without lessening the credibility of the outcome. There are four main areas where  concerns are held in this respect, including in particular:  (a) Requirement for standard monitoring reports to be used for reversals monitoring  and reporting, with specifications that could trigger frequent monitoring, reporting  and verification into the long-term, incurring substantial cost that would  disincentivise participation by the land sector;  (b) Requirement to undertake post-crediting monitoring and reporting on an indefinite  basis in the absence of achieving termination of post-crediting monitoring from  7 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  demonstration of negligible risk of reversal of stored GHGs or remediation  according to paragraph 28(b) of the Removals Standard;  (c) Requirement to include avoidable reversals within the risk rating calculation, which  would be difficult to undertake and would inappropriately elevate the risk rating for  land sector activities;  (d) Requirement of immediate registry suspensions under certain conditions related to  observed events, which would create considerable investment risk. 21. The other members of the MEP noted that the MEP was mandated to work within the  scope of the Removal Standard and was not requested to provide feedback on the  Removals Standard as part of this work. 22. The other members of the MEP further note that the draft standard responds to the  mandate from the Supervisory Body to implement the Removals Standard and observe  that the draft standard was improved by incorporating stakeholder input to provide  additional flexibility to Article 6.4 activities, including in the land sector. These elements  include:  (a) Simplified methods for monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring  period, including methods to establish that no reversals have occurred for the  purposes of monitoring (section 6.1 of Appendix 1);  (b) A recommendation that the Supervisory Body request the secretariat to develop a  simplified template for monitoring reports used in the post-crediting monitoring  period (paragraph 61 of the cover note);  (c) A materiality threshold to ensure that land-sector projects are not required to report  immaterial and temporary losses of greenhouse gas storage as potential or actual  reversals (paragraph 39 of Appendix 1); and  (d) The potential for additional options to terminate post-crediting period monitoring  and reporting obligations, as mandated by the Supervisory Body’s request to  develop a concept note on this topic (paragraph 57 of the cover note) and as  indicated in the draft standard that additional approaches consistent with  paragraph 62 of the Removals Standard may be developed in the future  (section 3.2.1 of Appendix 2). 3.4. Appendix 1 (direction for mechanism methodologies) 3.4.1. Negligible risk of reversal 23. Paragraph 28 of the Removals Standard provides that activity participants may request to  terminate their obligations to conduct post-crediting period monitoring if they can  demonstrate that their storage of greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse gases  is at a negligible risk of reversal. In paragraph 3(g) of Appendix 1, the MEP agreed to  define negligible risk of reversal as a maximum percentage loss of the emission reductions  and/or net removals for which A6.4ERs have been issued, as calculated over 100 years  starting from no earlier than the end of the last active crediting period for an activity. The  MEP notes that, in further work on the reversal risk assessment tool, additional work may  be needed to address considerations related to the likelihood of reversal, the magnitude  8 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  of potential reversals, and the interactions between likelihood of reversal and magnitude  of potential reversals. 24. The MEP noted that the percentage chosen is a normative policy decision. The MEP  recommends the Supervisory Body choose a value within the range between 0.5 to  2.5 percent. The MEP further notes that a relatively lower percentage provides a relatively  higher confidence that no reversals may occur but may make it also more difficult to  terminate monitoring through the demonstration of negligible risk. The MEP further notes  that the percentage chosen has implications on the remaining risk that the buffer pool  needs to cover, with relatively larger percentages causing the buffer pool to bear a  relatively larger risk. 25. To assist the Supervisory Body in its decision-making process, the MEP notes related  definitions taken by other relevant actors in other circumstances. The MEP further notes  that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines the term “virtually certain” as  indicating at least a 99 per cent probability in the context of describing the degree of  certainty in findings of the IPCC assessment process, analogous to a choice of no more  than 1 percent.5 3.4.2. Identification of applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs 26. Section 5 of Appendix 1 provides a procedure for how mechanism methodologies shall  identify relevant greenhouse gas reservoirs for the purposes of applying the mechanism’s  reversal risk assessment tool and allowing for alternative approaches to reversal-related  monitoring and reporting requirements under a limited set of conditions. 27. The MEP considered the concerns expressed by the Supervisory Body with respect to the  exemptions proposed in the “Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission  reduction activities and vice versa” and implemented a refined approach of the proposal  in Appendix 1. The MEP retained the three criteria included in the concept note in which  a simplified approach may be used but added footnotes to further clarify the approach,  including a specific example. The MEP also noted that the three conditions must be fulfilled  in conjunction which means that they only apply to a limited set of situations. Furthermore,  the proponents of mechanism methodologies shall appropriately justify that the conditions  apply, which shall be assessed by the MEP and the Supervisory Body. This ensures that  the provisions cannot be interpreted in ways that were unintended. 28. The MEP further notes that in circumstances where these conditions apply it is practically  infeasible to account for reversals in the way set out in the standard. This raises the  concern that certain types of activities, such as efficient cookstove projects, would  otherwise not qualify to register under the mechanism. The MEP also further clarified in  the text that alternative approaches may only be used where this ensures, with a high level  of confidence, that potential reversals from Article 6.4 activities are fully remediated in the  crediting period and post-crediting monitoring period and do not cause instances of moral  hazard. The MEP also clarified that the reversal risk assessment tool shall be applied by  all activities subject to reversal risks. 5 IPCC (2010) Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on the Consistent  Treatment of Uncertainties:  https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/uncertainty-guidance-note.pdf.  The MEP notes that these definitions are still in active use by the IPCC.  9 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 3.4.3. Quantification of emission reductions and/or net removals and reversals 29. Section 6 of Appendix 1 provides a procedure for how to quantify an Article 6.4 activity’s  emission reductions and/or net removals as well as how to quantify any reversals that may  occur. Paragraph 9 of the Removals Standard defines a reversal in relation to section 4.4  of the Removals Standard (“Accounting for removals”). Accordingly, the MEP  implemented a set of equations operationalizing section 4.4 of the Removals Standard to  address the following components:  (a) Net change in storage of a greenhouse gas or precursors of greenhouse gases:  Equation 1 specifies how to calculate the net change in storage during the activity’s  active crediting period, which is calculated in relation to an activity’s baseline  scenario. Equation 2 specifies how to calculate the net change in storage in the  post-crediting monitoring period, which, as a default matter, is not calculated in  relation to an activity’s baseline scenario. Together, both equations provide a  formal definition of what a reversal is and how to quantify the amount of a reversal;  (b) Net change in greenhouse gas emissions: Equation 3 specifies how to calculate  the net change in emissions in the Article 6.4 activity scenario, in the Article 6.4  activity’s baseline scenario, and due to leakage;  (c) Total A6.4ERs issuance: Equation 4 specifies how to calculate the total number of  A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to an Article 6.4 activity’s emission reductions  and/or net removals, drawing on the earlier equations and accounting for any  crediting deficit as discussed below;  (d) Crediting deficit: Because the net change in storage and net change in emissions  can lead to a calculation of negative A6.4ER issuance, it is necessary to track any  such crediting deficits and include them in the calculation of future credit issuance.  Equations 5, 6, and 7 specify how to calculate and update the crediting deficit;  (e) A6.4ER contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account: Equation  8 specifies how to calculate the number of total A6.4ERs that would be contributed  to the buffer pool, based on the application of the reversal risk assessment tool;  (f) A6.4ER contributions to the Adaptation Fund and contributions to overall mitigation  in global emissions: Equations 9 and 10 specify how to calculate the faction of total  A6.4ERs that would be contributed to the Adaptation Fund (to implement the share  of proceeds requirement, or SOP) and to the account for cancellation towards  delivering overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE), respectively;  (g) A6.4ER issuance to activity participants: Equation 11 specifies how to calculate  the number of A6.4ERs issued to activity participants, net of the contribution to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, the Adaptation Fund (SOP), and the account  for cancelation toward delivering OMGE. 30. In elaborating the provisions identified in paragraph 29(f) above, the MEP included in  Appendix 1 to its draft standard finalized for public comments at its seventh meeting two  alternative options to calculate the fraction of A6.4ERs to be contributed to the Adaptation  Fund (SOP) and OMGE. Alternative option 1 calculated the share of A6.4ERs contributed  to the Adaptation Fund and OMGE using the total number of issued A6.4ERs as the  denominator, whereas alternative option 2 calculated the share using a subset of the total  number of issued A6.4ERs, net of the buffer pool contribution, as the denominator.  10 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 31. The MEP further analysed these options and sought legal advice on this matter from the  secretariat. The MEP noted that the provisions in the CMA decisions and the Removals  Standard do not address the forwarding of A6.4ERs from the pending account to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. The MEP further noted that paragraph 58 and 67 of  the RMPs (decision 3/CMA.3) refer to the contribution for the Adaptation Fund to be  applied “at issuance”. Additional provisions set out in the transaction procedure in  paragraph 37 of the Annex I to decision 7/CMA.4 specify that first all A6.4ERs are issued  into a pending account. Subsequently, five percent of “issued A6.4ERs” are forwarded or  first transferred to the Adaptation Fund (paragraph 39), two percent of “issued A6.4ERs”  are cancelled to deliver OMGE (paragraph 40), and the “remaining” A6.4ERs are  forwarded or first transferred to holding accounts of activity participants or Parties involved  (paragraph 41). Based on these considerations, it appears that the share of SOP and  OMGE should be determined based on the total number of A6.4ERs issued into the  pending account, which corresponds to the Alternative Option 1 included in the document  prepared at MEP 007. This is consistent with the legal advice by the secretariat. Based on  this analysis, the MEP implemented this option in Appendix 1. In its further work on the  reversal risk assessment tool, the MEP will consider any implications for determining  contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. 32. In elaborating the provisions identified in paragraph 31 above, the MEP also noted that  neither the relevant Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 decisions by the CMA6 nor the Removals  Standard explicitly address the question of whether a contribution to the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account is a forwarding or a first transfer of A6.4ERs. In the draft standard,  the MEP included an approach that is consistent with the approach for SOP and OMGE  in decision 4/CMA.4, i.e. that mitigation contribution A6.4ERs are to be forwarded to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account without effecting a first transfer and that the forwarding  of authorised A6.4ERs is to be effected as a first transfer. The MEP requests the  Supervisory Body to confirm that this approach is appropriate. 33. In elaborating the provisions identified in paragraphs 29(e) and 29(f), the MEP also noted  that the requirements for quantifying the contribution of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, the Adaptation Fund, and the account for cancellation towards  delivering OMGE could be implemented in one or more higher-level regulatory documents,  such as the standard “Article 6.4 activity standard for projects” (A6.4-STAN-AC-002),7 the  procedure “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002),8 and/or  the procedure “Article 6.4 mechanism registry” (A6.4-PROC-REGS-001).9 3.4.4. Identification and quantification of reversals 34. Section 7 of Appendix 1 provides a procedure for how to identify reversals, quantify  reversals, and classify reversals as avoidable or unavoidable. It also provides direction to  mechanism methodologies to specify the data and methods that activity participants  should use to prepare monitoring reports and to conduct monitoring and reporting in the  post-crediting monitoring period. 6 See Decisions 2/CMA.3, 3/CMA.3, 6/CMA.4, 7/CMA.4, 4/CMA.6, 5/CMA.6 and 6/CMA.6. 7 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002-v01.0.pdf. 8 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-AC-002.pdf. 9 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-REGS-001.pdf.  11 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 35. Paragraph 39 of Appendix 1 also provides the option for mechanism methodologies to  determine a materiality threshold that applies to observed events involving the release of  stored greenhouse gases. This provision allows mechanism methodologies to  conservatively quantify the removals expected within a monitoring period on an ex-ante  basis. If an observed event leads to a release of greenhouse gases that is smaller than  this threshold, then the observed event is deemed not to constitute a reversal and the  activity participant does not need to notify the secretariat of the observed event or prepare  a preliminary assessment report. The MEP notes that these provisions only apply,  however, to activity types that generate ongoing net removals without ongoing  interventions by the activity participant. 3.5. Appendix 2 (direction for activity participants) 3.5.1. Reversal-related notifications and reports  Table 1. Summary of reversal-related reporting requirements  Timing of Whether verification is  Requirement Purpose  submission required  Notification Inform the Within 30 days of the No  Supervisory Body end of an observed  of a potential event  reversal  Preliminary Determine whether Within 90 days of the Yes, but only if the  assessment report a reversal has end of an observed preliminary assessment  occurred event report concludes that a  reversal has not occurred  Monitoring report Quantify amount Within 365 days of Yes  and classify the the end of an  type of reversal observed event  Annual reversal Ensure regular Annually, due 31 Yes, and verification can  report communication with March each year be done ex post as part of  activity participants the verification of a  monitoring report 36. Section 1.2 of Appendix 2 provides a procedure on how to identify potential reversal  events and prepare a preliminary assessment report to determine whether a reversal has  occurred. If a preliminary assessment report indicates that a reversal has occurred, a  monitoring report is required to determine the amount and type of the reversal. 37. Consistent with section 4.6.2 of the Removals Standard, section 1.2 of Appendix 2  provides for the temporary suspension of an affected activity’s registry account  functionality when a potential reversal event is detected and the restoration of that registry  account functionality once an activity participant either:  (a) Confirms that no reversal has occurred through a verified preliminary assessment  report; or  (b) Remediates any actual reversals per the provisions of section 4 of Appendix 2. 38. Because monitoring reports could be relatively infrequent for some activity types,  section 1.3 of Appendix 2 also requires activity participants to prepare annual reversal  12 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  reports. In cases where no reversals or potential reversal events occurred in the calendar-  year period covered by an annual reversal report, an annual reversal report may simply  state this conclusion. In cases where a reversal or potential reversal event occurred, the  reversal report will list the relevant events and notifications. No other information is  required. 39. The MEP notes that the purpose of the annual reversal report is to require a regular form  of communication with Article 6.4 activities. To reduce the burden on activity participants,  the annual reversal report(s) may be included within the next monitoring report for  verification. 40. The MEP also noted that the volume of information that must be included in monitoring  reports during the post-crediting monitoring period is significantly more limited than is  required during the crediting period. In this regard, the MEP recommends that the  secretariat develops a separate template for monitoring reports for the post-crediting  monitoring period that is simpler than the form for monitoring reports for the crediting  periods (A6.4-FORM-AC-021). 3.5.2. Late, incomplete or missing report submissions 41. Section 2 of Appendix 2 defines late and missing preliminary assessment report  submissions, annual reversal reports, and monitoring reports, along with a procedure for  how the secretariat will review submissions for completeness. Section 2 of Appendix 2  also provides for a series of escalating consequences that shall apply in cases of late and  missing monitoring reports. 42. Late reports trigger the temporary suspension of an activity participant’s registry account  functionality, which can be restored by the submission of the required reports before the  reports are classified as missing. Because a preliminary assessment report is required  whenever there is an observed event that could potentially lead to a reversal, and that  observed event separately triggers the same temporary suspension of an activity  participants’ registry account functionality, no additional consequence is imposed for late  preliminary assessment reports. 43. The consequences for missing reports are as follows. In the event of a missing preliminary  assessment report, the activity participant is required to prepare a full monitoring report.  In the event of a missing annual reversal report or a missing monitoring report, the Article  6.4 activity will be deemed to have experienced avoidable reversals equivalent to the total  number of A6.4ERs issued with respect to the activity’s emission reductions and/or net  removals and the activity participant is obligated to remediate this reversal according to  the provisions of section 4.2 of Appendix 2. 3.5.3. Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting 44. Section 3 of Appendix 2 describes activity participants’ obligations to conduct post-  crediting period monitoring of greenhouse gas reservoirs and reporting related to any  potential or actual reversals. 45. Consistent with section 4.3 of the Removals Standard, the obligation to monitor and report  in the post-crediting period is ongoing until activity participants can demonstrate either that  the stored greenhouse gases or their precursors have a negligible risk of reversal or that  the potential future reversal of this storage has been remediated. As a result, the time  13 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  period for post-crediting period monitoring and reporting may be indefinite. Some MEP  members are of the view that the post-crediting period monitoring could be limited in time.  However, the MEP notes that the Removals Standard does not provide for a definite limit  for the maximum duration of monitoring and therefore this option was not included. 46. Section 3 of Appendix 2 also provides a procedure for when and how activity participants  may request the Supervisory Body to terminate their post-crediting period monitoring and  reporting obligations. 47. As elaborated in Section 3.2.1 of Appendix 2, activity participants may cancel A6.4ERs,  with the number of A6.4ERs cancelled equal to the total number of A6.4ERs issued with  respect to the activity’s emission reductions and/or net removals. Cancellation of  authorized A6.4ERs is required for any authorized A6.4ERs issued with respect to the  activity’s emission reductions and/or net removals. Activity participants are eligible to  undertake these provisions at any point in the post-crediting monitoring period. 48. As elaborated in Section 3.2.2 of Appendix 2, activity participants may demonstrate that  their stored greenhouse gases or greenhouse gas precursors are subject to a negligible  risk of reversal, using methods identified by mechanism methodologies consistent with  section 7.4 of Appendix 1. Activity participants are eligible to undertake these provisions  only after a minimum period of time has elapsed in the post-crediting monitoring period,  as defined by mechanism methodologies consistent with section 7.4 of Appendix 1. 3.5.4. Post-reversal actions 49. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Appendix 2 provides a procedure for how unavoidable and  avoidable reversals shall be remediated. Unavoidable reversals are remediated by  cancelling A6.4ERs in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, with the number cancelled  equal to the amount of the unavoidable reversals expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide  equivalent. Avoidable reversals are remediated in the same manner, with the additional  requirement that activity participants shall replenish the buffer pool with an equal number  of A6.4ERs. For both avoidable and unavailable reversals, remediation requires the  cancellation of authorized A6.4ERs for reversals involving authorized A6.4ERs. 3.5.5. Reversals below baselines 50. Section 4.3 of Appendix 2 addresses the situation in which a reversal reduces greenhouse  gas storage below baseline levels (a “reversal below baseline”). It clarifies that the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account only remediates greenhouse gas storage losses for  which A6.4ERs have been issued. 51. Section 4.3 of Appendix 2 further clarifies that A6.4ERs will not be issued to Article 6.4  activities for any enhancements to greenhouse gas storage that are below baseline levels.  Article 6.4 activities that experience a reversal below baseline levels may continue to  enhance greenhouse gas storage and return to baseline levels, and A6.4ERs will be  issued for greenhouse gas storage enhancements above baseline level as usual. 3.5.6. De-registration of activities 52. Section 4.4 of Appendix 2 provides a procedure for how Article 6.4 activities subject to risk  of reversals can de-register. De-registration requires the cancellation of A6.4ERs, with the  number of A6.4ERs cancelled equal to the total number of A6.4ERs issued with respect  to the Article 6.4 activity’s emission reductions and/or net removals.  14 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 53. When an activity de-registers, the secretariat shall cancel A6.4ERs in the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, with the number of A6.4ERs cancelled equal to the total A6.4ER  contributions made to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account with respect to the Article  6.4 activity. The activity participant shall make the rest of the necessary cancellations. 3.5.7. Insurance coverage for reversals 54. The MEP notes that paragraph 59 of the Removals Standard provides that activity  participants should obtain and maintain sufficient coverage under an insurance policy or  comparable guarantee products to cover the risk that avoidable reversals occur. The MEP  was unable to identify any comparable types of insurance products. Accordingly, the MEP  has not included a requirement that activity participants obtain insurance or other  comparable guarantee products to cover activity participants’ avoidable reversal risks. 55. The MEP further proposes to address separate, insurance-related issues in the context of  remediating potential future reversals in the concept note requested from the Supervisory  Body pursuant to paragraph 57(b) below. 4. Impacts 56. The proposed recommendation will provide further clarity on the requirements with regard  to addressing non-permanence and reversals. 5. Subsequent work and timelines 57. The MEP will continue working on some elements of the mandates provided by the  Supervisory Body, including:  (a) A reversal risk assessment tool that addresses:  (i) Whether upper limits are needed in respect of the overall risk rating or  specific risk factors are to be included within the tool, including options and  science-based rationales for upper limit(s);  (ii) Risk rating that constitutes a negligible risk;  (iii) Any further categorization of risk; and  (iv) How remediation measures are taken into account in the risk assessment  tool.  (b) A concept note on options for the implementation of paragraph 62 of the “Standard:  Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. 58. The MEP notes that the proposed standard is only applicable to projects and not to large-  scale crediting programmes. The MEP further notes that several public comments raised  that provisions in the current standard are not applicable or practical for large-scale  crediting programmes, such as jurisdictional approaches for reducing emissions from  deforestation. After finalising a concept note on large-scale crediting programmes, this  standard could be amended in the future to address large-scale crediting programmes. 59. The MEP notes that many public comments referred to the challenge for private sector  entities to assume responsibility for monitoring and compensating for long or undefined  periods in the case of project-level activities. In this respect, the MEP notes that this  15 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  standard does not yet incorporate any possible alternative approaches for addressing  reversals in the post-crediting monitoring period that will be explored within the mandate  provided to develop a concept note by the Supervisory Body referred to in paragraph 57(b)  of this cover note. The MEP further notes that the standard could be amended, following  the finalisation of the concept note, to incorporate such approaches. 60. Similarly, the MEP notes that many public comments referred to the role of host Parties in  addressing reversals, such as in assuming long term liability and the linkage between  reversals under the Article 6.4 mechanism and reporting requirements under the Paris  Agreement. Because the Supervisory Body has clarified that the potential role of host  Parties is not within the MEP’s mandate for the current agenda item, the draft standard  does not address host Party roles. However, the MEP further notes that the standard could  be amended to address host Party roles following the preparation of the concept note  referred to in paragraph 57(b) of this cover note. 6. Recommendations to the Supervisory Body 61. The MEP recommends the Supervisory Body to:  (a) Consider the range of values proposed for defining a negligible risk of reversal,  specify a single value to be adopted for the definition of a negligible risk of reversal,  and adopt the draft standard “Addressing non-permanence and reversals in  mechanism methodologies” included in Appendix 1;  (b) Agree on the “Elements for inclusion in relevant regulatory documents” included in  Appendix 2 and request the secretariat, in consultation with the MEP, to  incorporate these elements into a draft revision of the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity  standard for projects” (A6.4-STAN-AC-002), the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity  cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002), the “Procedure: Article 6.4  mechanism registry” (A6.4-PROC-REGS-001), and the “Standard: validation and  verification standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-003)” for consideration by the  Supervisory Body at a future meeting;  (c) Request the secretariat to review and update, in consultation with the MEP, all  cross-references made between Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 to reflect the  approved “Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals in mechanism  methodologies” and to reflect the appropriate elements of the revised Standards  and Procedures referenced in paragraph 61(b);  (d) Confirm that the approach implemented in section 6.6 and 6.7 of the draft standard  is appropriate that mitigation contribution A6.4ERs are to be forwarded to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account without effecting a first transfer and that the  forwarding of authorised A6.4ERs is to be effected as a first transfer, consistent  with the approach for OMGE and SOP; and  (e) Request the secretariat to develop a simplified template for monitoring reports for  the post-crediting monitoring period.  16 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 TABLE OF CONTENTS Page APPENDIX 1.

Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence  and reversals in mechanism methodologies 1. Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This standard sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies to address non-  permanence and reversals. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies  in developing methodologies and by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Methodological Expert  Panel (MEP) and the Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism  methodologies for approval. 1.2. Entry into force 2. This document enters into force on # date #. 2. Definitions 3. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Active crediting period: The first crediting period of an Article 6.4 activity and any  subsequent crediting period that has been renewed;  (b)  DRAFT  Avoidable reversals: Reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have influence or control;  (c) Carbon stock: The quantity of carbon in a greenhouse gas reservoir;  (d) Crediting deficit: A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an  Article 6.4 activity caused by factors other than reversals1  (e) Greenhouse gas reservoir: A component or components of the global climate  system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored. For  the purposes of the Article 6.4 mechanism, this term excludes the atmosphere and  includes the biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere;  (f) Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent  agreements, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding  mandates, noting that regulatory environments may vary;  (g) Negligible risk of reversal: A risk of reversal that would result in a loss of no more  than [X] 2 percent of all the A6.4ERs issued with respect to the total emission  reductions and/or net removals achieved by the activity during its active crediting  period,3 calculated over a 100-year timeframe starting from no earlier than the end  of the last active crediting period;  (h) Observed event: An indication of any occurrence involving the release of stored  greenhouse gases that could potentially lead to a reversal; 1 See section 6.4 of this Appendix. 2 See section 3.4.1 of the cover note. The MEP recommends the SBM adopt a value within the range  between 0.5 to 2.5 percent. 3 Consistent with section 6.3 of this Appendix.  18 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (i) Post-crediting monitoring period: The period that follows the last active crediting  period, during which time activity participants monitor greenhouse gas reservoirs  for reversals and no A6.4ERs shall be generated;  (j) Reversal: A net loss in the storage of a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas for which A6.4ERs have been issued, calculated across all  applicable greenhouse gas reservoir(s) over a period of time covered by a  monitoring report;  (k) Reversal risk assessment tool: A methodological tool that is used to determine  the fraction of the total number of A6.4ERs to be contributed to the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account and whether an activity faces a negligible risk of reversal;  (l) Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account: A registry account, administered by the  secretariat in its role as administrator of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry, from  which A6.4ERs are cancelled to remediate reversals;  (m) Unavoidable reversals: Reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have no influence or control. 3. Applicability 4. This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for  activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to  also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes  of activities, policies, sectoral approaches). 5.  DRAFT  None of the types of activities or examples mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 7 is intended  to prejudice whether an activity or example is or should be eligible for registration under  the Article 6.4 mechanism. They are listed only to clarify whether this standard would apply  to the activity type if the Supervisory Body were to approve it for registration under the  Article 6.4 mechanism. 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies for activities involving emission  reductions with reversal risks and activities involving removals with reversal risks. This  includes, but is not limited to, the following types of activities:  (a) Activities increasing carbon stocks or reducing the loss of carbon stocks, relative  to the baseline, in any of the greenhouse gas reservoirs of the biosphere;4  (b) Activities increasing the storage of greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse  gases, relative to the baseline, in products or materials;5  (c) Activities increasing the storage of greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse  gases, relative to the baseline, in geological reservoirs;6 4 This includes, for example, afforestation, reduced deforestation, peatland rewetting, agricultural  practices to enhance soil organic carbon, activities reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass. 5 This includes, for example, capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its storage in construction  materials, such as concrete, or the storage of carbon in biochar or in harvested wood products. 6 This includes, for example, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in a geological  reservoir or capturing greenhouse gases from point sources (e.g., cement production plants, biomass  combustion) and storing them in a geological reservoir.  19 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (d) Activities accelerating, relative to the baseline, natural processes by which  minerals react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and lock it away as  carbonates;7  (e) Activities increasing, relative to the baseline, the capacity of the hydrosphere to  store greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse gases;8  (f) Activities preventing the release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels that in their  natural deposits or during storage after extraction would, in the baseline scenario,  interact with the atmosphere.9 7. The following types of activities are deemed not to be subject to reversal risks:  (a) Activities reducing the combustion of fossil fuels that, in their natural deposits or  during storage after extraction, do not interact with the atmosphere;10  (b) Activities reducing greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide through processes  not related to storage in a greenhouse gas reservoir.11 4. General principles and requirements 4.1. Principles 8. The following principles shall be applied in the context of addressing reversals to ensure  that information provided is a true and fair account. These principles shall be the basis for  and guide the development of mechanism methodologies:  (a)  DRAFT  Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for addressing  reversals shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters that may  have an impact on how reversals are addressed shall be included;  (b) Completeness: All relevant information to address reversals shall be provided;  (c) Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across  similar circumstances;  (d) Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative  information shall be reduced as far as it is practical;  (e) Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow  intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency  relates to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied;  referencing background material; stating documentation changes; and stating and  justifying all data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the  outcomes can be reproduced. 7 This includes, for example, enhanced weathering. 8 This includes, for example, storing carbon dioxide in the water column of oceans or enhancing the  alkalinity of oceans. 9 This includes, for example, closing abandoned oil wells, extinguishing coal mine fires, or preventing fires  from gas and oil wells. 10 This includes, for example, renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, and fossil  fuel switching. 11 This includes, for example, landfill gas capture and utilisation, abatement of nitrous oxide emissions from  nitric acid production, reduction of N 2O emissions from fertilizer application, or reduction of methane  emissions from rice cultivation or enteric fermentation.  20 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 4.2. General requirements 9. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure conservativeness in addressing reversals. This  shall apply to all data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used in the analysis  (e.g., assumptions made in the risk assessment). The degree of conservativeness shall  be based on the overall level of uncertainty. All sources of uncertainty shall be considered,  including uncertainty in data, parameters, assumptions, and methods. 10. Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the provisions in mechanism  methodologies to address reversals consider all national or sub-national policies, including  legal requirements, that are applicable to the relevant Article 6.4 activity. 5. Identification of applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs 11. Mechanism methodologies shall identify all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs:  (a) That may be affected by Article 6.4 activities covered by that methodology; and  (b) For which changes in the storage of a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas are eligible for the issuance of A6.4ERs. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to apply the reversal risk  assessment tool to the greenhouse gas reservoirs identified in paragraph 11 to determine  the fraction of the total number of A6.4ERs to be contributed to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. 13. The proponents of a mechanism methodology may propose alternative approaches to the  DRAFT  provisions listed in paragraph 15 if these alternative approaches ensure, with a high level  of confidence, that reversals from Article 6.4 activities are fully remediated in the crediting  period and post-crediting monitoring period and ensure that the alternative approaches do  not cause instances of moral hazard.12 These approaches may only be proposed if all of  the following conditions are satisfied for the applicable greenhouse gas reservoir:  (a) That activity participants using the mechanism methodology have no control over  the greenhouse gas reservoir;13  (b) That the greenhouse gas reservoir is not in the same location as where the  mitigation activity is implemented; and  (c) That changes observed in the greenhouse gas reservoir cannot be attributed to  the mitigation activity.14 12 Moral hazard issues do not arise because proponents of mechanism methodologies may propose  alternative approaches only where activity participants have no direction or influence over the relevant  greenhouse gas reservoirs, which is required to satisfy paragraph 13(a). In contrast, moral hazard issues  would be present if activity participants have direction or influence over the relevant greenhouse gas  reservoirs. In that case, however, proponents of mechanism methodologies would not be allowed to  propose alternative approaches because they would fail the requirements of paragraph 13(a). 13 In this context, control means that the activity participants have direction and influence on the  greenhouse gas reservoir through financial, policy, management or other instruments. 14 This could apply, for example, to a cookstove efficiency project that reduces demand for non-renewable  biomass, and that biomass is collected by individuals from forests on publicly held lands located a few  kilometres from their residences. Neither the cookstove project owner nor the participating households  have control over the forests from which biomass is sourced. The public entity could implement forest  management practices that enhance biomass stocks, unrelated to the impacts of the project; similarly,  the public entity could implement harvesting that would reduce biomass stocks, once again affecting the  reservoir but unrelated to the impacts of the project.  21 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 14. When a proponent of a mechanism methodology proposes alternative approaches for any  of the provisions listed in paragraph 15, they shall provide appropriate justification for why  the conditions set out in paragraph 13 apply to each relevant greenhouse gas reservoir. 15. Proponents of mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches to any of  the following provisions, so long as those alternative approaches meet the conditions of  paragraphs 13 and 14:  (a) General requirements for the identification and quantification of reversals (section  7.1 of this document);  (b) Frequency of submitting monitoring reports (section 7.2 of this document);  (c) Monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting period (section 7.4 of this document);  (d) Reversal-related notifications and reports (section 1 of Appendix 2);  (e) Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting (section 3 of Appendix 2); and  (f) Post-reversal actions (section 4 of Appendix 2). 16. None of the alternative approaches proposed per paragraph 15 shall limit or exempt Article  6.4 activities from following any other requirements, including, without limitation:  (a) The “Tool: Reversal risk assessment”;15  (b) The “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool” (A6.4-TOOL-AC-001);16 and 17.  (c)  DRAFT  Any monitoring and reporting obligations unrelated to the management of non-  permanence and reversals.  A summary of the provisions that are eligible for alternative approaches and their  relationship to the Removals Standard and the “Concept note: Applicability of removal  guidance to emission reductions and vice versa” (A6.4-MEP007-A03)17 is shown in Table .

Quantification of emission reductions and/or net removals and reversals 18. Mechanism methodologies shall quantify emission reductions and/or net removals, and  any reversals, consistent with the equations set out in this section as follows:  (a) Mechanism methodologies shall apply all subsections of this section for use during  an Article 6.4 activity’s crediting period; and  (b) Mechanism methodologies shall apply section 6.1 for use during an Article 6.4  activity’s post-crediting monitoring period. 6.1. Net change in storage of a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas 19. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine, for use during the  Article 6.4 activity’s crediting period, the net change in storage resulting from the Article  6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, consistent with the  following equation:18  ∆𝑆𝑡 = ∑ [(𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 − 𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 ) Equation (1)  𝑖  − (𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 − 𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 )]  Where:  ∆𝑆𝑡 = The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  applicable reservoirs i over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 =  DRAFT  The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  at the end of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t,  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 = The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  at the start of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t,  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 = The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the baseline scenario at the  end of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, expressed in  metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 = The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the baseline scenario at the  start of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, expressed in  metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  𝑖 = The greenhouse gas reservoir(s) identified in paragraph 11 above and  included in the activity boundary of an Article 6.4 activity  𝑡 = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the report of the first  monitoring period 18 Note that ∆S may be determined by monitoring different parameters than those in this equation as long  t  as this delivers an equivalent outcome. For example, in the case of carbon capture and storage in  geological reservoirs, the flux of carbon injected in the reservoir may be a key parameter to estimate the  stock, rather than directly measuring the stock within the reservoir. Similarly, in the land-use sector, the  increment in stocks rather than the total stocks may be measured. For some activities, where direct  measurements are infeasible, it may be appropriate to use mass balances and/or modelling approaches.  23 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 20. A reversal occurs during an Article 6.4 activity’s active crediting period when the net  change in storage is less than zero (∆St < 0) in the monitoring report for any monitoring  period after the first one (i.e., for t ≥ 2), with the quantity of the reversal specified by ∆St.19 21. For monitoring reports used to quantify reversals during an Article 6.4 activity’s post-  crediting monitoring period, mechanism methodologies shall include equations that  determine the net change in storage resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period  of time covered by a monitoring report k in the post-crediting monitoring period, consistent  with the following equation:  Equation (2)  ∆𝑆𝑃𝐶,𝑘 = ∑ [(𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑘 − 𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 )]  𝑖  Where:  The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  ∆𝑆𝑃𝐶,𝑘 = applicable reservoirs i over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report k in the post-crediting monitoring period, expressed in metric  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑘 = at the end of the period of time covered by a monitoring report k in the  post-crediting monitoring period, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  DRAFT  The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 =  at the end of the Article 6.4 activity’s last active crediting period,  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  The greenhouse gas reservoir(s) identified in paragraph 11 above and  i =  included in the activity boundary of an Article 6.4 activity  The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the post-  k = crediting monitoring period, with k = 1 for the first monitoring report in the  post-crediting monitoring period 22. For monitoring reports used to establish that no reversal has occurred in the post-crediting  monitoring period, mechanism methodologies may include provisions to establish that no  reversal has occurred (∆SPC,k ≥ 0) without quantifying the amount of greenhouse gases or  their precursors stored in each applicable greenhouse gas reservoir (Si,activity,end,k). 23. For the purpose of paragraphs 21 and 22, a reversal occurs during an Article 6.4 activity’s  post-crediting monitoring period when ∆SPC,k < 0. 24. The approach set out in paragraphs 21 and 22 will in most instances result in a  conservative quantification of reversals. In few instances, the approach may need to be 19 Note that although the net change in greenhouse gas storage could be negative for t = 1 (∆S1 < 0), this  would not constitute a reversal because no A6.4ERs would have been issued to the Article 6.4 activity  24 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  amended or revised to ensure conservativeness. 20 In such instances, the mechanism  methodology shall include provisions for amending or revising the approach accordingly. 6.2. Net change in emissions of greenhouse gases 25. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine the net change in  emissions resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a  monitoring report t. This shall not include any emissions from losses of storage from the  greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in Equation 1 above.21 The net change in emissions  shall be determined consistent with the following equation:  ∆𝐸𝑡 = ∑ 𝐴𝐸𝑠,𝑡 + max (0, ∑ 𝐿𝐸𝑗,𝑡 ) − ∑ 𝐵𝐸𝑠,𝑡 Equation (3)  𝑠 𝑗 𝑠  Where:  ∆𝐸𝑡 = The net change in greenhouse gas emissions, from sources other than  any losses in storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  Equation 1, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  𝐴𝐸𝑠,𝑡 = Greenhouse gas emissions from source s included in the activity  boundary, occurring in the Article 6.4 activity scenario over the period of  time covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  DRAFT  𝐿𝐸𝑗,𝑡 = Greenhouse gas emissions from leakage source j resulting from the  Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report  t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e).22  𝐵𝐸𝑠,𝑡 = Greenhouse gas emissions from source s in the baseline scenario over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, expressed in metric  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  𝑠 = Emission sources included in the activity boundary in the Article 6.4  activity scenario and baseline scenario, other than emissions from losses  in carbon storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  Equation 1  𝑗 = Leakage sources considered in the mechanism methodology in the  Article 6.4 activity scenario and, where applicable, the baseline scenario 20 For example, a single geological reservoir could be used by different activities, including activities  registered under other carbon crediting programmes or covered by emissions trading schemes. In these  instances, the methodology may need to include additional provisions to allocate any losses to the  different activities. Another example could be an afforestation activity where reversal could occur if no  further carbon is accumulated in the Article 6.4 scenario whereas further carbon would be accumulated  over time in the baseline, i.e. in the absence of the Article 6.4 activity. 21 For example, in the case of an afforestation activity, such emissions may include emissions from road  transportation or fertilizer application but do not include any carbon dioxide emissions from loss of above-  ground biomass, as the latter is included in the term ∆St in Equation 1. In the case of a direct air carbon  capture and storage activity, such emissions could include emissions from consumption of electricity  required for the operation of the capture plant. 22 Note that the maximum of zero and the sum of all leakage emissions is used in Equation 3 because, in  accordance with paragraph 10 of the standard “Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies”,  leakage shall be set to zero if the sum of all sources of leakage results in a net decrease in greenhouse  gas emissions or increase in greenhouse gas removals.  25 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  t = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 6.3. Total A6.4ER issuance 26. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine the total number of  A6.4ERs to be issued for an Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a  monitoring report t, consistent with the following equation:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = ∆𝑆𝑡 − ∆𝐸𝑡 − 𝐶𝐷𝑡−𝑖 Equation (4)  Where:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t  ∆𝑆𝑡 = The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  applicable reservoirs over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  ∆𝐸𝑡 = The net change in greenhouse gas emissions, from sources other than  any losses in storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  Equation 1, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  𝐶𝐷𝑡−𝑖 =  DRAFT  A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an Article 6.4  activity caused by factors other than reversals (a “crediting deficit”),  applicable to the monitoring report t-1 and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  𝑡 = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 6.4. Crediting deficit 27. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine any crediting deficit  resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report  t (CDt), consistent with the following equations:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 ≥ 0, then 𝐶𝐷𝑡 = 0 Equation (5)  If 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 < 0 and ∆𝑆𝑡 ≥ 0, then 𝐶𝐷𝑡 = −1 × 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 Equation (6)  If 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 < 0 and ∆𝑆𝑡 < 0, then 𝐶𝐷𝑡 = max(0, 𝐶𝐷𝑡−1 + ∆𝐸𝑡 ) Equation (7)  Where:  The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t.  26 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  ∆𝑆𝑡 =  applicable reservoirs over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  The net change in greenhouse gas emissions, from sources other than  any losses in storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  ∆𝐸𝑡 = Equation 1, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an Article 6.4  activity caused by factors other than reversals (a “crediting deficit”),  𝐶𝐷𝑡 =  applicable to the monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an Article 6.4  activity caused by factors other than reversals (a “crediting deficit”),  𝐶𝐷𝑡−1 =  applicable to the monitoring report t-1 and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  t =  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report. 28. When the crediting deficit is greater than zero, it reflects a net increase in greenhouse gas  emissions resulting from an Article 6.4 activity due to factors other than reversals. A  crediting deficit can occur when the net change in storage (∆St) over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t is positive, but smaller than a net increase in emissions  over the same time period (i.e., ∆Et ≥ ∆St).23 A crediting deficit can persist from one period  DRAFT  of time to the next, so long as A6.4ER issuance is too small to compensate for the crediting  deficit. If a crediting deficit persists at the end of the last active crediting period, any such  deficit will remain unaddressed. 29. Crediting deficits affect future A6.4ER issuance requests and are adjusted, as applicable,  at each A6.4ER issuance request. When there is a crediting deficit from the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t-1, any non-zero A6.4ER issuance for the period of time  covered by the monitoring report t will be reduced and the crediting deficit updated  accordingly. This can happen in three ways:  (a) If total A6.4ER issuance is greater than or equal to zero (A6.4ERtotal,t ≥ 0), then  Equation 5 applies. This indicates that the quantity of emission reductions and/or  net removals in the period of time covered by the monitoring report t was sufficient  to eliminate the crediting deficit, if any, from the period of time covered by the  monitoring report t-1. If the crediting deficit from the period of time covered by the  monitoring report t-1 is positive, then the A6.ER issuance for the period of time  covered by the monitoring report t is reduced by the same quantity; and if the  crediting deficit from the period of time covered by the monitoring report t-1 is zero,  then the A6.ER issuance for the period of time covered by the monitoring report t  is unchanged. In either case, the crediting deficit for the period of time covered by  the monitoring report t is zero;  (b) If total A6.4ER issuance is less than zero (A6.4ERtotal,t < 0) and the net change in  storage is greater than or equal to zero (∆St ≥ 0), then Equation 6 applies. In this 23 For example, this could occur where an afforestation activity maintains previously achieved carbon  stocks but does not further enhance carbon stocks, while still causing emissions from road transportation.  This could also occur if a bioenergy project with carbon capture and storage or a direct air capture project  stores carbon dioxide in a subsurface geologic reservoir while emitting a greater quantity of carbon  dioxide to the atmosphere from its operations.  27 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  case, there is a crediting deficit for the period of time covered by the monitoring  report t equal to the total A6.4ER issuance (A6.4ERtotal,t) multiplied by negative 1.  This situation occurs when there is no reversal and therefore an overall increase  in total greenhouse gas storage (∆St ≥ 0), but the combination of any net change  in greenhouse gas emissions and any previous crediting deficit is greater than the  net change in greenhouse gas storage (i.e., ∆Et + CDt-1 ≥ ∆St);  (c) If both the total A6.4ER issuance and the net change in storage are less than zero  (A6.4ERtotal,t < 0 and ∆St < 0), then Equation 7 applies. This situation results in a  different formula for the calculation of the crediting deficit because the net loss in  greenhouse gas storage (∆St < 0) is addressed by operations of the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, rather than through reductions in subsequent A6.4ER  issuance. 30. The initial crediting deficit at the start of the first monitoring period t = 1 of an Article 6.4  activity (CD0) is set to zero by definition. 6.5. A6.4ER contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account 31. Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, as follows:  Equation (8)  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑡 = ∑ [𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, ∆𝑆𝑖,𝑡 ) × 𝐹𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑖,𝑡 ]  𝑖  Where:  DRAFT  The number of A6.4ERs that are issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑡 =  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or  first transferred, as applicable, to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account  The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas in greenhouse gas reservoir i, resulting from the Article  ∆𝑆𝑖,𝑡 =  6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  The fraction of the net enhancement in storage of a greenhouse gas or a  precursor in reservoir i, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the  period of time covered by monitoring report t, as determined by the  𝐹𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑖,𝑡 =  reversal risk assessment tool, and used for the purpose of determining  the number of A6.4ERs to be forwarded or first transferred, as applicable,  to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account  The greenhouse gas reservoir(s) identified in paragraph 11 above and  i =  included in the activity boundary of an Article 6.4 activity  The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  t =  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 32. Mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches to determine  A6.4ERbuffer,t if:  (a) The outcome is aligned with the approach in equation 8; or  (b) The proponent of the mechanism methodology justifies, with appropriate evidence,  that a different approach that applies to Article 6.4 activities involving more than  one greenhouse gas reservoir will result in a conservative treatment of reversal  risks.  28 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 6.6. A6.4ER contributions to the Adaptation Fund 33. Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the total number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to an account held by the Adaptation Fund in the mechanism  registry for assisting developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the  adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation, as follows:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑆𝑂𝑃,𝑡 = 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 × 𝑆𝑂𝑃 Equation (9)  Where:  A6.4ERSOP,t = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or  first transferred, as applicable, to an account of the Adaptation Fund in  the mechanism registry  A6.4ERtotal,t = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t  SOP = The share of proceeds designated to support the Adaptation Fund  t = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 34.

Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to the account for cancellation towards delivering overall  mitigation in global emissions, as follows:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑂𝑀𝐺𝐸,𝑡 = 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 × 𝑂𝑀𝐺𝐸 Equation (10)  Where:  A6.4EROMGE,t = The number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission reductions  and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period  of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or first  transferred, as applicable, to the account for cancellation towards  delivering overall mitigation in global emissions  A6.4ERtotal,t = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t  OMGE = The contribution to deliver overall mitigation in global emissions  t = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report  29 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 36. The term OMGE shall be set at a minimum of 2 percent, pursuant to paragraph 95 of  Appendix 1 of decision 3/CMA.3. 6.8. A6.4ER issuance to activity participants 37. Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to the accounts of activity participants as follows:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑡 = 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 − 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑆𝑂𝑃,𝑡 − 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑂𝑀𝐺𝐸,𝑡 − 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑡 Equation (11)  Where:  The number of Article 6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑡 =  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or  first transferred, as applicable, to accounts of the activity participants  The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  A6.4ERtotal,t = reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t.

The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  t =  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 7. Identification and quantification of reversals 7.1. General requirements 38. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the data and methods required to:  (a) Detect changes in the quantity of greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in  all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs, consistent with section 6.1;  (b) Quantify changes in the quantity of greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in  all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs in the Article 6.4 activity scenario and the  baseline scenario, consistent with section 6.1;  (c) Determine whether a reversal has occurred, consistent with section 6.1; and  (d) Classify any reversal as being avoidable, unavoidable, or partially avoidable and  partially unavoidable, consistent with section 7.3.  30 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 39. For the purpose of identifying whether any observed event involving the release of stored  greenhouse gases has led to a reversal, mechanism methodologies may include  provisions to conservatively calculate the total removals expected to occur within the  monitoring period in which the observed event took place. If the total expected removals  within the monitoring period are larger than the sum of emissions from all observed events  involving the release of stored greenhouse gases within the same monitoring period, then  methodologies may determine that no reversal is deemed to have occurred for the purpose  of notifying the Supervisory Body of observed events involving the release of stored  greenhouse gases. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to activity types that  generate ongoing net removals without ongoing interventions by the activity participant,24  and shall not be applied to any other matters, such as quantification of emission reductions  and/or net removals. 40. For the purpose of preparing preliminary assessment reports, mechanism methodologies  shall require activity participants to submit a monitoring report in cases where it is  ambiguous as to whether an observed event of greenhouse gas release constitutes a  reversal. 41. For the purpose of preparing monitoring reports only for the post-crediting monitoring  period and only in cases where no reversal is reported, mechanism methodologies may  establish provisions for activity participants to demonstrate that no reversal has occurred  (i.e., to show that ∆SPC,k ≥ 0) rather than quantify the amount of the net change in storage  (∆SPC,k). 7.2. Frequency of submitting monitoring reports 42.  DRAFT  Mechanism methodologies shall specify the minimum frequency at which monitoring  reports must be submitted during the crediting periods and post-crediting monitoring  period. The minimum frequency shall be between one and five years and be based on the  nature, the type, and the risk of reversals. A less frequent requirement from within this  range (i.e., a larger gap between monitoring reports) is appropriate where the  quantification of emission reductions or net removals is associated with considerable  costs25 and/or where emission reductions or net removals can only be observed over  longer time periods.26 The minimum frequency may also change over time, while being  within the above specified range. 7.3. Determination of whether reversals are avoidable or unavoidable 43. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to classify reversals as avoidable or  unavoidable, taking into the account the type of activities eligible under the methodology.  Where necessary, mechanism methodologies shall also include a procedure to apportion  the total amount of reversals into a portion of avoidable reversals and a portion of  unavoidable reversals. 24 This includes, for example, many forestry activities. 25 For example, costs for sampling the carbon content at plots in the land-use sector. 26 Forexample, changes in soil organic carbon following changes in land-use practices may only be  observable over longer time periods.  31 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 44. Mechanism methodologies shall classify the following types of reversals, inter alia, as  avoidable:  (a) Reversals resulting from the management of the Article 6.4 activity and any other  wilful actions by the activity participants;27  (b) Reversals resulting from mismanagement, neglect or illegal actions by the activity  participants, including as a consequence of bankruptcy, insolvency, or default;  (c) Reversals resulting from the intentional use of a product or material, in which a  greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas was stored under an Article  6.4 activity, such that a greenhouse gas is released to the atmosphere;28  (d) Reversals that have occurred following a failure to implement the risk mitigation  plan that is attributable to the activity participants; and  (e) Reversals deemed to have occurred when an annual reversal report or a  monitoring report is missing, as defined in section 2.3 of Appendix 2. 45. Mechanism methodologies shall classify the following types of reversals, inter alia, as  unavoidable:  (a) Reversals resulting from natural disturbances and extreme events;29  (b) Reversals resulting from declared war, undeclared war, or acts of terrorism;  (c) Reversals resulting from changes in policies or legal requirements that prevent the  activity participants from implementing risk mitigation plans; and  (d) DRAFT  Reversals resulting from illegal action by third parties that cannot be controlled,  influenced or managed using legal means by the activity participants. 46. Reversals caused by any factors that were not identified in an Article 6.4 activity’s reversal  risk assessment(s), as updated, shall be classified as avoidable reversals by default and  may only be classified as unavoidable with due justification (e.g., in cases of clear “force  majeure”). 7.4. Monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period 47. Mechanism methodologies may identify conditions under which activity participants may  or shall update their monitoring plan for the post-crediting monitoring period, e.g., updates  to monitoring techniques or approaches. 48. Mechanism methodologies shall define a minimum period for monitoring during the post-  crediting monitoring period, after which activity participants may submit a request for  termination of monitoring during the post-crediting monitoring period through  demonstration of a negligible risk of reversal. The minimum period shall be informed by,  inter alia, a consideration of the mitigation activity type and its associated reversal risks. 27 For example, harvesting of trees, slash burns, land conversion, changes in land management practices  that were not described in the PDD, induced seismicity or fractures in geological reservoirs due to  injection practices. 28 For example, combustion of biomass previously stored in buildings. 29 For example, wildfires, accidental fires in the built environment, pests and disease infestation, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.  32 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 49. Mechanism methodologies shall define a set of conditions or criteria that must be satisfied  in order for activity participants to demonstrate negligible risk of reversal,30 considering the  mitigation activity type and its associated reversal risks. The conditions or criteria shall  ensure that the greenhouse gases or their precursors that are stored by the Article 6.4  activity within the applicable greenhouse gas reservoir(s) have reached and will remain in  a steady state or, where relevant, are stabilized for at least 100 years from the year of  demonstration of negligible risk of reversal.  DRAFT 30 For example, in the case of sub-surface CO  2 storage, such conditions and criteria may pertain to the  behaviour of the stored CO2 in the geological reservoir. For biochar, conditions and criteria may pertain,  inter alia, to restrictions on applications that could result in the release of the carbon stored in biochar  (such as through combustion) and criteria on the characteristics of the biochar.  33 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 Appendix 2. Elements for inclusion in relevant regulatory  documents 1. This Appendix sets out requirements that are directed to activity participants and DOEs.  The elements in this Appendix shall be included, as applicable, in the:  (a) “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects” (A6.4-STAN-AC-002)1;  (b) “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”  (A6.4-PROC-AC-002)2;  (c) “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry” (A6.4-PROC-REGS-001)3; and/or  (d) “Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects”  (A6.4-STAN-AC-003)4. 1. Reversal-related notifications and reports 1.1. Overview of reversal-related notifications and reports 2. This section establishes requirements in relation to the following types of notifications and  reports:  (a) Notifications of observed event: The purpose of this notification is to inform the  (b) DRAFT  Supervisory Body about an observed event;  Preliminary assessment report: The purpose of this report is to determine whether  an observed event has resulted in a reversal;  (c) Annual reversal report: The purpose of this report is to indicate whether, at any  point in the previous calendar year, any observed events occurred or, if none  occurred, to document that outcome;  (d) Monitoring report: During the crediting periods of an Article 6.4 activity, the purpose  of this report is to quantify emission reductions and/or net removals for issuing  A6.4ERs or to quantify any reversals. For these periods, the provisions on  monitoring reports in this document complement provisions on monitoring reports  in other regulatory documents by elements that are relevant to activities that are  subject to risks of reversals. During the post-crediting monitoring period, the  purpose of this report is to demonstrate that no reversal has occurred or, if  reversals have occurred, to quantify the amount of reversals. 1 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf. 2 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-AC-002.pdf. 3 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-REGS-001.pdf. 4 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-003.pdf.  34 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  Table 1.

Observed events that could lead to a reversal 3. Activity participants shall notify the secretariat of any observed event involving the release  of stored greenhouse gases that could potentially lead to a reversal within 30 days of  becoming aware of the observed event. This notification shall include:  (a)  (b)  DRAFT  A description of the observed event;  The date(s) of the occurrence of the observed event, including a statement  indicating whether the event is ongoing at the time of notification;  (c) The location of the event; and  (d) Any additional information as required by the mechanism methodology. 4. If the secretariat becomes aware of a potential reversal event affecting an Article 6.4  activity, but has not received a notification from the activity participants pursuant to  paragraph 3, the secretariat shall notify the activity participants of its understanding and  request that, within 30 days, the activity participants either provide a notification pursuant  to paragraph 3 or an explanation of why no such notification is required. All notifications  and explanations provided under this paragraph shall be made publicly available. 5. When the secretariat receives a notification pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4, the secretariat  shall suspend the activity-specific registry operations of issuance, transfer, cancellation,  and retirement of A6.4ERs, except for transfers of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. The same registry operations shall be reinstated when an activity participant  satisfies the requirements of paragraphs 8 or 11, as applicable. 6. In the event of notification to the secretariat pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4, activity  participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report to determine whether the  observed event has resulted in a reversal and submit the preliminary assessment report  to the secretariat. The preliminary assessment report shall include:  (a) A description of the activities and methods used to monitor for potential reversals;  (b) A determination of whether a reversal has occurred; and  35 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (c) The data collected to inform the preliminary assessment report’s conclusions,  including remote sensing data where applicable. Activity participants may elect to  summarize the applicable data in the preliminary assessment report, provided that  the complete data are made available to the Supervisory Body as part of the  preliminary assessment report’s submission. 7. Preliminary assessment reports shall be submitted to the secretariat within 90 days of the  end of the observed event. 8. When a preliminary assessment report concludes, on the basis of transparent and  verifiable evidence, that a reversal has not occurred, it shall be verified and submitted  through a DOE. After conducting a completeness check, the secretariat shall forward the  preliminary assessment report to the Supervisory Body along with a recommendation on  whether the Supervisory Body should approve it:  (a) If the Supervisory Body approves a preliminary assessment report that concludes  a reversal has not occurred, it shall notify the activity participants of such approval  and shall instruct the mechanism registry administrator to resume the registry  operations suspended by operation of paragraph 5;  (b) If the Supervisory Body does not approve a preliminary assessment report, the  activity participant shall follow the requirements of paragraph 10. 9. When a preliminary assessment report concludes that a reversal has occurred, it shall not  be verified and shall be submitted directly by an activity participant. In this case, the  preliminary assessment report shall serve only as notice that a monitoring report is  required, and no further actions are required from the secretariat or Supervisory Body. 10. DRAFT  If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the  preliminary assessment report concludes that a reversal has occurred, the activity  participant shall submit, through the DOE, a verified monitoring report to the Supervisory  Body within 365 calendar days of the end of the observed event. The verified monitoring  report shall:  (a) Include a description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) Identify the location of the event in the form of Keyhole Markup Language files or  similar formats as one or more polygon(s) or by specifying the coordinates of the  geographic boundary using a known coordinate system;  (c) Quantify the amount of the reversal by using the upper bound of the uncertainty  interval at a 90 per cent confidence level, with a description of how the amount was  quantified;  (d) Include data, records, and logs related to the observed event of greenhouse gas  release. If the data set is too large, a summary of the data and an indication of how  the full data set can be accessed may be provided in the monitoring report;  (e) Classify the reversals as being avoidable, unavoidable, or partially avoidable and  partially unavoidable. In cases where the reversals are partially avoidable and  partially unavoidable, the monitoring report shall quantify the amount of avoidable  reversals and the amount of unavoidable reversals, with the sum equal to the  amount of the total reversals;  (f) Review the activity’s reversal risk assessment and, if necessary, revise the  percentage contribution the activity makes to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account; and  36 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (g) Review the Article 6.4 activity's compliance with the requirements of the  Sustainable development tool, including by taking into account any negative  environmental or social impacts caused by the reversal and developing or updating  plans to prevent the recurrence of reversal-related negative environmental and  social impacts. 11. Upon the Supervisory Body’s determination that a verified monitoring report submitted  pursuant to paragraph 10 has correctly quantified the magnitude of the reversal and  characterized the type of reversal the following actions shall be taken:  (a) The secretariat shall take the actions described in section 4.1 of this Appendix to  address the avoidable and/or unavoidable reversals identified in the verified  monitoring report;  (b) The activity participant shall take the actions described in section 4.2 of this  Appendix to address the avoidable reversals identified, if any, in the verified  monitoring report; and  (c) Following the satisfactory completion of the actions described in subparagraphs  (a) and (b) as applicable, the secretariat shall reinstate all registry operations that  were previously suspended by operation of paragraph 5. 1.3. Annual reversal report 12. Activity participants shall submit to the secretariat, by 31 March each year, an annual  reversal report that indicates whether, at any point in the previous calendar year, any  observed events involving the release of stored greenhouse gases that could potentially 13.  have led to a reversal.  DRAFT  Annual reversal reports shall be prepared following any guidance provided in the  applicable mechanism methodology regarding the appropriate data and methods for  determining whether any such observed event has occurred. 14. If an annual reversal report indicates the presence of any such observed events, it shall  identify and list them along with the corresponding notification(s) provided to the  secretariat pursuant to paragraphs 3 or 4. 15. If the annual reversal report indicates the absence of any such observed event, it shall  state the basis for this conclusion. 16. Annual reversal reports shall be verified either:  (a) Prior to their submission to the secretariat; or  (b) Retroactively as part of the verification of monitoring reports, such that the  verification of a monitoring report also covers all previously unverified annual  reversal reports that pertain to the time period covered by the verified monitoring  report. 2. Late, incomplete or missing report submissions 17. Monitoring reports, preliminary assessment reports, and annual reversal reports shall be  submitted to the Supervisory Body on or before their respective deadlines.  37 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 18. Activity participants may make a request to extend a deadline by submitting a request to  the Supervisory Body through the secretariat. The secretariat shall review any request and  take the following actions:  (a) When a request is made because the activity participant’s process for DOE  contracting evidence the unavailability of DOEs or because of force majeure, the  secretariat shall automatically approve a single, 90-day extension of the applicable  deadline; and  (b) For all other requests, including requests for extensions beyond those granted  under subparagraph (a), the secretariat shall recommend that the Supervisory  Body grant the extension for any request that is justified with appropriate evidence  or deny the request;  (c) All requests and grants of extension or denials of requests shall be made publicly  available. 19. The Supervisory Body may develop additional guidance and consequences to address  matters not elaborated here, including to address any patterns of late, incomplete or  missing submissions that may arise in practice. 2.1. Late report submissions 20. A monitoring report, preliminary assessment report, or annual reversal report that is not  submitted on or before its deadline shall be designated as late. 21. Whenever a monitoring report, preliminary assessment report, or annual reversal report  DRAFT  has been designated as late, the secretariat shall provide an automated electronic notice  to activity participants that the monitoring report, preliminary assessment report, or annual  reversal report has not been received on time and has therefore been designated as late. 22. Whenever a monitoring report has been designated as late, the secretariat shall suspend  the activity-specific registry operations of issuance, transfer, cancellation and retirement  of A6.4ERs, except for transfers of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. If  an activity participant submits a late monitoring report before it is designated as missing  pursuant to paragraph 32, the secretariat shall reinstate all registry operations that were  previously suspended by operation of this paragraph. 23. Whenever an annual reversal report has been designated as late and it has not been  submitted within 30 calendar days since the notification referenced in paragraph 21, the  secretariat shall suspend the activity-specific registry operations of issuance, transfer,  cancellation and retirement, except for transfers of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. If an activity participant submits a late annual reversal report before it is  designated as missing pursuant to paragraph 34, the secretariat shall reinstate all registry  operations that were previously suspended by operation of this paragraph. 2.2. Incomplete report submissions 24. The secretariat shall, subject to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct within  seven days a completeness check in accordance with the completeness check checklist  for following submission types, as applicable:  (a) Monitoring report submissions;  (b) Preliminary assessment report submissions that conclude an observed event has  not led to a reversal; and  (c) Annual reversal report submissions.  38 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 25. A preliminary assessment report that concludes that a reversal has occurred shall  automatically be deemed to be complete. The secretariat shall not perform a  completeness check for this submission type. 26. If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or  consistency in the submission, it shall request by email the activity participants or the DOE,  copying the activity participants, as applicable, to submit revised documents and/or  information. In this case, the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, shall submit  the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the request.  If the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, does not submit the requested  documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the  request submission is incomplete unless the activity participants or the DOE, as  applicable, provides a justification by this deadline, consistent with the requirements of  paragraph 18, for not submitting the requested documents and/or information on time. In  this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly. 27. Upon conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall notify the activity  participants or the DOE, as applicable, of the conclusion of the completeness check stage.  If the submission does not meet the requirements of the completeness check, the  secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants or  the DOE, as applicable, and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website. In  this case, the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, may resubmit the monitoring  report, preliminary assessment report, or annual reversal report with revised  documentation. The deadline for any such resubmission shall be 60 days from the date of  notification. 28.  DRAFT  Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject  to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct within 21 days a substantive check in  accordance with the substantive check checklist for submissions of monitoring reports,  preliminary assessment reports, and annual reversal reports. 29. If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or  missing basic information, it shall request by email the activity participants or the DOE,  copying the activity participants, as applicable, to submit revised documents and/or  information. In this case, the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, shall submit  the requested documents and/or information within 60 calendar days of receipt of the  request. If the activity participants or DOE, as applicable, does not submit the requested  documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the  request submission is incomplete unless the activity participants or DOE, as applicable,  provides a justification by this deadline for not submitting the requested documents and/or  information on time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly. 30. Upon conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall notify the activity  participants and, where applicable, the DOE of the conclusion of the substantive check  stage. If the submission does not meet the requirements of the substantive check, the  secretariat shall conclude that the submission is incomplete and communicate the  underlying reasons to the activity participants and, where applicable, the DOE, and make  them publicly available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the activity participants or  the DOE, as applicable, may resubmit the monitoring report, preliminary assessment  report, or annual reversal report with revised documentation. The deadline for any such  resubmission shall be 60 days from the date of notification. 31. Any submission deadline established pursuant to paragraph 30 shall be subject to the  provisions for late, incomplete and missing report submissions.  39 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 2.3. Missing report submissions 32. A monitoring report shall be considered missing if it has not been received within 180  calendar days of the date of the notice referenced in paragraph 21. 33. A preliminary assessment report shall be considered missing if it has not been received  within 60 calendar days of the date of the notice referenced in paragraph 21. 34. An annual reversal report shall be considered missing if it has not been received within 90  calendar days of the date of the notice referenced in paragraph 21. 35. Whenever a monitoring report or annual reversal report is designated as missing, the  Article 6.4 activity shall be deemed to have experienced avoidable reversals. The  secretariat shall provide electronic notice to the activity participant and inform the activity  participant that it shall mitigate the avoidable reversals following the provisions of section  4 of this document. 36. The quantity of the avoidable reversals designated in paragraph 35 shall be deemed to be  equal to the total number of A6.4ERs issued with respect to the Article 6.4 activity,  cumulatively from the Article 6.4 activity’s start date through the date that the monitoring  report or annual reversal report is designated as missing, inclusive of the number of  A6.4ERs forwarded or first transferred, as applicable, to:  (a) The activity participants;  (b) The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account;  (c) The mechanism registry account held by the Adaptation Fund; and  (d) DRAFT  The mechanism registry account for cancellation towards delivering overall  mitigation in global emissions. 37. Whenever a preliminary assessment report is designated as missing, the observed event  in question will be deemed to have resulted in a reversal and a monitoring report  submission shall be required pursuant to the terms of paragraph 10. 38. Table 2 summarizes the consequences of late or missing report submissions, as described  above.  Table 2.

Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting 3.1. General obligations and duration of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period 39. For Article 6.4 activities that are subject to reversal risks, activity participants shall continue  to monitor applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs in the post-crediting monitoring period,  applying the provisions of sections 1 and 2, as applicable, to:  (a) Assess and determine whether any reversals have occurred;  (b) Quantify the amount of any such reversals; and  (c) Ensure remediation of reversals subject to the provisions of section 4. 40. The post-crediting monitoring period shall start on the first day after the end of the last  active crediting period. The post-crediting monitoring period shall continue indefinitely or  until one of the conditions in section 3.2 below is satisfied. 41. Activity participants may use a third party to perform monitoring in the post-crediting  monitoring period for the Article 6.4 activity. 42. Activity participants may at any time update their monitoring plan for the post-crediting  monitoring period as part of a request for a post-registration change, subject to any  conditions and provisions included in the mechanism methodology. 43. Activity participants shall submit, through a DOE, a monitoring report for the post-crediting  monitoring period no later than the date it is due, with the due date determined according  DRAFT  to the minimum frequency for the submission of monitoring reports as specified in the  mechanism methodology. If a monitoring report is submitted before the due date (an “early  submission”), the due date for the next monitoring report shall be the date of the early  submission plus the timeframe corresponding to the minimum frequency, as applicable on  the date of the early submission. 3.2. Termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period 3.2.1. Remediation of potential future reversals5 44. Activity participants may request to terminate their monitoring and reporting obligations in  the post-crediting monitoring period if they have mitigated all potential reversals for all  A6.4ERs issued to the Article 6.4 activity for emission reductions and/or net removals that  are subject to a risk of reversal (i.e., considering all issuances to the Article 6.4 activity  from the start of the first crediting period), as referred to in section 6.3 of Appendix 1,  directly through the cancellation of a corresponding number of A6.4ER units from any  Article 6.4 activity to a dedicated cancellation account in the mechanism registry for the  purpose of remediation of future reversals. For any authorised A6.4ERs issued to the  Article 6.4 activity, the cancellation shall be made using authorised A6.4ERs. 45. Once an activity participant has cancelled A6.4ERs pursuant to paragraph 44, it may,  through a DOE, request the Supervisory Body to terminate its monitoring and reporting  obligations in the post-crediting monitoring period at any time during the post-crediting  monitoring period. Within 28 days of receiving such a request, the secretariat shall  determine whether it complies with paragraph 44. If the secretariat determines that the  requirements of paragraph 44 have been satisfied, it shall notify the DOE and activity 5 Note that additional approaches consistent with paragraph 62 of the Removals Standard may be  developed in the future.  41 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  participants that the Article 6.4 activity is relieved of all obligations under section 3.1 and  make this information available on the UNFCCC website. 3.2.2. Negligible risk of reversal 46. At any time after the minimum post-crediting monitoring period defined in an activity’s  mechanism methodology has elapsed, activity participants may submit, through a DOE, a  request to the Supervisory Body to terminate post-crediting period monitoring and  reporting, accompanied by a verification of the conditions and information required. The  request shall demonstrate that:  (a) The stored greenhouse gases, or precursors of greenhouse gases, are at a  negligible risk of reversal, as defined in paragraph 3(g) of Appendix 1, calculated  over at least a 100-year timeframe starting from the year of submission of the  request; and  (b) All conditions or criteria set in the mechanism methodology for termination of post-  crediting period monitoring have been fulfilled. 47. To demonstrate negligible risk of reversal, activity participants shall:  (a) Provide evidence in the form of modelling or other methods, where relevant, about  the long-term stability6 of stored greenhouse gases, or precursors of greenhouse  gases, within the applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs in the presence of all  reversal risks that exist or are reasonably foreseeable based on current scientific  evidence after termination of the monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period for the Article 6.4 activity;  (b) DRAFT  Apply a conservative approach to ensure that the reversal risks are very unlikely  to be underestimated, taking into account the overall uncertainty in their  quantification;  (c) Implement conservativeness in determining the reversal risks (e.g., through  conservative assumptions, parameters, discounts) based on the level of  uncertainty (e.g., assuming higher risk values in case of higher uncertainties);  (d) Consider all causes of uncertainty, including uncertainty in data (e.g.,  measurements), parameters (e.g., representativeness of default values),  assumptions (e.g., projection of the future sequence of events within the project  boundary or space affected by the mitigation activity), and methods (e.g., models  used in quantifying the reversal risk factors and the reversal risk rating);  (e) Use the higher or lower bound, as appropriate, of the uncertainty interval at a 95  per cent confidence level to ensure conservativeness; and  (f) Confirm the outcome of the negligible risk demonstration by sensitivity analysis. A  negative outcome of the sensitivity analysis indicates that the risk of reversal  cannot be classified as negligible. 48. Upon submission of a request for termination of post-crediting period monitoring through  demonstration of negligible risk of reversal as per paragraphs 46 and 47, the secretariat  shall, subject to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, perform a completeness check. 6 As defined in the methodology.  42 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 49. Complete requests for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period submitted to the secretariat shall be posted on the UNFCCC website for  public comments for a period of 30 days. 50. Within 60 days of the completion of the public review process, the secretariat shall make  a draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body to approve or reject the Article 6.4  activity’s request for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period. 51. The Supervisory Body may request additional information from the activity participant,  including based on inputs received during the public comments period, which the  participant shall communicate within 30 days of receiving the request. If the activity  participant fails to respond within this timeframe, the request for termination of monitoring  and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period shall be considered to be withdrawn. 52. If the request for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring  period is approved by the Supervisory Body, activity participants shall be relieved of all  obligations under section 3.1. The secretariat shall inform the DOE and the activity  participants of the approval and publish the decision by the Supervisory Body together  with documentation for demonstration of negligible risk of reversal assessment for the  Article 6.4 activity on the UNFCCC website. 53. When a request for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring  period through demonstration of negligible risk of reversal is rejected by the Supervisory  Body, the activity participants shall not submit a further request for termination of  monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period through demonstration of 4. Post-reversal actions DRAFT  negligible risk of reversal for at least three years. 4.1. Remediating unavoidable reversals 54. When the secretariat has received a complete and verified monitoring report indicating  that unavoidable reversals have occurred, the secretariat, as the registry administrator,  shall cancel A6.4ERs held in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account as follows:  (a) The number of A6.4ERs cancelled shall be equal to the amount of the unavoidable  reversals, as expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;  (b) The number of each type of A6.4ERs cancelled (whether Mitigation Contribution  Units or authorized A6.4ERs) shall be based on the proportion of Mitigation  Contribution Units or authorized A6.4ERs issued for the Article 6.4 activity’s  emission reductions and/or net removals at the time of the reversal;  (c) The cancellation of A6.4ERs from the Article 6.4 activity experiencing the reversal  shall be prioritised over A6.4ERs from other Article 6.4 activities, until no such  A6.4ERs are available in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account; and  (d) According to further criteria that may be specified at a future point in time. 55. The mechanism registry shall indicate that the A6.4ERs were cancelled for the purpose of  remediating unavoidable reversals and publish the serial numbers of A6.4ERs cancelled. 4.2. Remediating avoidable reversals 56. When the secretariat has received a complete and verified monitoring report indicating  that avoidable reversals have occurred, or when an activity is deemed to have experienced  43 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  avoidable reversals subject to section 2.3, the secretariat, as the registry administrator,  shall cancel A6.4ERs held in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account as follows:  (a) The number of A6.4ERs cancelled shall be equal to the amount of the avoidable  reversals, as expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;  (b) The number of each type of A6.4ERs cancelled (whether mitigation contribution  A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs) shall be based on the proportion of mitigation  contribution A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs issued for the Article 6.4 activity’s  emission reductions and/or net removals at the time of the reversal;  (c) The cancellation of A6.4ERs from the Article 6.4 activity experiencing the reversal  shall be prioritised over A6.4ERs from other Article 6.4 activities, until no such  A6.4ERs are available in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account; and  (d) According to further criteria that may be specified at a future point in time. 57. The mechanism registry shall indicate that the A6.4ERs were cancelled for the purpose of  remediating avoidable reversals and publish the serial numbers of the A6.4ERs cancelled. 58. When avoidable reversals occur, activity participants shall forward or first transfer, as  applicable, A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account as follows:  (a) The number of A6.4ERs forwarded or first transferred shall be equal to the amount  of the avoidable reversals, as expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;  and  (b) The number of each type of A6.4ERs cancelled (whether mitigation contribution  DRAFT  A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs) shall be based on the proportion of mitigation  contribution A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs issued for the activity’s emission  reductions and/or net removals, cumulatively from the Article 6.4 activity start date  through the time of the reversal; and  (c) According to further criteria that may be specified at a future point in time. 4.3. Reversals below baseline 59. Only the fraction of a reversal that corresponds to a net change in storage of greenhouse  gases or their precursors for which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be remediated  through the provisions of sections 4.1 and 4.2. Reversals below an Article 6.4 activity’s  baseline, as determined by mechanism methodologies, shall not be remediated through  the provisions of sections 4.1 and 4.2. 60. When an Article 6.4 activity experiences a reversal below its baseline, as determined by  mechanism methodologies, A6.4ERs shall not be subsequently issued for a net change  in storage of greenhouse gases or their precursors, unless the sum of the quantity of  greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs  in the Article 6.4 activity scenario is greater than or equal to the sum of the quantity of  greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs  44 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  in the Article 6.4 activity’s baseline, as determined by mechanism methodologies, with  both sums expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.7 4.4. De-registration of activities 61. When an activity participant makes a request to de-register a registered Article 6.4 activity  that is subject to reversal risks, the following steps shall be taken:  (a) The activity participant shall cancel A6.4ERs, with the number of A6.4ERs  cancelled equal to the number of A6.4ERs that have been issued with respect to  emission reductions and/or net removals from that activity to date, except for those  A6.4ERs that were contributed to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account; and  (b) The secretariat, acting as the registry administrator, shall cancel A6.4ERs held in  the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, with the number cancelled equal to the  number of A6.4ERs that have been issued with respect to emission reductions  and/or net removals from that activity to date and that were contributed to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  02.2 16 September 2025  DRAFT  MEP008, Annex 3.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to  ensure transparency of decision-making and make publicly available its decision-making  framework and decisions, including standards, procedures and related documents.1 2. This document addresses the mandate of the CMA. It will be updated, as required, should  changes to the classes of decisions and types of documents be requested by the  Supervisory Body. 1.2. Objective 3. The objectives of this document are to:  (a) Ensure transparency, consistency and clarity within the body of decisions and  documents issued by the Supervisory Body;  (b) Contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory management under the  Supervisory Body and assist stakeholders in locating requirements of the Article  6.4 mechanism in a timely and efficient manner;  (c) Facilitate the successful operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. Scope 4. This document describes:  (a) The hierarchical relationship between decisions taken by the CMA and decisions  of the Supervisory Body;  (b) The different classes of decisions taken by the Supervisory Body;  (c) The different document types containing these decisions;  (d) The hierarchical relationship between Supervisory Body document types;  (e) The relationship between Supervisory Body decision classes and document types;  (f) The control and limitation of documents issued by the Supervisory Body. 1 See decision 3/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 21 contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1  available at: https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.  3 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0 3. Decision hierarchy between the CMA and the Supervisory  Body 5. The CMA is the ultimate decision-making body of the Article 6.4 mechanism. The CMA  has authority over and provides guidance to the Supervisory Body through the adoption  of decisions, which are published in reports of the CMA. The decisions of the CMA outline  formal expectations with respect to the Article 6.4 mechanism. They set direction and  establish precedents which serve as reference for future decision-making and the basis  for operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism. CMA decisions are treated as mandatory  requirements or rules intended to ensure the successful implementation of the Paris  Agreement.2 6. The Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of the Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under  the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory  Body has authority over and provides guidance to the activities and processes of the  Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the Supervisory Body elaborate upon and  must be consistent with decisions of the CMA. 7. Decisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded in the meeting reports of the Supervisory  Body and their accompanying annexes, which together form the official record of the  proceedings of the Supervisory Body meetings. The authoritative set of documents  containing regulatory decisions is published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website. 4. Supervisory Body decision classes 8. Taking into account both the rule-making and rule-enforcing roles of the Supervisory Body,  decisions of the Supervisory Body are divided into three classes:  (a) Regulatory decisions: relate to the adoption of, or revision to, the Article 6.4  mechanism rules and requirements developed under the direction of the  Supervisory Body, to be followed by the Supervisory Body, its support structure  and stakeholders.3 Regulatory decisions are reflected in the adoption of, or  revisions to, standards (including policy standards, methodologies and  standardized baselines), procedures, tools (including policy and methodological  tools), guidelines and clarifications (including policy and methodological  clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the  Supervisory Body; 2 The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196  Parties at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris, on 12 December and entered  into force on 4 November 2016. Information on the Paris Agreement, including the text of the agreement,  is available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement. 3 ‘Support structure’ refers to, for example, experts, supporting bodies established by the Supervisory  Body and/or the secretariat. ‘Stakeholder’ refers to the entities, groups, fora, communities or individuals  that have a role in the implementation of the functions of the Supervisory Body or that may affect or be  directly affected by the recommendations and actions of the Supervisory Body .  4 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  (b) Rulings: relate to the determination of whether the actions of participants of an  activity4 under the Article 6.4 mechanism, applicant entities (AEs), or designated  operational entities (DOEs) are in compliance with the Article 6.4 mechanism rules  and requirements. Rulings of the Supervisory Body are published in the main body  of the meeting reports of the Supervisory Body and/or as separate documents;  (c) Operational decisions: relate to the functioning of the Supervisory Body and its  support structure (for example, experts, supporting bodies and secretariat) and  include decisions on finance; administration; programmes of work; internal  operating procedures; and the establishment of supporting bodies. Operational  decisions are either published within the main body of the meeting reports of the  Supervisory Body or reflected in the adoption of, or revision to, internal  standards, procedures and guidelines, or in the publishing of information notes.

Document types 9. The body of documents developed under the direction of the Supervisory Body that serve  to operationalize the Article 6.4 mechanism, includes:  (a) Standards: Standards are designed to achieve a uniform approach to compliance  with the rules, modalities and procedures for the Article 6.4 mechanism (RMP). A  standard describes mandatory levels of performance and/or provides mandatory 4 The activity may be a project, programme of activities or other type of activity approved by the  Supervisory Body, as paragraph 31(b) of the rules, modalities and procedures for the Article 6.4  mechanism.  5 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  specifications and as such sets out the requirements against which compliance is  evaluated. Article 6.4 mechanism standards include:  (i) Policy standards: A standard relating to the activity cycle, accreditation, the  development and/or application of methodologies or standardized baselines,  or governance of the Article 6.4 mechanism (which is not a methodology or  standardized baseline);  (ii) Methodologies: A baseline and monitoring methodology that prescribes  requirements to establish the baseline scenario, demonstrate additionality,  define the activity boundary, and calculate and monitor greenhouse gas  (GHG) emission reductions5 for Article 6.4 mechanism activities;  (iii) Standardized baselines: A baseline developed for a Party on a sub-national  or national basis to facilitate the calculation of GHG emission reductions  and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 mechanism activities,  while providing assistance for assuring environmental integrity;  (b) Procedures: A procedure contains a mandatory series of actions that must be  undertaken to demonstrate in a uniform and consistent way that the Supervisory  Body, the secretariat, activity participants, DOEs/AEs, and designated national  authorities (DNAs) comply with the RMP and the standards issued by the  Supervisory Body. Procedures contain requirements with regard to regulatory  processes in the Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle and in the accreditation of  operational entities, and operational processes of the Supervisory Body and its  support structure;  (c) Tools: A tool is a means of demonstrating (e.g. by calculating, determining,  estimating, elaborating, identifying or testing) that a specific requirement in a  standard or procedure is met. A standard or procedure indicates whether the use  of a tool is voluntary or mandatory. A voluntary tool cannot be mandatory. Article  6.4 mechanism tools include:  (i) Policy tool: Supports or is a part of a standard or procedure relating to the  activity cycle, accreditation, the development of methodologies or  standardized baselines, or governance of the Article 6.4 mechanism (which  is not a methodological tool);  (ii) Methodological tool: A standardized, stepwise approach to determine or  establish parameters, or identify information, and/or demonstrate  requirements relating to, or for application in, Article 6.4 mechanism  activities;  (d) Guidelines: A guideline contains supplemental information such as recommended  methods for satisfying requirements identified in the RMP or standards and  procedures issued by the Supervisory Body or best practice examples. Guidelines  are designed to promote a uniform approach to compliance with the applicable  standards or procedures; 5 ‘Emission reductions’ – Reducing emissions, increasing removals and mitigation co-benefits of  adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans are collectively referred to as ‘emission  reductions’ in this document.  6 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  (e) Clarifications: A clarification is issued to alleviate confusion relating to the  application of requirements in a regulatory standard or procedure. Two types of  clarifications are issued by the Supervisory Body:  (i) Policy clarification: A policy clarification is published as an annex to the  report of a Supervisory Body meeting. It does not change the scope of the  requirement(s) that it is clarifying. A policy clarification is transitory in nature,  pending the subsequent revision of the related policy standard or procedure  which takes into account and incorporates the clarification;  (ii) Methodological clarification: A clarification issued in response to an  activity participant(s), DOE or other stakeholder wishing to seek clarification  on a methodology, standardized baseline, or a methodological tool. A  methodological clarification is issued in accordance with the relevant  procedure;  (f) Information notes: An information note contains factual and/or analytical  information on a particular subject matter relating to the Article 6.4 mechanism  rules and requirements, rulings of the Supervisory Body (that is, the reasons for  the decision), or the functioning of the Supervisory Body and its support structure.  Information notes do not contain requirements and may be published as annexes  to the Supervisory Body meeting annotated agendas or reports, and/or directly in  the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website in cases where  the secretariat is mandated to produce such notes;  (g) Forms: Forms are used to capture data or information required in Article 6.4  mechanism processes. A form contains pre-defined fields to be filled in by activity  participants, AEs/DOEs or DNAs. Completing and submitting forms is part of a  series of actions (how to) required by the RMP, or a standard or procedure issued  by the Supervisory Body. Forms are published directly in the Article 6.4  Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website;  (h) Glossaries: A glossary is an alphabetical list of terms relating to the Article 6.4  mechanism issued by the Supervisory Body to facilitate a common understanding  of terminology used in documentation of the Article 6.4 mechanism;  (i) Recommendations: A recommendation is a document recommending, endorsing  or supporting a course of action. Recommendations from support structures to the  Supervisory Body are published as annexes to the meeting reports of the support  structure, or directly published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the  UNFCCC website. Recommendations from the Supervisory Body to the CMA may  be published as annexes to the meeting reports of the Supervisory Body and are  included in the Supervisory Body’s annual report to the CMA.  7 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0 Figure 2.

Control and limitation of documents issued by the  Supervisory Body 10. When considering issuing a new document or revising and existing document, the  Supervisory Body keeps in mind the priority to consolidate, streamline and ensure  consistency of all its documentation. 11. Documents issued by the Supervisory Body, with the exception of methodological tools,  can be amended as described below:  (a) Substantive revision: When substantive changes are made to a document, the  document is replaced with a new document version and issued with a new primary  version number;  Example: Version 2.0 of a document is replaced by version 3.0, where the number  “3” indicates a substantive change to the information contained in the document.  (b) Corrective or editorial revisions: Corrections or editorial changes do not  constitute a substantive revision to the document. When corrections or editorial  9 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  changes are made to a document, the document is re-issued under the same  primary version number;  Example: Version 2.0 of a document is replaced by version 2.1, where the number  “1” indicates a revision due to corrections or editorial changes.  (c) Withdrawal: Documents are withdrawn from active circulation when the  information they contain is no longer applicable, relevant, or correct. 12. To increase transparency and ensure that users are aware of the latest versions of the  Supervisory Body’s regulatory documentation:  (a) The version containing substantive changes will be recorded in and annexed to the  meeting report of the Supervisory Body and published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory  Body section of the UNFCCC website. The latest version of the document becomes  effective; unless otherwise stated in the meeting report or in the document itself,  on the date of publication of the meeting report in which the document was revised;  (b) The version containing the changes of a corrective or editorial nature will be  published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website and  will become applicable on the date of publication. Documents having undergone  corrective or editorial revisions will be noted in the next meeting report of the  Supervisory Body. Unless otherwise stated in the revised document, a grace  period will apply between the date of publication of the version containing the  corrective or editorial revisions in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the  UNFCCC website and the official notification of the corrective or editorial revisions  in the next meeting report of the Supervisory Body;  (c) Stakeholders are encouraged to regularly review the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body  section of the UNFCCC website to ensure that they have the latest versions of  documents, especially for forms that are required as part of a submission process  in the Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle. 13. Each published Supervisory Body document includes on its last page a “Document  information” box which contains contextual information, including the nature and date of  changes made to the document. Readers should routinely consult this information when  making use of a document.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 10 March 2023 SB 004 Annex 4  Initial adoption.

Introduction 1. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement1 established three instruments for Parties to use in  pursuing voluntary cooperation when implementing their nationally determined  contributions (NDCs): cooperative approaches involving the use of internationally  transferred mitigation outcomes (Article 6, paragraph 2); a mechanism to contribute to the  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6,  paragraph 4); and non-market approaches to enable cooperation on mitigation,  adaptation, and the development of clean energy sources (Article 6, paragraph 8). 2. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA) adopted, at its third meeting, the “Rules, modalities and procedures for  the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”.2 This  “rulebook” delineates principles, key requirements and processes of the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism),  including the establishment of a Supervisory Body. The CMA requested the Supervisory  Body to consider and further develop various elements in the rules, modalities and  procedures for its operationalization. 3. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  (CMP) decided, through its decision 2/CMP.16,3 to authorize the transfer of USD 30 million  from the Trust Fund for the Clean Development Mechanism to the Trust Fund for  Supplementary Activities to facilitate the expedited implementation of the Article 6.4  mechanism by the Supervisory Body. 4. The Resource Allocation Plan 2024–2025 (RAP 2024–2025) provides an estimated  budget for the Supervisory Body to carry out its work in 2024–2025 as specified in its  workplan, as well as other activities deemed essential to operationalize the Article 6.4  mechanism. 2. Strategic vision and goals 5. The strategic vision of the Supervisory Body is to provide a mechanism that actively  contributes to the global mitigation of emissions and sustainable development, as  mandated in Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement. It aims do this through a high-  quality, robust, and inclusive multilateral crediting mechanism that demonstrates the  highest environmental integrity standards and by aiming to become a benchmark-setter. 6. To support the achievement of the RAP 2024–2025, the Supervisory Body will strive to  accomplish the goals described in the following: 1  Paris Agreement available at: https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-  change-conference-november-2015/paris-agreement. 2  See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 (decision 3/CMA.3) available at:  https://unfccc.int/documents/460950. 3  See document FCCC/KP/CMP/2021/8/Add.1 (decision 2/CMP.16) available at:  https://unfccc.int/documents/460957.  3 of 18  A6.4-INFO-GOV-007 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025 Version 01.0 2.1 Goal 1: Facilitate the implementation of mitigation activities through the  prompt operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing and  adopting efficient and effective procedures, processes and infrastructure 7. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Operate efficient activity assessment processes with a focus on meeting all  timelines without compromising the quality of assessments;  (b) Operate an effective accreditation framework through the development of  accreditation standards and procedures that are clear and easy to apply while  ensuring the broadest possible regional availability of designated operational  entities (DOEs);  (c) Provide effective and user-friendly infrastructure that facilitates the participation of  public and private entities in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by  enabling access and ease of use;  (d) Continuously review and improve the procedures, processes and infrastructure for  the Article 6.4 mechanism in a nimble manner as both a driver of innovation and  by being responsive to innovation and best practices as they emerge in the carbon  credit markets. 2.2 Goal 2: Set the global benchmark for high environmental integrity in the  quantification of mitigation outcomes from activities 8. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Operate an effective methodology development process that supports the needed  transformational change, and facilitate the achievement of ambitious emission  reductions and enhancements of long-term removals;  (b) Engage the best expert knowledge by applying a science- and evidence-based  approach;  (c) Ensure transparent and inclusive processes for the engagement of stakeholders  and local communities;  (d) Take a leading role in the discussions on environmental integrity standards for  carbon crediting through outreach and engagement with other crediting standards  and initiatives. 2.3 Goal 3: Enable Party and non-Party stakeholders to understand and  participate in the Article 6.4 mechanism 9. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Support the highest quality of submissions through the development and  strengthening of designated national authorities, DOEs, activity participants, and  other stakeholders’ capacity and skills regarding the requirements of the Article 6.4  mechanism;  (b) Present and protect a positive image of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing  and proactively disseminating information and materials that promote awareness  of the Article 6.4 mechanism and its benefits;  4 of 18  A6.4-INFO-GOV-007 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025 Version 01.0  (c) Empower host Parties to use the Article 6.4 mechanism as part of their national  approaches to support the achievement of ambitious NDCs and long-term low-  emission development strategies by promoting greater understanding of how the  Article 6.4 mechanism works in their interests. 2.4 Goal 4: Ensure that the Article 6.4 mechanism achieves an equitable regional  distribution of Article 6.4 activities and an equitable sharing in benefits from  those activities 10. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Promote the regional distribution of Article 6.4 activities and ensure that no Party  is left behind by ensuring the adaptability of the Article 6.4 mechanism to local  conditions and actively engaging with potential host Parties through the provision  of support by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  Regional Collaboration Centres, including by the facilitation of market access;  (b) Promote the broadest possible participation and ensure that benefits are shared  by all, taking into consideration the interests of host Parties, public and private  investors, and the users of the Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions  (A6.4ERs). 2.5 Goal 5: Nurture the demand for Article 6.4 emission reductions from the  Article 6.4 mechanism 11. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Engage with regulatory authorities and other entities on the use of authorized  A6.4ERs for NDC achievement by showcasing the potential of the Article 6.4  mechanism to supply the highest quality credits while ensuring that double-  counting is avoided;  (b) Take the necessary steps to ensure that the Article 6.4 mechanism is a leading  supplier of mitigation outcomes for use in other international mitigation purposes,  specifically through direct engagement with existing regulatory and national bodies  and with any future market-based mechanism that may be developed;  (c) Engage with public and private stakeholders using mitigation contribution units  (MCUs) for national policy and voluntary purposes by promoting the use of MCUs  for reporting on the climate impact of activities financed through the purchase and  voluntary cancellation of MCUs as results-based finance; and/or engage with  public and private entities contributing to the achievement of the host Party’s NDC.  5 of 18  A6.4-INFO-GOV-007 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025 Version 01.0 Appendix.

(c) Expert costs include panels attendance fees and case fees and costs of experts who provide technical input to  the Supervisory Body.  (d) Expert travel includes ticket costs and daily subsistence allowance (DSA) of panels members.  (e) Travel of representatives includes ticket cost and DSA for participants in meetings and workshops.  (f) Travel of representatives (Supervisory Body) includes ticket costs and DSA.  (g) Travel of staff costs includes staff, consultants’ and individual contractors’ ticket costs, DSA, terminal expenses  and miscellaneous expenses.  (h) Training costs include staff attendance or course fees, consultant costs for training, ticket costs and DSA.  (i) Operating expenses include rental of equipment, shipping and transport costs, maintenance costs, other logistics  costs, supplies and materials.  (j) Total cost of ownership (TCO) – Service programmes in the secretariat (Information and Communication  Technology and Administrative Services) render services to all secretariat activities funded from both core and  non-core sources of funding. The purpose of TCO charges is to ensure the allocation of costs of these support  services to the sources of funding to which they relate. In 2024 and 2025, the TCO charge per capita of EUR  15,460 will be applied.  (k) Engagement agreement (Information Technology) includes IT-related costs to support the implementation of the  Resource Allocation Plan, including the development and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the  Article 6.4 mechanism information system.  (l) Programme support costs (PSC) – In accordance with the financial procedures of the United Nations, 13 per cent  of overhead charges are payable on all trust funds of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC) to cover administrative services provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva and the  UNFCCC secretariat. 7. For 2024 and 2025, the estimate for staffing needs are 52 staff and 63 staff, respectively.  The increase in proposed staff costs, compared to the indicative budgets, mainly reflects  the rise in statutory costs. The secretariat applies the United Nations rules governing  salaries and employee benefits. Salary and common costs for staff on fixed-term contracts  are calculated using standard rates for each grade. The United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change rates are determined based on a historical analysis of a  set of staff cost parameters such as pay scales and employee benefits. This resulted in a  change in standard salary staff rates for all levels. 8. The consultants cost category in the budget proposals is indicative. 9. The increase in travel of representatives is primarily due to the addition of costs related to  the participation of representatives in the designated national authority regional forums. 10. The increase in travel of representatives — Supervisory Body is due to the addition of  costs related to the participation of two members to the Regional Climate Weeks. 11. The increase in the travel of staff budget also reflects a general increase in travel costs. 12. The increase in operating expenses is due to additional costs for regional forums. 13. The training cost category in the budget proposals is indicative. 14. The increased engagement agreement (IT) cost category in the budget proposals,  compared to the indicative budgets, reflects the development cost of IT systems such as  the development and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the Article 6.4  mechanism information system. IT development costs for 2024–2025 are initial estimates  17 of 18  A6.4-INFO-GOV-007 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025 Version 01.0  and are likely to increase during 2024–2025, taking into account increased clarity on  business requirements (scope and scale of development needed), and may require  budget adjustments. 4. Ensuring the prudent management of resources 15. The secretariat prudently manages and monitors resource allocations against priority  areas of work to ensure the optimal use of available staff in delivering high-quality products  on time. 16. A total of 52 posts are included in the RAP for 2024, and 63 posts are included for 2025,  compared to 33 posts in 2023. The proposed RAP estimates a resource need of 550  person-months (roughly equivalent to 52 staff) in 2024 and 664 person-months (about  63 staff) in 2025 to execute the proposed activities. 17. The Supervisory Body will have opportunities to review the implementation of its RAP  2024–2025 and adjust the allocation of resources as appropriate, considering relevant  decisions made by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to  the Paris Agreement.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 14 September 2023 SB 007, Annex 1.

Introduction 1. The Supervisory Body of the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris  Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Article 6.4 mechanism), at its seventh meeting1,  adopted a Resource Allocation Plan (RAP) for 2024 – 2025, which provides a budget for  the Supervisory Body to implement its work, as well as other activities deemed essential  to operationalize the Article 6.4 mechanism2. 2. This document includes and complements the Mid-year review report3 published in  October 2024 and describes the status of implementation of the RAP for the period  1 January through 31 December 2024, the activities underway, and the financial and  human resources of the secretariat’s Mitigation Division, which supports the Supervisory  Body and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. Progress report on outputs and resources utilized 3. In 2024, the secretariat delivered outputs related to the following areas: (i) strategic  coordination and oversight of the Article 6.4 mechanism; (ii) activity cycle;  (iii) methodologies; (iv) regulatory management; (v) registry; (vi) governance;  (vii) capacity-building; (viii) engagement; (ix) communications; and (x) cross-cutting. 2.1. Status of planned outputs 4. Tables 1-14 below show the status of outputs as of 31 December 2024 against the  planned outputs for 2024. 1 See document A6.4-INFO-GOV-007, paragraph 10, available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-007.pdf 2 Ibid. 3 See document A6.4-SBM014-AA-A02 available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A64-  SBM014-AA-A02.pdf  3 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0 Table 1.

See document A6.4-INFO-GOV-007 available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-007.pdf 5 The forecasted volume estimates may be further reviewed and updated in the course of implementation of RAP 2024-25. 6 Where appropriate, clarifications have been provided in the status of outputs when the actual volume is zero in the reporting period. 7 Non-staff costs refer to expenses on consultants, experts, travel, operating expenses and training.  4 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0  Approved non-  Forecasted  Actual volume6 staff costs7 Actual  Outputs Goals4 Activities Units volume5  (USD)  2024 December 2024 2024 December 2024  At SB 010, five members were appointed to the AEP for a term of two years (until 31 March 2026), and the first meeting of the AEP (AEP 001) took place on  25 and 26 April 2024; the AEP 002 took place on 19 September 2024.  During AEP 001, the AEP appointed two ARoE evaluators, resulting in the appointment of 26 experts to the ARoE based on their evaluations. At SB 011, the  Supervisory Body took note of the report from AEP 001, which included the selection of the ARoE.  According to paragraph 32 of the report of the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body, 30 clean development mechanism (CDM) designated operational  entities (DOEs) are authorized to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism. Three  CDM DOEs withdrew their CDM accreditation status after the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body; therefore, 27 CDM DOEs are allowed to verify and  certify transitioned CDM activities and their current status has been updated on the Article 6.4 public website. A total of 14 applications for initial accreditation  under the Article 6.4 mechanism were received and are currently undergoing processing in accordance with the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation  procedure8 adopted at SB 008. Overall, 41 entities are under administration, which is higher than the forecasted value due to the implementation of the SB  008 decision which authorized 30 CDM DOEs to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities to the Article 6.4  mechanism without conducting an accreditation assessment. Due to the same decision, the actual value of assessment planning is 14 which is less than the  forecasted value. During the reporting period, there were no complaints or requests for review raised in accordance with the Article 6.4 accreditation  procedure.  The DOE performance monitoring procedure was considered at AEP 002 and subsequently adopted at SBM 014. 9 Therefore, the performance monitoring  system will be implemented once submissions are received. 8 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation (A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001) available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf. 9 At SB 011, the Supervisory Body adopted ‘SBM’ (with \"M\" signifying \"of the Mechanism\") to refer to its meetings.  5 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0 Table 2.

In the latter, an information note summarizing the comments was submitted for consideration at SBM 013. Currently, 14 entities have applied for Article 6.4 accreditation at various stages of the process, including two initial accreditation on-site assessments in progress and one initial accreditation on-site assessment completed. Regular surveillance will be conducted after the completion of the initial accreditation on- site assessments. Based on the actual timelines on the accreditation application progress amongst those 14 entities, there was no regular surveillance  6 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0  Approved non-  Forecasted  Actual volume staff costs Actual  volume Outputs Goals Activities Units (USD)  2024 December 2024 2024 December 2024 conducted during this reporting period. Also, as no transition requests were approved by the Supervisory Body during the reporting period, verification for the transition activities has not started and therefore no performance assessments were launched during the reporting period. The calibration workshop of assessment team leads (AT calibration workshop) and the DOE calibration workshop were held on 3–4 and 16–17 September 2024, respectively. The DOE performance monitoring procedure was considered at AEP 002 and subsequently adopted at SBM 014. Therefore, the performance monitoring system will be implemented once submissions are received.  7 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0 Table 3.

These two submissions have been processed.  The validation of new activities under the Article 6.4 mechanism has not started as there are no available Article 6.4 methodologies. Once the host Party  approvals and subsequent submission of transition requests are received, the secretariat will process these cases, which shall include assessments on  sustainable development and non-permanence carried out by the project proponents without the DOE’s intervention; this may extend the preparation time for  the transition submission requests. The secretariat will also process requests for registration, renewal and inclusion once received.  9 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0 Table 4.

The vendor responsible for the development of the MIS has been contracted and workstreams have been initiated. Additionally, several interim solutions to  the MIS were defined and developed to meet the deadlines proposed by the Supervisory Body and support submissions made in 2024 and early 2025.  On the development side:  • Technical and non-technical requirements were thoroughly prepared, laying a strong foundation for the project.  • Around 1,000 user stories were developed in areas such as methodologies, accreditation, transition, fee processing, prior consideration, issuance,  modality of communication, registration, and access management, guiding the development teams.  • An interim vendor was contracted to develop the first workflow based on Camunda technology, the central infrastructure of the Article 6.4 mechanism,  for the CDM transition and to train staff during the procurement process.  • The final vendor was onboarded in October 2024, and since then significant progress has been made, including defining architecture, onboarding the  latest Camunda version, implementing scalable workflow solutions, starting the development of the final version of the transition process, and  designing user-friendly interfaces for different platforms to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.  10 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0  Approved non-  Forecasted  Actual volume staff costs Actual  Outputs Goals Activities Units volume  (USD)  2024 December 2024 2024 December 2024  On the operational side:  • The secretariat addressed over 2,000 submissions and resubmissions for transitioning from the CDM to the Article 6.4 mechanism, handling changes  to modalities of communication, technical issues, completeness checks, and general inquiries through a dedicated portal created as an interim  solution.  • Documentation from nearly 100 DNAs was received, reviewed, stored and published within the expected timeframes. Over 600 prior consideration  notifications were processed and published using dedicated workflows and interfaces for PoAs and project activities.  • Twelve accreditation entities submitted documentation using a dedicated interface.  • Front ends for prior considerations, transition, DNAs, and methodologies were created to provide the expected transparency to the process.  During the reporting period, 1,379 Project Cycle – Project Activities (PC-PA), 67 Project Cycle – Programmes of Activities (PC-PoA), 15 Project Cycle –  Component Project Activities (PC-CPs) and 1,624 transition requests were submitted, analysed, responded to, and published. Additionally, 10 Party approvals  for transitioning CDM activities were processed and made publicly available.  To facilitate these activities, solutions, interfaces, and public webpages were developed and utilized for efficient submission management.  11 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0 Table 5.

Submissions of new methodologies are expected to start in 2025, following the approval by the Supervisory Body and  endorsement of the Methodologies and Removal Standards 11 by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement  (CMA). Requests for clarification, deviation from, and revision of methodologies will commence once CDM methodologies transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism, tentatively scheduled to start in 2025.  At its first meeting (MEP 001), the Methodologies Expert Panel (MEP) considered 29 items 12 and launched a call for public input on the revision of two CDM  methodologies and a methodological tool13 for their application under the Article 6.4 mechanism. During MEP 001, the MEP agreed to launch a call for public 11 See Standard “Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf and the Standard “Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4  mechanism” https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf. 12 See the MEP 001 meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-MEP001.pdf. 13 ACM0001: Flaring or use of landfill gas, ACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources, and TOOL07.  13 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0  inputs on “ACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources” and “TOOL07: Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity  system” to gather stakeholder feedback for potential revisions applicable to the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP will continue to consider revisions to the  methodology and TOOL07 based on stakeholder feedback at the next meeting in 2025. Additionally, it launched a call for public input on “ACM0001: Flaring  or use of landfill gas”.  During its second meeting (MEP 002), the MEP considered 31 items 14 and launched a call for public input on the standard for demonstration of additionality in  mechanism methodologies.15 The MEP also prioritized work on the standards for setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies; demonstration of  additionality in mechanism methodologies; and addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies. MEP 003 also prioritized developing a concept note on  large-scale crediting methodologies, and revision of 12 CDM methodologies and tools. The guidance developed under these standards and tools could  potentially impact the further development of other products.  During its third meeting (MEP 003), the MEP considered 20 items16 and the MEP finalized the draft “Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism  methodologies” and agreed to launch a call for public inputs. The MEP will update the aforementioned baseline standard, taking into account the inputs  received, with the aim to make a recommendation to the Supervisory Body at a future meeting in 2025.  At SB 011, an update on the preparations related to engaging with Parties and stakeholders during the UNFCCC sessions in June 2024 in Bonn was  discussed to facilitate the work on documents developed by the Supervisory Body at SB 009, namely, A6.4-SB009-A01: “Requirements for the development  and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” and A6.4-SB009-A02: “Activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. Guidance  was provided by the Supervisory Body to the secretariat in this regard.  At SBM 012, the Supervisory Body considered the information notes “Compilation and analysis of stakeholder inputs on the requirements for Article 6.4  methodologies” and “Compilation and summary of stakeholder inputs on activities involving removals under Article 6.4 mechanism.” The secretariat was  requested to update these notes based on inputs received at the Supervisory Body’s engagement event at the sixtieth session of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB  60) and feedback provided during SBM 012. Subsequently, an information note was prepared for SBM 013.

The secretary to the Supervisory Body, Mitigation Division managers and Team Leads  regularly briefed the Chairs of the Supervisory Body on upcoming meeting agendas and strategies. At the SB 011, the UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon  Stiell attended one session, reaffirming the secretariat’s support for the Supervisory Body and the Article 6.4 mechanism. To ensure timely and high-quality  outputs, measures such as strategic planning, review processes, and quality assurance were implemented, fostering consistency, coherence, and continuous  improvement across workstreams.  At SB 010, the Supervisory Body agreed to refer to the Article 6.4 mechanism as the “Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism” in external communications,  following thorough due diligence process. Subsequently, at SB 011, after the secretariat’s analysis of formal or informal name changes to avoid confusion with  the acronym ‘SB,’ the Supervisory Body adopted ‘SBM’ (with \"M\" signifying \"of the Mechanism\"). No CMA decision was required for this change.  During the reporting period, communication efforts significantly broadened engagement with the Article 6.4 community. Communication products delivered  included:  32 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0  • Quarterly communication evaluations: Three comprehensive evaluation reports for Q1, Q2 and Q3 2024 were prepared and shared with the  Supervisory Body;  • Newsletters: 14 newsletters (20,000 total reads) were sent to the Article 6.4 community, with a subscriber base that increased from 1,720 in January  2024 to 2,563 by December 2024 (49 per cent increase);  • Press releases and media monitoring: Four press releases were issued and featured on the UN Climate Change website, including a section on  Article 6 outcomes in the UNFCCC closing press release for COP29.

(m) Includes obligations. 6. Column (d) in table 15 shows the rate of expenditure as a percentage against the 2024  budget for each cost category. The total rate of expenditure (56.6 per cent) is below the  linear rate of expenditure (100 percent) for the reporting period. 7. Staff costs amount to 60.7 per cent of the 2024 budget for this object of expenditure which  is significantly lower than the linear rate of 100 per cent. The lower rate is due to the timing  between the selection and onboarding of recruited staff and due to prudent resource  management including capitalizing on the synergies with human resources supporting  other areas of work. 8. Consultant costs amount to 140.0 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of  expenditure, which is higher than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The  higher expenditure rate is due to obligations (48 per cent of the total consumed USD 733,  812) for which the services are to be received in 2025. 9. The expert fees amount to 27.3 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of  expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per  cent). This reflects the fees for the two meetings of the AEP and three meetings of the  MEP processed in the period. 10. Expert travel amounts to 58.3 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of  expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per  cent). This represents travel costs of the in-person meetings of the panels and working  groups in 2024. 11. With regard to travel of representatives, there were no meetings, workshops or other  events during the reporting period. 12. Travel of Supervisory Body members amounts to 39.8 per cent of the projected 2024  budget for this object of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of  expenditure (100 per cent). This represents the cost of the in-person meetings of the  regulatory body. 13. Travel of staff amounts to 36.4 per cent of the 2024 budget for this object of expenditure,  which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The lower  expenditure reflects reduced staff participation in events outside of Bonn, due to prudent  resource management. 14. Training costs amount to 19.2 per cent against the projected 2024 budget, which is  significantly lower than the linearly projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The lower  rate is due to prudent resource management. 15. Operating expenses amount to 30.7 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object  of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per  cent). This is due to fewer meetings held throughout the year than anticipated. 16. Engagement agreement costs, IT-related, costs amount to 52.1 of the 2024 budget for this  object of expenditure, which is lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent).  39 of 40  A6.4-INFO-GOV-023 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) Version 01.0  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 2 May 2025 Initial publication.

Introduction 1. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement1 established three instruments for Parties to use in  pursuing voluntary cooperation when implementing their nationally determined  contributions (NDCs): cooperative approaches involving the use of internationally  transferred mitigation outcomes (Article 6, paragraph 2); a mechanism to contribute to the  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6,  paragraph 4); and non-market approaches to enable cooperation on mitigation,  adaptation, and the development of clean energy sources (Article 6, paragraph 8). 2. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA) adopted, at its third meeting, the “Rules, modalities and procedures for  the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”.2 This  “rulebook” delineates principles, key requirements and processes of the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism),  including the establishment of a Supervisory Body. The CMA requested the Supervisory  Body to consider and further develop various elements in the rules, modalities and  procedures for its operationalization. 3. At its 14th meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body adopted new  standards facilitating the creation, purchase, and sale of carbon credits. These standards  outline methodologies for crediting emissions reductions or removals and provide  guidance for developing and accessing Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies, with these  it ensures transparency, credibility, and the avoidance of leakage, as well as addressing  risks in emissions projects. The CMA took note of these developments, marking a  significant step toward operationalizing a global carbon market under the Paris  Agreement. 4. The Resource Allocation Plan 2026–2027 (RAP 2026–2027) presented in this document  provides an estimated budget for the Supervisory Body to carry out its work in 2026–2027  as specified in its workplan, as well as other activities deemed essential to operationalize  the Article 6.4 mechanism. The RAP 2026-2027 takes into consideration the need for  flexibility in deploying resources and was prepared noting that the funding shortfall in 2025  had required the implementation of contingency measures to limit expenditures to 72.8 %  of the initial budget, and that the prudent management of resources will need to continue  in the biennium 2026-2027. 2. Strategic vision and objectives 5. The strategic vision of the Supervisory Body is to provide a mechanism that actively  contributes to the global mitigation of emissions and sustainable development, as  mandated in Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement. It aims do this through a high-  quality, robust and inclusive multilateral crediting mechanism that demonstrates the  highest environmental integrity standards and by aiming to become a benchmark-setter. 1  See document, The Paris Agreement available at:  https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-change-conference-november-  2015/paris-agreement. 2  See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 (decision 3/CMA.3) available at  https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.  3 of 23  A6.4-INFO-GOV-024 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 Version 01.0 6. To support the achievement of the RAP 2026–2027, the Supervisory Body will strive to  accomplish the following objectives and related goals: 2.1 Objective 1: Prompt operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism as a  global benchmark for high-integrity carbon credits 7. The Supervisory Body intends to focus its primary efforts on getting the Article 6.4  mechanism operational and “open-for-business” so that it can take its place as the only  multilaterally agreed and governed crediting mechanism that can be the global benchmark  for high integrity carbon credits. Once achieved, this objective will evolve into one focused  on maintaining the operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism and that it remains ‘fit-for-  purpose’. 2.1.1 Goal 1: Develop and adopt efficient and effective procedures, processes, and  infrastructure 8. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Operate efficient activity assessment processes with a focus on meeting all  timelines without compromising the quality of assessments;  (b) Operate an effective accreditation framework through the development of  accreditation standards and procedures that are clear and easy to apply while  ensuring the broadest possible regional availability of designated operational  entities (DOEs);  (c) Provide effective and user-friendly infrastructure that facilitates the participation of  public and private entities in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by  enabling access and ease of use;  (d) Continuously review and improve the procedures, processes and infrastructure for  the Article 6.4 mechanism in a nimble manner as a driver of innovation and by  being responsive to innovation and best practices as they emerge in the carbon  credit markets;  (e) Support Parties and stakeholders through the completion of the transition of  eligible projects and certified emissions reductions (CERs) from the clean  development mechanism to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2.1.2 Goal 2: Set the global benchmark for high environmental integrity in the  quantification of mitigation outcomes from activities 9. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Operate an effective methodology development process that supports the needed  transformational change, and facilitate the achievement of ambitious emission  reductions that are real, additional and verifiable as well as enhancements of long-  term removals;  (b) Engage the best expert knowledge by applying a science- and evidence-based  approach;  (c) Ensure transparent and inclusive processes for the engagement of stakeholders  and local communities;  4 of 23  A6.4-INFO-GOV-024 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 Version 01.0  (d) Take a leading role in the discussions on environmental integrity and  harmonization of standards for carbon crediting through outreach and engagement  with other crediting standards and initiatives. 2.2 Objective 2: To support the effective utilization of the Article 6.4 mechanism  by the full range of stakeholders 10. Once the Article 6.4 mechanism is sufficiently operational, the Supervisory Body will  increase its focus on enhancing the use of the Article 6.4 mechanism by stakeholders,  while noting that some activities will be undertaken to support this objective in parallel with  the objective above. 2.2.1 Goal 3: Enable Party and non-Party stakeholders to understand and participate in  the Article 6.4 mechanism 11. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Support the highest quality of submissions through the development and  strengthening of the capacity and skills of designated national authorities, DOEs,  activity participants and other stakeholders’ regarding the requirements of the  Article 6.4 mechanism;  (b) Present and protect a positive image of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing  and proactively disseminating information and materials that promote awareness  of the Article 6.4 mechanism and its benefits;  (c) Empower host Parties to use the Article 6.4 mechanism as part of their national  approaches to support the achievement of ambitious NDCs and long-term low-  emission development strategies by promoting greater understanding of how the  Article 6.4 mechanism works in their interests. 2.2.2 Goal 4: Promote that the Article 6.4 mechanism achieves an equitable regional  distribution of Article 6.4 activities and an equitable sharing in benefits from those  activities 12. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Promote the regional distribution of Article 6.4 activities and ensure that no Party  is left behind by ensuring (i) the adaptability of the Article 6.4 mechanism to local  conditions, (ii) its usability, and (iii) the minimization of its transaction cost and by  actively engaging with potential host Parties through the provision of support by  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Regional  Collaboration Centres, including by the facilitation of market access;  (b) Promote the broadest possible participation and ensure that benefits are shared  by all, taking into consideration the interests of host Parties, public and private  investors, and the users of the Article 6, paragraph 4, mitigation outcomes  (A6.4ERs (either as MCUs3 or AERs4)). 3 Article 6, paragraph 4, emissions reductions (mitigation contribution A6.4ERs), as per decision 6/CMA.4,  annex, paragraph 29(b) 4 Article 6, paragraph 4, emissions reductions (authorized A6.4ERs), as per decision 6/CMA.4, annex,  paragraph 29(a)  5 of 23  A6.4-INFO-GOV-024 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 Version 01.0 2.2.3 Goal 5: Enable demand for Article 6.4 mitigation outcomes from the Article 6.4  mechanism 13. Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:  (a) Engage with public and private stakeholders using MCUs for national policy and  voluntary purposes by promoting the use of MCUs for reporting on the climate  impact of activities financed through the purchase and voluntary cancellation of  MCUs as results-based finance; and/or engage with public and private entities  contributing to the achievement of the host Party’s NDC.  (b) Engage with regulatory authorities and other entities on the use of AERs for NDC  achievement by showcasing the potential of the Article 6.4 mechanism to supply  the highest-quality credits while ensuring that double-counting is avoided;  (c) Take the necessary steps to ensure that the Article 6.4 mechanism is a leading  supplier of mitigation outcomes for use in other international mitigation purposes,  specifically through direct engagement with existing regulatory and national bodies  and with any future market-based mechanism(s) that may be developed.  6 of 23  A6.4-INFO-GOV-024 Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 Version 01.0 Appendix.

Status of outputs 5. As outlined in paragraph 32 of the report3 of the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body (SB 010), 28 clean development mechanism (CDM)  designated operational entities (DOEs) were authorized to verify and certify requests for issuance of transitioned CDM activities. Their  current status was updated on the Article 6.4 mechanism public website4 until 30 September 2025. 6. In addition, one Article 6.4 DOE was accredited at SBM 015, and 16 applicant entities (AEs) have been undergoing initial accreditation  assessments in accordance with accreditation procedure of the Article 6.4 mechanism5 adopted at SB 008. 7. A total of 22 entities were under administration, exceeding the estimated volume for the reporting period. However, only four assessments  were undertaken, which is below the estimated volume for the reporting period. This is due to the implementation of the above-mentioned  SB 010 decision, which allows 28 CDM DOEs to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities under  the Article 6.4 mechanism without undergoing additional accreditation assessment. 8. During the reporting period, there were no complaints or requests for review raised in accordance with the accreditation procedure of Article  6.4 mechanism. 9. The DOE performance monitoring procedure considered at the second meeting of the Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP 002) and adopted  at SBM 014 will be implemented once activity submissions requesting registration and issuance under Article 6.4 mechanism are received. 3  Meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/SB010_report.pdf. 4  https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/accreditation#CDM-DOEs-conducting-verification-of-requests-for-issuance-of-  transitioned-activities. 5  Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation (A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001) available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf.  5 of 37  A6.4-INFO-GOV-025 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) Version 01.0 2.1.2.

Please see document: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-SBM016.pdf.  35 of 37  A6.4-INFO-GOV-025 Status of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) Version 01.0 83. Column (d) in table 2 shows the rate of expenditure as a percentage against the 2025  budget for each cost category. The total rate of expenditure (43.8 per cent) is below the  linear rate of expenditure (50 percent) for the reporting period. 84. Staff costs amount to 31.1 per cent of the 2025 budget for this object of expenditure, which  is significantly lower than the linear rate of 50 per cent. The lower rate is due to prudent  resource management, including capitalizing on the synergies with human resources  supporting other areas of work. 85. Consultant costs amount to 68.3 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of  expenditure, which is higher than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The  higher expenditure rate is due to obligations for which the services are yet to be received. 86. The expert fees amount to 17.3 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of  expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per  cent). The expenditure includes the fees for the two meetings of the MEP processed in  the period. 87. Expert travel amounts to 52.7 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of  expenditure, which is slightly higher than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent).  This represents travel costs of the in-person meetings of the panels and working groups  in 2025. 88. With regard to travel of representatives, there were no charges during the reporting period. 89. Travel of Supervisory Body members amounts to 35.1 per cent of the projected 2025  budget for this object of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of  expenditure (50 per cent). This represents the cost of the in-person meetings of the  regulatory body. 90. Travel of staff amounts to 38.4 per cent of the 2025 budget for this object of expenditure,  which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The lower  expenditure reflects reduced staff participation in events outside of Bonn, due to prudent  resource management. 91. Training costs amount to 10.9 per cent against the projected 2025 budget, which is  significantly lower than the linearly projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The lower  rate is due to prudent resource management. 92. Operating expenses amount to 31.2 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object  of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per  cent). The lower rate is due to prudent resource management. 93. Engagement agreement (IT) costs amount to 76.6 per cent of the 2025 budget for this  object of expenditure, which is significantly higher than the projected rate of expenditure  (50 per cent). The prudent management of resources enabled the secretariat to absorb  additional funding needs for continued critical IT development. 3. Conclusions 94.

Notwithstanding items 7.7 through 7.11 herein, if a valid and enforceable agreement  exists between the disputing parties that contains a dispute resolution mechanism,  such mechanism shall take precedence and shall be the exclusive means for  resolving disputes between those parties, in lieu of the dispute resolution procedure  set forth in these Terms and conditions; provided, however, that such mechanism  shall not conflict with, override, or purport to waive any of the provisions contained in  items 7.1 through 7.5 and 7.12 of these Terms and conditions.  9 of 11  A6.4-INFO-REGS-001 Information note: Terms and conditions for entity account holders Version 01.0  7.13.

Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism). 1 Chapter XI.A of the RMPs contains provisions that allow  transition of project activities and programmes of activities (PoAs) registered under the  clean development mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol or listed as  provisional as per the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Board of the CDM 2  (hereinafter referred to as provisional requests) to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated key conditions and processes for such  transition. 3 At the same session, the CMA also requested 4 the Supervisory Body to  facilitate the tasks related to the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism  by:  (a) Developing and operationalizing a procedure for requesting transition, which  includes relevant forms, by no later than June 2023;  (b) Developing and operationalizing the transition process and reporting back to the  CMA at its fifth session. 3. The CMA, at its sixth session 5 , decided that afforestation and reforestation project  activities and PoAs registered under the CDM may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism,  and be registered as Article 6.4 activities. The CMA also elaborated key conditions for  such a transition. 4. Pursuant to its mandate from the CMA to operationalize the transition process, the  Supervisory Body has adopted the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article  6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the transition standard) and the “Procedure:  Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as this  procedure) and relevant forms as contained in this document. 5. The Supervisory Body at its 16th meeting agreed to provisions on avoidance of double  issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities. The Supervisory  Body further decided to require the use of re-evaluated values for the fraction of non-  renewable biomass (fNRB) and the discount factor for the leakage for activities using CDM  methodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission reductions. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Scope 6. This procedure sets out procedural steps for CDM project activities, PoAs and component  project activities (CPAs) therein to transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism, as well as  corresponding procedural steps for provisional requests to be finalized under the Article  6.4 mechanism. 3. Entry into force 7. This document enters into force on 16 May 2025. 4. Terms and definitions 8. The following terms apply in this procedure:  (a) “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;  (b) “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action  is recommended as particularly suitable;  (c) “May” is used to indicate what is permitted;  (d) “The project participant” shall be read as the focal point entity designated by the  project participants of the CDM project activity or PoA for scope (c) as  communicated to the secretariat in the modalities of communication in accordance  with the relevant provisions in the “CDM project cycle procedure for project  activities” and the “CDM project cycle procedure for programmes of activities”,  respectively”.6  (e) “CDM project activity”, “PoA” and “CPAs” encompass CDM emission reduction and  CDM A/R activities, unless otherwise specified;  (f) “PDD”, “PoA-DD” and “CPA-DD” encompass the respective forms for CDM  emission reduction and CDM A/R activities, unless otherwise specified. 5. Process for transition 5.1. Submission of transition request 9. The project participant of a CDM project activity or PoA other than a CDM A/R project  activity or CDM A/R PoA and CPAs therein, that is eligible for transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard shall, if it  wishes for such transition, submit a request for transition to indicate the wish of transition 6 In accordance with paragraph 42 of the “CDM project cycle procedure for project activities” (version 03.0)  and paragraph 33 of the “CDM project cycle procedure for programmes of activities” (version 03.0), the  focal point entities designated by the project participants for scope (c) are granted the authority to  communicate on their behalf with the Board and the secretariat on all other project-related matters not  covered by: (a) communication in relation to requests for forwarding of certified emission reductions to  individual accounts of the project participants; or (b) communication in relation to requests for addition  and/or voluntary withdrawal of the project participants and focal points, as well as changes to company  names, legal status, contact details and specimen signatures.  4 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the  information in the form contained in appendix 1,7 by 31 December 2023, 24:00 (Central  European Time). 10. The project participant of a CDM A/R project activity or CDM A/R PoA and the CPAs  therein, that is eligible for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the  relevant provisions of the transition standard shall, if it wishes to transition, submit a  request to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website. The  project participant shall provide the information in the form contained in Appendix 1 by 31  December 2025, at 24:00 hours (Central European Time). 11. In requesting the transition of a CDM PoA that had included CPAs under the CDM, the  project participant shall specify which of the included CPAs that are eligible for transition  to the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition  standard it wishes to transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism. CPAs included in a PoA  under the CDM may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in conjunction with, or  subsequent to, the transition of the PoA to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 12. The secretariat shall check the completeness of the information provided in the submitted  request for transition and, if found complete, publish the request on the UNFCCC website  providing the web link to the project information page of the CDM project activity or CDM  PoA on the UNFCCC CDM website, and assigning a unique reference number(s) that  enable(s) the identification of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein,  transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, distinguishing them from new activities  registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall  promptly notify the reason for the incompleteness to the project participant. The project  participant shall submit a corrected request for transition within 14 days of the notification;  otherwise the secretariat shall reject the request. 13. After publishing the request for transition on the UNFCCC website, the secretariat shall  promptly inform the DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism and the DNA for the CDM of the  host Party of the CDM project activity or PoA of the receipt of the request. If the host Party  has not yet established the DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism, the secretariat shall inform  its national focal point to the UNFCCC (hereinafter collectively referred to as the DNA for  the Article 6.4 mechanism) of the request.8 With this, the request for transition shall be  deemed as having been submitted by the project participants to both the secretariat and  the host Party in accordance with paragraph 73(a) of the RMPs. 5.2. Global stakeholder consultation 14. Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC admitted observer organizations may submit  comments, in English, on the transition of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs  therein, to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website within 28  days of the publication of the request for transition on the UNFCCC website. The  submitters of the comments shall provide the names and contact details of the individuals 7 The secretariat may convert the form into an electronic interface. 8 The contacts of national focal points of Parties to the UNFCCC are listed at:  https://unfccc.int/process/parties-non-party-stakeholders/parties/national-focal-point.  5 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  or organizations on whose behalf the comments are submitted. Comments from  stakeholders shall:  (a) Be specific to the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, being requested  for transition;  (b) Be related to the compliance with applicable rules and regulations for transition. 15. The secretariat shall make the comments that meet the requirements in paragraph 14  above publicly available on the UNFCCC website where the transition request is displayed  and inform the Supervisory Body and the DNAs of the host Party and other Parties  involved that the comments have been made public. 16. For a CDM PoA being requested for transition, after the global stakeholder consultation  but before the approval by the host Party of the transition in accordance with section 5.3  below, the project participants may:  (a) Add eligible CPAs not specified in the initial transition request referred to in  paragraph 11 above; and/or  (b) Remove from the transition request any CPAs specified in the initial transition  request. 17. For the cases referred to in paragraph 16 above, the project participants shall submit a  revised transition request to the secretariat through the dedicated interface on the  UNFCCC website referred to in paragraphs 9 above or 10 above, reflecting the addition  and/or removal of CPAs that they wish to transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in  conjunction with, or subsequent to, the transition of the PoA. The secretariat shall check  the completeness of the revised transition request and, if it is found to be complete, shall  publish it on the UNFCCC website, replacing the initial transition request, and promptly  inform the DNAs for the Article 6.4 mechanism and the DNAs for the CDM of the host  Parties of the receipt of the revised transition request. The revised transition request is not  required to undergo a new global stakeholder consultation. 5.3. Submission of host Party approval 18. The host Party of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, regarding which a  request for transition has been published on the UNFCCC website shall, if it approves  such transition, submit an approval of transition from its DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism  to the Supervisory Body through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing  the information in the form contained in appendix 2,9 by 31 December 2025, 24:00 (Central  European Time). 19. The least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) may  include information, either when submitting their participation requirements to the Article  6.4 mechanism or at the approval stage of an activity, on whether they choose not to  exempt the CDM project activity or PoA and CPAs therein, hosted in their territories and  requesting transition, from the share of proceeds for adaptation. 20. Notwithstanding paragraph 19 above, if an LDC or SIDS host Party has already submitted  its participation requirements or provided approval for a CDM project activity or PoA and 9 The secretariat may convert the form into an electronic interface.  6 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  CPAs therein hosted in their territories and requesting transition, by the time of entry of  force of version 4 of this procedure, the LDCs and SIDS, may provide information on  whether they choose not to exempt the CDM project activity or PoA and CPAs therein  from the share of proceeds for adaptation by resubmitting the participation requirements  and/or the approval form at the latest by 31 December 2025 or at first issuance, whichever  is earlier. If no such information is received by the deadline, the exemption from the share  of proceeds for adaptation shall be effected. 21. A multi-country PoA may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism provided that at least one  host Party has provided approval within the deadline referred to in paragraph 18 above. If  there is more than one host Party for a CDM PoA10 being requested for transition, only the  CPAs in the host Parties that have submitted an approval of transition by the deadline may  transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the transition  of the PoA. 22. The project participant or DOE (hereinafter collectively referred to as the proponent) may  proceed with the submission of the additional documentation referred to in section 5.4  below after at least one host Party has submitted an approval of transition. If the proponent  wishes to transition any of the CPAs specified in the transition request subsequent to the  transition of the CDM PoA, the proponent shall prepare the additional documentation  referred to in section 5.4 below for each such transition request of CPAs. 23. The host Party may submit an approval of transition only after it has fulfilled the  requirements for participating in the Article 6.4 mechanism referred to in paragraph 26 of  the RMPs by demonstrating the fulfilment in accordance with the relevant provisions in the  “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” or the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure  for programmes of activities”, as applicable. 24. If the host Party approves the transition, it shall provide a statement of authorization on  the use of A6.4ERs to be issued for the project or PoA and CPAs therein as early as  possible but prior to the first issuance of A6.4ERs for the project, PoA and CPAs therein.11  The host Party shall provide such a statement by completing a form, through a dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website. 25. If the host Party has indicated that it allows mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be issued  for the project or PoA and CPAs therein, while noting that it may authorize the A6.4ERs  at a later stage, the respective rules and requirements shall be applied as per the  respective provisions of the procedures “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedures  for projects” and “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of  activities”. 26. The secretariat shall publish the host Party approval of transition on the UNFCCC website  and promptly inform the project participant of the receipt of such approval. 10 Under the CDM, a PoA may be designed beyond the border of a country and thus could have more than  one host Party, while a project activity shall be designed within the border of a country and thus will  always have only one host Party. 11 As per decision -/CMA.6 (Advance unedited version).

Submission of additional documentation 27. If the project participant continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology to the  transitioning CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, in accordance with the  relevant provisions in the transition standard, it shall, within 180 days for emission  reduction projects and PoAs of the publication of the host Party approval of transition in  accordance with paragraph 26 above and before 31 December 2025 for CDM A/R projects  and PoAs, submit to the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC  website, an addendum to the respective project design document (PDD), or PoA design  document (PoA-DD) and CPA design documents (CPA-DDs), using the form contained in  appendix 312 to attest that the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, have been  implemented in accordance with the registered PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, as well  as to demonstrate the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the  Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition  standard. With the attestation in the addendum, the relevant PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-  DDs, shall be deemed submitted by the project participant. 28. Notwithstanding paragraph 27 above, for CDM A/R project activities or CDM A/R PoAs  and the CPAs therein that have successfully transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the  PPs shall request a designated operational entity (DOE) accredited in the relevant sectoral  scope under the Article 6.4 mechanism to validate and assess compliance of the additional  documentation with the respective applicable requirements for activities involving  removals under the mechanism contained in the standard “Requirements for activities  involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applicable methodological  regulatory document approved by the Supervisory Body. This validation shall occur in  conjunction with verification for first issuance. 29. If the project participant voluntarily replaces, or is required to replace, the CDM  methodology currently applied to the transitioning CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs  therein, with an Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter referred to as mechanism  methodology) in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard, it shall  revise the PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, accordingly, using the corresponding forms  developed for Article 6.4 mechanism activities, and request a designated operational entity  (DOE) accredited in the relevant sectoral scope under the Article 6.4 mechanism to  validate them to demonstrate appropriate application of the mechanism methodology and  the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the Article 6.4  mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard. If the  validation outcome is positive (i.e. the mechanism methodology is appropriately applied  and the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the Article 6.4  mechanism is demonstrated), the DOE shall, within one year of the publication of the host  Party approval of transition in accordance with paragraph 26 above or within one year  after the applicable mechanism methodology becomes available, whichever is later,  submit to the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, the  revised PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, as well as the validation report. 5.5. Processing of transition request 30. The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the additional documentation referred to in paragraph  27 or 29 above, issue a statement of the transition fee due, determined based on the  following principles, and shall communicate it to the project participant or the DOE who 12 The secretariat may convert this form into an electronic interface for the submission of the addendum.  8 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  submitted the additional documentation (hereinafter collectively referred to as the  proponent):  (a) Requests for transition of CDM project activities, PoAs and CPAs are subject to  the share of proceeds applicable to requests for registration of projects and PoAs  and inclusion of component projects (CPs), respectively, under the Article 6.4  mechanism;13  (b) All fees for requests for registration, issuance, renewal and post-registration  changes to project activities and PoAs as well as inclusion of CPs under the Article  6.4 mechanism are waived for activities in least developed countries and small  island developing States.14 31. The project participant shall pay the transition fee by bank transfer, quoting the unique  reference number(s) referred to in paragraph 12 above. The project participant shall  submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated interface on the  UNFCCC website. 32. The paid transition fee may be reimbursed in full or partially if the request for transition is  withdrawn by the proponent in accordance with section 7 below or rejected by the  Supervisory Body in line with the corresponding provisions on the reimbursement of the  registration fee as contained in the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” or the  “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. 33. The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the proof of payment of the transition fee if it is due,  or upon receipt of the additional documentation if the transition fee is not due, commence  the completeness check of the additional documentation for transition requests for CDM  project activity, or PoA and CPAs for which the host Party(ies) provided approval as per  section 5.3 above. To commence the completeness check, the secretariat shall prioritize  requests for transition for small-scale CDM project activities and CDM PoAs. 34. The secretariat shall conclude the completeness check within seven days of its  commencement. If, during the completeness check, the secretariat identifies issues of an  editorial nature or of consistency in the documentation, it shall request the proponent to  submit revised documents to correct them. In this case, the proponent shall submit the  requested documents within two days of receipt of the request. Upon receipt of the revised  documents, the secretariat shall resume15 the completeness check. If the proponent does  not submit the requested documents by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that  the request submission is incomplete and inform the proponent that the request for  transition cannot be processed any further. The proponent may restart the process by  submitting the additional documentation again with the revised documents in accordance  with section 5.4 above, which is subject to a new transition fee. 35. Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall commence the  substantive check of the additional documentation to determine whether the transitioning  CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, complies with the relevant requirements  for transition contained in the transition standard within 21 days of its commencement. 13 In accordance with decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, paragraph 14(a). 14 In accordance with decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, paragraph 58. 15 The same deadlines apply to the resumed completeness check as applicable to the initial completeness  check.  9 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  Upon conclusion of the substantive check, the secretariat shall publish the additional  documentation and indicate the completion of the substantive check on the UNFCCC  website and notify the host Party and the Supervisory Body of the completion of the  substantive check to initiate the review process in accordance with section 5.6 below. If,  during the substantive check, the secretariat identifies substantive issues that may be  resolved by revising the additional documentation, it shall request the proponent to submit  revised documents to resolve them. In this case, the proponent shall submit the requested  documents within seven days of receipt of the request. Upon receipt of the revised  documents, the secretariat shall resume16 the substantive check. If the proponent does  not submit the requested documents by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that  the request submission is incomplete. 36. The secretariat shall prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the  transition request, summarizing its findings in respect of the compliance with the relevant  requirements for transition contained in the transition standard and including its  recommendation whether to approve the requested transition within 14 days of the date  of publication of the additional documentation. 5.6. Requesting review of transition request 37. The host Party of the transitioning CDM project activity or PoA, or any member or alternate  member of the Supervisory Body, may request a review of the request for transition within  28 days of receipt of the notification of the completion of the substantive check in  accordance with paragraph 35 above, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC  website, providing reasons for requesting a review. 38. If a review of the request for transition is requested by the host Party or any member or  alternate member of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall:  (a) Notify the proponent that the request is under review;  (b) Indicate such status on the UNFCCC website, and request the project participant  and/or the DOE to:  (i) Provide responses to the issues identified in the request for review no later  than seven days from the date of notification that the request has been  placed under review;  (ii) For each issue (or sub-issue) raised in the request for review, the project  participant and/or the DOE (if applicable) shall either:  a. Respond by making any revisions that they deem necessary to the  relevant documentation, submitting revised documents in track  changes and final versions; or  b. Respond in writing, explaining why no revisions to the documentation  are necessary. 16 The same deadlines apply to the resumed completeness check as applicable to the initial completeness  check.  10 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1 39. The secretariat shall present the case to the Supervisory Body at its next meeting or  electronically. 40. For cases applying a new Article 6.4 methodology, as set out in paragraph 29 above, the  review process shall follow the procedures specified in the “Article 6.4 activity cycle  procedure for projects” and the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for PoAs”, as  applicable. 5.7. Finalizing transition request 41. If no review of the request for transition is requested by the deadline referred to in  paragraph 37 above, the request for transition shall be deemed approved by the  Supervisory Body. 42. Stakeholders, project participants, the host Party or other participating Parties (hereinafter  referred to as “eligible individuals, communities and organizations that have standing for  filling an appeal”) may, in accordance with the appeal and grievance procedure,17 file an  appeal to the Supervisory Body’s decision to approve the transition18 within 28 days of the  request for transition being deemed approved. If no appeal is filed by an eligible  stakeholder, project participant or Party within this time frame, the transition shall be  deemed final. If an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project participant or Party  within this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed. 43. If a review of the request for transition is requested, the Supervisory Body shall review the  request and take one of the following decisions, taking into account the presentation on  the case by the secretariat:  (a) Approve the request;  (b) Conditionally approve the request, provided that the project participants agree to  the modifications to the additional documentation proposed by the Supervisory  Body;  (c) Reject the request. 44. For the case referred to in paragraph 43(b) above, if the proponent does not agree with  the modification within seven days of the decision, the request shall be deemed rejected  by the Supervisory Body. 45. The secretariat shall notify the decision of the Supervisory Body to the proponent, the host  Party and the DOE (if applicable), and indicate it on the UNFCCC website. 46. If the decision of the Supervisory Body is to reject the request for transition, the proponent  may not resubmit a request for transition of the same CDM project activity, or PoA and  CPAs therein. 47. If the decision of the Supervisory Body is to approve the transition of the CDM project  activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, the secretariat shall inform the Executive Board of the 17 “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism” (A6.4-PROC-GOV-006).  See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-006.pdf. 18 For decision on finalization of the provisional request for issuance the deadline for appeal is 14 days as  per the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”.  11 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  CDM of the decision. The secretariat shall register the activity under the Article 6.4  mechanism, to be effective on the day it is deregistered from the CDM. 48. Eligible stakeholders, project participants and Parties may, in accordance with the appeal  and grievance procedure, file an appeal against the decision of the Supervisory Body  within 28 days of the decision19. If no appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project  participant or Party within this time frame, the decision of the Supervisory Body shall be  deemed final. If an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project participant or Party  within this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed. 49. Irrespective of the effective date of transition, the crediting period of the transitioned project  activity and CPAs as well as the PoA period of the transitioned PoA under the Article 6.4  mechanism shall start from 1 January 2021. 50. Once registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the transitioned project activities, PoAs  and CPAs for which the host Party(ies) provided approval as per section 5.3 above shall  be subject to all relevant requirements under the Article 6.4 mechanism at all subsequent  steps in the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism, taking into account the relevant  provisions in the transition standard. 51. For a multi-country PoA that has transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, if the transition  is processed without having an approval of transition by all host Parties:  (a) Any remaining host Parties may be added to the PoA and the CPAs hosted in those  countries may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism after the transition of the PoA  in accordance with paragraph 21 above;  (b) If any remaining host Parties miss the deadline for providing an approval of  transition referred to in paragraph 18 above, addition of these host Parties to the  PoA is still possible by undergoing the post-registration change process under the  Article 6.4 mechanism, but the CPAs hosted by these countries and included in the  transition request may no longer transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism;  (c) A new host Party may be added to the transitioned PoA in accordance with the  relevant provisions under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 6. Process for finalizing provisional requests 52. Process for finalization of provisional requests shall follow the provisions in section 5  above, mutatis mutandis, with the following modifications:  (a) The project participant may submit a request for finalization of a provisional request  for issuance under the transition procedure if the underlying CDM project activity  or PoA continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition,  and only after the Supervisory Body has approved the transition of the underlying  CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, to the Article 6.4 mechanism. In  this case, the deadline for submission for the transition request referred to in  paragraph 9 above is not applicable and additional documentation to be submitted  in accordance with paragraph 27 above shall be: 19 See footnote 18.  12 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  (i) A revised monitoring report instead of an addendum to the PDD, or PoA-DD  and CPA-DDs, recalculating the emission reductions by applying:  a. The global warming potentials for the period from 1 January 2021 as  specified in the transition standard; and  b. The updated fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) value and  the discount factor for addressing leakage in accordance with the  requirements of transition standard for activities using CDM  methodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission  reductions.  (ii) A declaration on avoidance of double issuance including, when the activity  has been registered or is registered under another scheme, a confirmation  from the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals being requested for issuance as A6.4ERs have not been  credited and have not been requested for crediting under the other crediting  scheme using a form published on the UNFCCC website20.  (b) Provisional inclusion of CPAs may be finalized if the underlying CDM PoA  continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition, and only  in conjunction, or subsequent to, with the transition of the CDM PoA to the Article  6.4 mechanism. For this reason, the project participant shall include provisionally  included CPAs in the request for transition of the underlying CDM PoA in  accordance with section 5 above;  (c) For finalization of the provisional request for issuance 21 and the provisional  inclusion of CPAs22 referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, respectively,  an approval of the finalization by the host Party shall not be required; therefore,  section 5.3 above shall be skipped;  (d) The project participant may not submit a request for finalization of the following  provisional requests, noting that the corresponding requests may be submitted  under the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the relevant requirements and  processes applicable to any Article 6.4 mechanism activities, after the Supervisory  Body has approved the transition of the underlying CDM project activity, or PoA  and CPAs therein, to the Article 6.4 mechanism:  (i) Provisional requests for issuance if the underlying CDM project activity, or  PoA and CPAs therein, voluntarily replaced, or were required to replace, the 20 The forms are available on the UNFCCC website at  https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-body/rules-  and-regulations. 21 A request for finalization of a provisional request for issuance may be finalized after the underlying CDM  project activity, or after the underlying PoA and CPAs therein, has successfully transitioned to the Article  6.4 mechanism in accordance with paragraph 52(a) above, for which the host Party approval has been  provided. 22 A request for finalization of a provisional inclusion of a CPA may be finalized only in conjunction with, or  subsequent to, the underlying PoA has successfully transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism in  accordance with paragraph 52(b) above, for which the host Party approval has been provided.  13 of 24  A6.4-PROC-AC-001 Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 05.1  currently applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology in  accordance with paragraph 29 above;  (ii) Provisional requests for renewal;  (e) The fee for finalization of a provisional request shall be determined based on the  following principles:23  (i) Requests for finalization of provisional requests for registration of project  activities and PoAs are subject to the share of proceeds applicable to  requests for registration of projects and PoAs, respectively, under the Article  6.4 mechanism;  (ii) Requests for finalization of provisional inclusion of CPAs are subject to the  share of proceeds applicable to inclusion of CPs in a registered PoA under  the Article 6.4 mechanism;  (iii) Requests for finalization of provisional requests for issuance are subject to  the share of proceeds applicable to requests for issuance under the Article  6.4 mechanism;  (iv) All fees for requests for registration, issuance, renewal and post-registration  changes to project activities and PoAs as well as inclusion of CPs under the  Article 6.4 mechanism are waived for activities in least developed countries  and small island developing States. 7.

The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The CMA, at its sixth session, elaborated provisions of the RMPs relating to the  authorization of the use of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs) and  exemption from the share of proceeds for adaptation for least developed countries (LDCs)  and small island developing States (SIDS).4 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable  development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool) that provides means for  activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory requirements for  identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for assessing and  enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to sustainable development in line with  sustainable development objectives and priorities of the host Party and the sustainable  development goals. 5. The Supervisory Body, at its sixteenth meeting, adopted revisions to the “Standard: Article  6.4 activity standard for projects” (AS-P) which, among other things, included the relevant  requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. Additionally, the AS-P included new provisions allowing  activity participants to request a deviation through a DOE to the Supervisory Body prior to  submitting a request for registration or request for issuance if the DOE or the activity  participants identifies the presence of unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the  environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by  consultation or mitigation. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex.

If the host Party approves the project, the approval shall include:  (a) Confirmation that, and information on how, the project fosters sustainable  development in the host Party;  (b) Approval of any potential renewal of the crediting period, if the host Party intends  to allow the project to continue beyond the first crediting period, where the host  Party has specified that the crediting periods of A6.4 activities that it intends to host  may be renewed pursuant to paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs;9  (c) Explanation of how the project relates to the implementation of the host Party’s  NDC and how the expected GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  contribute to the host Party’s NDC and the purposes referred to in Article 6,  paragraph 1;  (d) Authorization of the activity participants;  (e) A statement on whether it chooses not to exempt the project from the share of  proceeds for adaptation (applicable if the host Party is a LDC or SIDS) in case it  has not specified it when submitting participation requirements. 25. Upon receipt of the response from the host Party, the secretariat shall inform the activity  participants of the response and publish it on the UNFCCC website. 4.5. Participating Party authorization of activity participants 26. Parties participating in the A6.4 project, other than the host Party (hereinafter referred to  as other participating Parties), shall through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC  website, provide an authorization of an activity participant any time after the publication of  the response from the host Party approving the project in accordance with paragraph 25  above but prior to the first transfer of issued A6.4ERs to the account of the activity  participant in the mechanism registry. 4.6. Preparation and validation of project design document 4.6.1. Project design document 27. The activity participants of a proposed A6.4 project shall complete a PDD in accordance  with the activity standard, taking into account the comments submitted during the local or  subnational stakeholder consultation conducted in accordance with the activity standard,  and the global stakeholder consultation conducted in accordance with section 4.3 above,  applying the same crediting period type and the start date of the crediting period indicated  in the draft PDD referred to in paragraph 19 above. 28. If the design of the proposed A6.4 project has undergone changes after the publication of  the PDD for global stakeholder consultation, the DOE shall determine whether these 9 See footnote 8 above.  11 of 54  A6.4-PROC-AC-002 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects Version 03.0  changes are significant. If the changes are determined by the DOE to be significant, the  DOE shall request the activity participants to make a revised PDD publicly available for  global stakeholder consultation. The DOE or the activity participant may seek guidance  from the Supervisory Body on whether a revised PDD shall be published for global  stakeholder consultation by submitting such a request in accordance with the “Procedure:  Direct communication with stakeholders”. 29. The Supervisory Body shall expeditiously consider the case, through electronic means  where possible, and provide guidance to the DOE and/or the activity participants. In doing  so, the Supervisory Body shall consider the significance of the changes in terms of the  impact on the application of the applied methodologies, the other methodological  regulatory documents and local stakeholders. 30. If the activity participants wish to deviate from the selected mechanism methodology when  applying it to the proposed A6.4 project, they shall, prior to the preparation of the PDD,  submit a request for clarification to the secretariat on whether such deviation is acceptable  in accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of baseline  and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. 31. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified by activity participants that exceed the  environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by  consultation or mitigation, activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE  as per the process for requesting a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD  Tool described in section 4.6.4 below. 4.6.2. Modalities of communication statement 32. The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 project shall designate one or more focal  point entities (hereinafter referred to as focal points) to communicate on their behalf with  the Supervisory Body and the secretariat within the defined scopes of authority referred to  in paragraph 34 below, and include this information in a modalities of communication  (MoC) statement using the “Modalities of communication statement form”. 33. After the submission of a request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project in  accordance with paragraph 67 below, all official communication between the activity  participants and the Supervisory Body or the secretariat for the project shall be conducted  in accordance with the MoC statement, with the exception of communications undertaken  in accordance with paragraphs 135 and 147(b) below. 34. The activity participants shall grant the focal points the authority to:  (a) Communicate in relation to requests for forwarding of A6.4ERs to individual  accounts of the activity participants (scope (a)); and/or  (b) Communicate in relation to changes to the MoC statement (scope (b)); and/or  (c) Communicate on all other project-related matters not covered by (a) or (b) above  (scope (c)).  12 of 54  A6.4-PROC-AC-002 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects Version 03.0 35. The activity participants may designate one or multiple entities for each scope of authority  in a sole, shared or joint focal point role.10 36. The activity participants and the focal points may designate one primary authorized  signatory and one alternate authorized signatory. The authentication of either the primary  or alternate authorized signatory shall suffice for authenticating the activity participant’s or  the focal point’s consent or instruction(s). If an entity serves as both an activity participant  and a focal point, the same signatory shall represent the entity in both roles. 37. The activity participants may voluntarily indicate in the MoC statement the end date of their  participation in the proposed A6.4 project. The secretariat shall monitor the end date of  participation and mark the activity participants as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website on  the day after the end date, provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the  host Party of the project remains. The activity participants whose participation in the  project has ended may request to be re-included as an activity participant in the same  project at any time thereafter in accordance with paragraph 152(a) below. 38. The secretariat shall, when conducting the completeness check of the request for  registration in accordance with paragraphs 75−77 below, consider the contact details  included in the MoC statement to be the valid contact details of the activity participants  whenever such details differ from the details of the activity participants and their  representatives included in the PDD of the proposed A6.4 project. 39. The secretariat shall publish non-confidential information included in the MoC statement  on the respective A6.4 project webpage of the UNFCCC website, following the registration  of the project under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 4.6.3.

Administration period 262. During the period from the effective date of deregistration of an A6.4 project until the date  that is three calendar years later:  (a) The secretariat shall communicate with the activity participants, the host Party and  other participating Parties in order to assist them to settle outstanding matters in  relation to the deregistered A6.4 project, including the completion of all issuance  requests and forwarding requests in respect of GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals achieved prior to the effective date of deregistration, and such other  steps as are necessary to ensure the completion of outstanding matters in relation  to the deregistered A6.4 project;  (b) Each activity participant may, after the effective date of deregistration, where  necessary, be treated as if it were still an activity participant by the Supervisory  Body and the secretariat for the purposes of the activity standard and this  procedure in order to allow the secretariat to process instructions relating to GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved prior to the effective date of  deregistration from such activity participant in relation to the deregistered A6.4  project. 12. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorization of  activity participant 12.1. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant 12.1.1. Submission of withdrawal notification 263. The host Party of a proposed or registered A6.4 project may, through its DNA, submit a  notification to the secretariat to withdraw the approval of the project or the authorization of  any of the activity participants made in accordance with paragraphs 23‒24 above any time  through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the following  information:  (a) The project title and its unique UNFCCC reference number;  (b) The type of withdrawal (either withdrawal of approval of project or withdrawal of  authorization of activity participants);  (c) The names of activity participants to whom the withdrawal of authorization applies  (if the withdrawal only relates to the authorization of activity participants);  (d) The effective date of the withdrawal, which shall be at least 60 days after the date  of the notification of the withdrawal unless the host Party specifies an earlier date  with justification;  (e) The reason(s) for the withdrawal. 264. Other participating Parties may withdraw the authorization of activity participants made in  accordance with paragraph 26 above, through their DNAs, any time through the dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the information listed in paragraph 263(a)−(e)  above.  48 of 54  A6.4-PROC-AC-002 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects Version 03.0 265. Upon receipt of the withdrawal notification, the secretariat shall promptly inform the  affected activity participants of the notification and check whether the information provided  is complete. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall request the DNAs of the Parties  submitting the withdrawal to provide the missing information. 266. The secretariat shall publish the withdrawal of the approval of the project and/or the  authorization of activity participants on the UNFCCC website on the effective date of the  withdrawal. 267. If the host Party withdraws the approval of the project:  (a) If the effective date of the withdrawal is before the DOE submits a request for  registration of the project in accordance with paragraph 67 above, such request  may not be submitted;  (b) If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the DOE has submitted of a request  for registration but before the final decision of the Supervisory Body on the request,  the request shall not be processed;  (c) If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the final decision of the Supervisory  Body to register the project, the provisions outlined in paragraph 268 below shall  apply. 12.1.2. Impact of withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant 268. For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party withdrew its approval, requests for  issuance of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project before  to the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline specified in  paragraph 177 above. Consequently, the A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with  sections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover a monitoring  period from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the project. 269. For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party or other participating Parties only  withdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project may still be  submitted until the deadline specified in paragraph 177 above. Consequently, the  A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity  participant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance  and distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn  shall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the project for the monitoring  period prior to the date of the withdrawal of the authorization. 13. Appeals and grievances 270. Stakeholders, the activity participants, the host Party and other participating Parties,  through their DNAs, may appeal decisions of the Supervisory Body or request that a  grievance be addressed in accordance with paragraphs 89, 103, 198 and 214 above and  the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”.  49 of 54  A6.4-PROC-AC-002 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects Version 03.0 Appendix 1.

The fee for a request for approval of post-registration change to a registered A6.4 project  (the post-registration change fee) shall be set at USD 1,500 per request. 11. If the post-registration change increases the scale of the project to bring the scale to a  higher tier of the registration fee, the difference between the paid registration fee  calculated in accordance with paragraph 6 above and the newly calculated fee shall be  paid in addition to the post-registration change fee. For any other post-registration  changes, any portion of the paid registration fee shall not be reimbursable.  51 of 54  A6.4-PROC-AC-002 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects Version 03.0 12. If the request for approval of post-registration change is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded  as incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body, the paid post-  registration fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:  (a) Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat  starts the completeness check stage in accordance with this procedure;  (b) No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the secretariat  starts the completeness check stage. 6. Issuance fee 13. The fee for a request for issuance of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs)  for a registered A6.4 project (the issuance fee) shall be a proportional levy to the amount  of A6.4ERs requested for issuance, set at USD 0.15 per A6.4ER requested for issuance. 14. If the request for issuance is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the  secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this procedure, the paid  issuance fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:  (a) Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat  starts the completeness check stage;  (b) Reimbursement of any amount above USD 1,500 if the request is withdrawn by  the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the completeness check  stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for issuance within the  timeframe referred to in paragraph 187 of the main part of this procedure;  (c) Reimbursement of any amount above USD 5,000 if the request is withdrawn by  the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the substantive check  stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for issuance within the  timeframe referred to in paragraph 190 of the main part of this procedure;  (d) Reimbursement of any amount above USD 10,000 if the request is withdrawn by  the DOE any time after the substantive check stage or rejected by the Supervisory  Body. 15. If, as a result of the substantive check by the secretariat or the review by the Supervisory  Body of the request for issuance, the quantity of A6.4ERs to be issued changed from that  in the initial request for issuance, the activity participants or the secretariat shall settle the  difference in the issuance fees if the difference is more than USD 300. 7. Renewal fee 16. The fee for a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project  (renewal fee) shall be at the same rate as the registration fee specified in paragraph 6  above, based on the scale of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals of the  project. 17. If the request for renewal of the crediting period is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as  incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this  procedure, the paid renewal fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the same  manner as referred to in paragraph 7 above.  52 of 54  A6.4-PROC-AC-002 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects Version 03.0 Appendix 2.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The CMA, at its sixth session, elaborated provisions of the RMPs relating to the  authorization of the use of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs) and  exemption from the share of proceeds for adaptation for least developed countries (LDCs)  and small island developing States (SIDS).4 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable  development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool) that provides means for  activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory requirements for  identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for assessing and  enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to sustainable development in line with  sustainable development objectives and priorities of the host Party and the sustainable  development goals. 5. The Supervisory Body, at its sixteenth meeting, adopted revisions to the “Standard: Article  6.4 activity standard for programme of activities” (AS-PoA) which, among other things,  included the relevant requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. Additionally, the AS-PoA included  new provisions allowing activity participants to request a deviation through a DOE to the  Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for registration or request for issuance if  the DOE or the activity participants identify the presence of unavoidable negative impacts  that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be  remediated by consultation or mitigation. 1.2. Objectives 6. The objective of the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”  (hereinafter referred to as this procedure) is to set out all procedural steps and 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

The CP inclusion notification shall include a summary of the CP, which shall contain, at  minimum:  (a) The title of the registered or proposed A6.4 PoA provided that the proposed PoA  has initiated the global stakeholder consultation process, in which the CP is  intended to be included;  (b) The title of the CP;  (c) The names of the activity participants; 13 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously. 14 The PoA-DD must have at least been published for global stakeholder consultation.  22 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  (d) The precise geographic location of the CP;  (e) A brief description of the technologies or measures to be deployed by the CP;  (f) The methodology to be applied by the specific A6.4 CP (if known);  (g) The actual or planned start date of the CP;  (h) The type (fixed or renewable), planned start date and duration of the crediting  period of the CP;  (i) The approximate amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  expected to be achieved by the CP in each year of the crediting period. 92. Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 91 above, if the start date of a proposed CP is  after 31 December 2020, prior to the date of entry into force of version 01.0 of this  procedure and after the start date of the first PoA period, the activity participants shall, if  they wish to seek inclusion of the CP in an A6.4 PoA already registered or planned to be  registered in the future, submit a CP inclusion notification through the dedicated interface  on the UNFCCC website referred to in paragraph 91 above within 180 days after the  publication of the respective PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation. 93. Once the secretariat confirms that the required information has been duly provided, it shall  promptly assign a unique reference number to the CP linked to the registered or planned  to be registered A6.4 PoA and publish the CP inclusion notification on the UNFCCC  website. 94. Upon publication of the CP inclusion notification on the UNFCCC website, the secretariat  shall inform the host Party of the receipt of the notification. 6.2. Preparation, validation, and inclusion of a component project 6.2.1. Preparation of the component project design document 95. To include a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA, activity participants shall submit a completed  component project design document (CP-DD) using the “Component project design  document form”. The submission of the CP-DD shall be made to any DOE accredited in  the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participant. Prior to  submission, activity participants shall ensure that the proposed CP complies with the  corresponding generic CP-DD in the latest version of the registered PoA-DD, including the  eligibility criteria for the inclusion of CPs in the PoA, and the relevant requirements outlined  in the activity standard and relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements. The  activity participants may submit multiple CP-DDs simultaneously. 96. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified by activity participants that exceed the  environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by  consultation or mitigation, activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE  as per the process for requesting a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD  Tool described in section 6.2.3 below. 6.2.2. Validation of component project design document 97. The DOE shall validate whether the project design complies with the relevant requirements  in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and  requirements based on the information provided in the CP-DD and any supporting  23 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  documentation it has received from the activity participants as well as further information  obtained during the validation activity. The DOE shall prepare a validation report, in  accordance with the validation and verification standard, using the “Validation report form  for inclusion of CPs”. 98. If the DOE or activity participants identify that the sum of the estimated annual GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the proposed CP  combined with the cumulative annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals expected to be achieved by all CPs that have already been included in the PoA  exceeds the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  approved by the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above, the CP shall not be included in  the PoA. However, the CPs may be included in the PoA if a post-registration change to  the PoA is approved by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraph 142(a)(iii) below, allowing  for an increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals expected to be achieved by the CPs to be included. 6.2.3. Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool 6.2.3.1. Submission of a request for deviation 99. The DOE may submit a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool to the  secretariat and seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a  deviation. Such deviation may be submitted when the activity participants prior to  validation or the DOE during validation have identified the presence of unavoidable  impacts that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria, and  that cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation. 100. To seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of the deviation, the  DOE shall submit a “Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool request  form” and additional documentation through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC  website. In the submission, the DOE shall provide:  (a) A clear and precise assessment of the case, based on evidence provided by the  activity participant as per the activity standard, including input from local  stakeholders if any;  (b) A description of the impact of the deviation on social, environmental and  sustainable development impacts from the proposed project;  (c) A draft CP-DD with a completed section A: Project description and Section E:  Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts  including its Appendices 6 (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form), 7 (A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form)  and/or 8 (A6.4 Sustainable development impact form). 6.2.3.2. Processing of request for deviation 101. The secretariat shall issue a statement of the deviation consideration fee due, or  confirmation that no fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions contained in  Appendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE. 102. The DOE shall communicate to the activity participants the deviation consideration fee  due, or a confirmation that no fee is due.  24 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 103. The activity participants shall pay the deviation consideration fee by bank transfer, quoting  the unique CP reference number referred to in paragraph 93 above, within 30 days of the  issuance to the DOE of the statement of the deviation consideration fee due. 104. The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website. 105. If the secretariat does not receive the deviation consideration fee by the 30-day deadline  referred to in paragraph 103 above, the request for deviation shall be deemed withdrawn.  The DOE may submit a new request for deviation of the same CP anytime thereafter,  following the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of  the new submission. 106. The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted requests for deviation  on the UNFCCC website for which the applicable fee has been received by the secretariat  or for which no fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly available the schedule of  processing the requests for deviation, including the expected date of commencement. The  secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of the requests for  deviation in accordance with the secretariat’s operational plans – that is, monthly quotas  – which shall also incorporate any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body. 107. The secretariat shall commence the processing of the request for deviation in accordance  with the schedule. The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check within seven days  to determine whether the request submission is complete in accordance with  paragraph 100 above. 108. If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or  inconsistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE, by email, to submit revised  documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the requested  documents and/or information within two days of receipt of the request. If the DOE does  not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat  shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless the DOE provides a  justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested documents and/or  information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly. 109. The secretariat shall notify the DOE of the conclusion of the completeness check. If the  request submission is found incomplete, the secretariat shall also communicate the  underlying reasons to the DOE and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website.  In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for deviation with revised documentation.  If the resubmission of the request for deviation is made within 28 days of the notification,  the secretariat shall promptly commence the completeness check again; otherwise the  resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for deviation. 110. Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall publish the  request for deviation on the UNFCCC website, and the request for deviation shall be  deemed received by the Supervisory Body for consideration. 111. Within 14 days of the date of publication of the request for deviation, the secretariat shall  prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for deviation  including a recommendation on the course of action, or with a notification that the case  will be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting. 112. If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require  clarifications from the DOE, it shall request the DOE to submit revised documents and/or  25 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  information to clarify the issues within 14 days of receipt of the request. If the DOE submits  the requested documents and/or information within the deadline, the secretariat,  notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 111 above, shall promptly finalize the  summary note and send it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of the  requested documents and/or information from the DOE. If the DOE does not submit the  requested documents and/or information by the deadline, the secretariat shall not process  the request submission any further. 113. If the request submission is removed from processing in accordance with paragraph 112  above, the DOE may request the secretariat, by email through a dedicated email address,  to make a telephone call or an internet-based call to the DOE to provide clarifications on  the issues identified if they are not clear enough to them. Only one such request shall be  allowed per request for deviation. In this case, the DOE shall provide the contact details  of the person to be called and the preferred time slots. The secretariat shall fix an  appointment for the call within three days of receipt of the request. The secretariat shall  record the call. 114. If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require  inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts, it shall send the case to an  appropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide inputs within seven days of receipt  of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall, notwithstanding the provisions in  paragraphs 111 and 112 above, finalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory  Body within 14 days of receipt of the inputs from the expert. 115. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the  course of action referred to in paragraph 111 above within 14 days of receipt of the  summary note, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision  adopted by the Supervisory Body. 116. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving the reasons in writing. The  secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the  Supervisory Body. 117. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the  course of action more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case  shall be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall  be placed on the agenda of the subsequent Supervisory Body meeting. 6.2.3.3. Finalizing a request for deviation 118. If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting in accordance with  paragraph 111 or 117 above, it shall decide on the course of action at the meeting. 119. The course of action shall be to:  (a) Approve the deviation and allow submission of a request for registration with the  deviation; or  (b) Reject the request. 120. Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  DOE of the decision, the reasons thereof and any guidance provided by the Supervisory  Body as applicable, and make the decision, reasons and guidance publicly available on  26 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  the UNFCCC website by publishing a ruling note within three days of the decision of the  Supervisory Body. 6.2.3.4. Withdrawal of a request for deviation 6.2.3.4.1. Submission of a request for withdrawal 121. For the following cases, the DOE shall submit a request for withdrawal of a request for  deviation to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website:  (a) The activity participants voluntarily wish for the request for deviation to be  withdrawn;15  (b) The DOE has new insights or information. 6.2.3.4.2. Processing of a request for withdrawal 122. Upon receipt of the request for withdrawal of a request for deviation, the secretariat shall  check the information provided as soon as possible. The secretariat shall reimburse the  deviation consideration fee, if applicable, in accordance with Appendix 1. If the withdrawal  occurs after the request for deviation is published in accordance with paragraph 110  above, the secretariat shall mark the deviation as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website. 6.2.4. Inclusion of component project 123. If the DOE confirms that the proposed CP complies with the requirements for inclusion of  CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above, it shall include the  specific CP in the PoA by uploading the corresponding CP-DD through a dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website together with the “Component project inclusion form”,  the validation report and a declaration that the development, implementation and  operation of the proposed CP do not involve any illegal activities, including money  laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery or other criminal activities. Such an upload shall be  made only after the registration of the PoA. 124. Once the documents referred to in paragraph 123 above are uploaded, the secretariat  shall automatically check, through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,  whether the inclusion of the CP would cause the total annual GHG emission reductions or  net removals for the registered A6.4 PoA to exceed the maximum amount approved by  the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above. If the total annual amount exceeds the  maximum annual amount approved by the host Party, the dedicated interface shall  automatically block the processing of the uploaded documents. Otherwise the secretariat  shall issue a statement of the CP inclusion fee due (or a confirmation that no CP inclusion  fee is due), determined in accordance with the provisions on the registration fee contained  in Appendix 1, and communicate it to the DOE. 125. The processes for payment of the CP inclusion fee by the activity participants and  submission of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of non-payment of  the CP inclusion fee within the deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions for the  registration fee contained in paragraphs 47-49 above, mutatis mutandis. 126. The CP described in the CP-DD, as uploaded by the DOE, will be included in the registered  A6.4 PoA and displayed on the activity view page of that PoA on the UNFCCC website 15 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously.  27 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  after the CP inclusion fee is processed. The secretariat shall automatically notify the DOE,  the activity participants and the DNA of the host Party of the CP of the change in status of  the PoA, and shall assess, on a sample basis, the inclusion of CPs in accordance with the  process referred to in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above, mutatis mutandis. 127. If the methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines applied to the  registered A6.4 PoA are put on hold or withdrawn for any reason other than their  consolidation into a new methodology, no new CPs shall be included in the PoA until the  PoA-DD is revised to be in line with the revised or new applicable methodologies,  methodological tools and/or standardized baselines in accordance with the process in  section 6.4 below. Any new CPs submitted before the put-on-hold or withdrawal of the  applied methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines, but for which  the proof of payment for the CP inclusion fee has not been received by the secretariat  within the timeline specified in paragraph 125 above shall not be included in the PoA. 6.2.5. Review of erroneous inclusion of component projects 128. If the DNA of any host Party, any other participating Party of a registered A6.4 PoA or a  member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body identifies information that may  disqualify the CP from inclusion in the PoA, they shall request a review of the inclusion of  the CP by notifying the secretariat within one year after the inclusion of the CP in the PoA,  or within 180 days after the first issuance of A6.4ERs for that CP, by submitting a  completed “Component project inclusion review form”. Such request for review shall be  related to issues associated with the compliance of the CP with the requirements for  inclusion of CPs in the PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above. 129. If the request is received from a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body,  the Chair of the Supervisory Body, in consultation with the secretariat, shall assess the  information referred to in paragraph 128 above and decide, within 14 days, whether to add  the request for review to the agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body. 130. If the Chair of the Supervisory Body decides not to add the request for review to the  agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  relevant Supervisory Body member or alternate member of the reasons for this decision. 131. If the Chair of the Supervisory Body decides to add the request for review to the agenda  of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body, or if the request for review of the inclusion of  the CP has been received from the DNA of any host Party or any other participating Party  of a registered PoA, the secretariat shall accordingly notify the activity participants, the  DOE referred to in paragraph 97 above (hereinafter referred to as validating DOE) and the  DNAs of all Parties involved in the A6.4 PoA. The activity participants and the validating  DOE shall provide initial comments on the request for review no later than 28 days from  the date of notification of the review. 132. If the request for review is added to the agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory  Body in accordance with paragraph 131 above, the Supervisory Body, taking into account  any comments received from the activity participants and the validating DOE, shall either:  (a) Confirm the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA; or  (b) Exclude the CP from the registered A6.4 PoA with immediate effect if it determines  that the CP was erroneously included in the PoA.  28 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 133. If the Supervisory Body determines that the consideration of a request for review as per  paragraph 131 above or of an issue identified by the secretariat on the basis of a sample  assessment as per paragraph 126 above that raises concerns regarding the processes  used to include CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA, the Supervisory Body shall initiate a full  review of all CPs included in the PoA. 134. If the Supervisory Body initiates the full review referred to in paragraph 133 above, it shall  request the secretariat to contract a DOE that has not performed validation, CP inclusion  or verification functions with regard to this registered A6.4 PoA, to review all the CPs that  have been included in the PoA in the one-year period or have had their first issuance in  the 180-day period preceding the request for review. The DOE shall submit a review report  to the secretariat within 30 days. 135. The Supervisory Body shall establish an assessment team to analyse the DOE’s review  report and provide findings and recommendations to the Supervisory Body within 14 days.  The assessment team may discuss the findings of the DOE’s review report and seek  comments from the activity participants and the validating DOE, as appropriate. Based on  this assessment, the assessment team shall make a finding as to whether:  (a) Any specific CPs were erroneously included in the registered A6.4 PoA;  (b) Compliance of each of the CPs reviewed with respect to the requirements for  inclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above  was adequately assessed by the validating DOE in accordance with the validation  and verification standard and other Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements  applicable at the time of inclusion. 136. The Supervisory Body shall consider both the DOE’s review report and the assessment  team’s findings at its next meeting for which the report and the findings have been made  available by the 14-day documentation deadline. 137. The Supervisory Body shall decide to exclude any specific CPs from the registered A6.4  PoA if it concludes that they have been erroneously included. 138. A CP that has been excluded after having been identified as erroneously included in the  registered A6.4 PoA may be re-included in the same or different registered A6.4 PoA or  registered as an A6.4 project. For re-inclusion in the same or different PoA, the relevant  requirements in the activity standard, the validation and verification standard and the  process in subsections 6.2.1–6.2.3 above shall apply. For registration as an A6.4 project,  the relevant requirements in the “Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard for projects” and  “Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standard for projects” and the relevant  process in the “Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for projects” shall apply. 139. Where, for any of the specific CPs excluded in accordance with paragraph 132(b) or 137  above, the Supervisory Body determines that the validating DOE failed to adequately  assess their compliance with the requirements for inclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4  PoA in accordance with the validation and verification standard, the DOE shall have its  performance evaluated according to the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of  designated operational entities” and the DOE shall acquire and transfer, within 30 days of  the exclusion of the CPAs, an amount of A6.4ERs equivalent to the amount of A6.4ERs  issued for the CPs as a result of the CPs having been included to the cancellation account  in the mechanism registry.  29 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 6.3. Continuous engagement of stakeholders 140. Any time after the registration of a PoA under the Article 6.4 mechanism, Parties,  stakeholders, and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations may submit comments in  English on the registered A6.4 PoA or any CP included therein to the secretariat through  a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website. The submitters of the comments shall  provide the name and contact details of the individual or organization on whose behalf the  comments are submitted. Comments from stakeholders shall:  (a) Be specific to the registered A6.4 PoA or any CP included therein;  (b) Relate to compliance with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and regulations. 141. The secretariat shall promptly make the comments that meet the requirements in  paragraph 140 above publicly available on the UNFCCC website where the PoA  information is displayed and inform the activity participants of the publication of the  comments. 6.4. Change to registered programme of activities 6.4.1. General requirements 142. If a change occurred or is expected to occur to a registered A6.4 PoA, such a change  (hereinafter referred to as post-registration change to the PoA) shall be approved by the  Supervisory Body in accordance with this section to maintain the registration status under  the Article 6.4 mechanism. The post-registration change to the PoA shall not affect the  CPs included until the renewal of the crediting period of the CPs, shall fall within the scope  of the following acceptable changes and shall meet the associated conditions, as specified  in the activity standard:  (a) Permanent changes:  (i) Corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of achieved  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (ii) Permanent changes to the description of how to develop the monitoring plan  for each CP as per the corresponding generic CP-DD as described in the  registered PoA-DD, or permanent deviation of monitoring from the applied  methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents;  (iii) Changes to the programme design;  (iv) Addition of a generic CP-DD;  (b) Changes due to a revision of a methodology, methodological tool and/or  standardized baselines applied by the generic CPs;  (c) Registration or coverage under, or overlap with other, crediting schemes, other  frameworks or environmental markets. 6.4.2. Update of documents and validation or verification 143. For any permanent changes referred to in paragraph 142(a) above, the activity  participants shall revise the PoA-DD to reflect these post-registration changes. The activity  30 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  participants shall submit the revised PoA-DD and any other supporting documentation to  a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity  participants to perform validation of the post-registration change to the PoA. In this context,  if the activity participants wish to appoint this DOE to submit the request for approval of  the post-registration change to the PoA under the issuance track referred to in  paragraph 146 below, the selection of a DOE shall follow the same rule referred to in  paragraph 202 below. 144. For the permanent change referred to in paragraph 142(b) above, the validity of the  version of the methodology or methodological tool and of standardized baselines applied  by generic CPs shall follow the rules contained, respectively, in the “Procedure:  Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and  the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized  baselines”. After the validity of the previous version of the methodology or methodological  tool and of the standardized baseline expires, the activity participants may submit a  request for post-registration change to the PoA by updating the PoA-DD including, inter  alia, updating the eligibility criteria for the inclusion of CPs in the PoA to be in line with the  revised methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines. However,  such revision to the PoA-DD is not required if the methodologies or methodological tools  are revised or withdrawn to be included in consolidated methodologies without being  placed on hold, unless otherwise indicated in the report of the Supervisory Body meeting  at which the Supervisory Body approved the revised or consolidated methodologies or  methodological tools. 145. The CPs that were included before the revision of the PoA-DD shall apply the latest  version of the PoA-DD only at the time of the renewal of their crediting periods. If the  activity participants do not wish to revise the PoA-DD to apply the revised version of the  methodology, no new CPs shall be included in the PoA. 6.4.3. Submission of a request for approval of a post-registration change 146. After validating that the post-registration changes to the PoA meet all applicable  requirements for post-registration changes in the activity standard by following the  applicable provisions of the validation and verification standard and other applicable  Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a request for  approval of post-registration change. The request for approval shall be submitted either  prior to submitting a request for issuance of A6.4ERs that are affected by the post-  registration change (prior-approval track), or together with a request for issuance of  A6.4ERs (issuance track). The choice of whether the DOE submits the request for  approval via the prior-approval track or the issuance track shall be at the discretion of the  activity participants, who may consider the indicative list of post-registration changes that  may be suitable for approval under the issuance track outlined in Appendix 2. 147. A request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA of the permanent changes  referred to in paragraph 142(a) above shall be submitted as follows, irrespective of  whether it is under the prior-approval track or the issuance track:  (a) At anytime for corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of  achieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (b) No later than the first issuance request for permanent changes to the description  of how to develop the monitoring plan for each CP as per the corresponding  generic CP-DD as described in the PoA-DD of the registered A6.4 PoA;  31 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  (c) No later than one year after the occurrence of the permanent changes to the  programme design. 148. A request for approval of a post-registration change to the PoA of the changes referred to  in paragraph 142(b) above may be submitted once the Supervisory Body adopts a revised  version of the methodology. No new CPs shall be included in the PoA after the end of the  validity period of the previous version of the methodology or methodological tool, until the  request for post-registration change to the PoA is approved by the Supervisory Body. 149. Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 142 above have occurred  or are expected to occur to the registered A6.4 PoA, the DOE shall, wherever possible,  combine such changes into one request for approval of post-registration change to the  PoA. 150. Under both the prior-approval track and the issuance track, the DOE shall submit a request  for approval of post-registration change to the PoA to the secretariat through a dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website, attaching:  (a) The revised PoA-DD (in both clean and track-change versions) or a monitoring  report, as applicable, and any supporting documentation, prepared by the activity  participants in accordance with the activity standard;  (b) The validation report on the post-registration change to the PoA prepared by the  DOE in accordance with the validation and verification standard. 151. The secretariat shall issue a statement of the post-registration change fee due, or  confirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with  the provisions on the post-registration change fee contained in Appendix 1, and shall  communicate it to the DOE. 152. The processes for payment of the post-registration change fee by the activity participants  and submission of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of no-payment  of the post-registration change fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding  provisions for the registration fee contained in paragraphs 47‒49 above, mutatis mutandis.  The secretariat shall publish the submitted request for post-registration change on the  UNFCCC website after receiving the proof of payment of the post-registration change fee. 6.4.4. Processing of request for approval of post-registration change 153. Any post-registration changes to the PoA that may result in an increase in the maximum  annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be  achieved by the PoA that was previously approved by the host Party in accordance with  paragraph 25(d) above shall be newly approved by the host Party. If the PoA has more  than one host Party, approval is required only from the Party(ies) relevant to the increase  in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  resulting from the post-registration change to the PoA. Upon receiving a request for such  approval of post-registration changes, the secretariat shall, immediately after publishing  the request on the UNFCCC website in accordance with paragraph 152 above, notify the  relevant host Party(ies) of the receipt of the request, and request them to respond with  regard to the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net  32 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  GHG removals within 60 days of the notification or in any longer timeframe to be indicated  by the host Party(ies), through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website by:  (a) Approving the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals relevant to the host Party resulting from the post-  registration change to the PoA, or  (b) Rejecting the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals relevant to the host Party resulting from the post-  registration change to the PoA. 154. The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the response from the relevant host Party(ies), inform  the activity participants and the DOE of the response and publish the response on the  UNFCCC website. 155.

The deviation shall be subsequently verified by a DOE for  requesting issuance for the monitoring period in accordance with sections 7.2 and 9.1  below. 162. For any of the permanent changes referred to in paragraph 160(b) above, the activity  participants shall:  (a) Revise the CP-DD, to reflect the post-registration change;  (b) Submit the revised CP-DD and any other supporting documentation to a DOE  accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity  participants to perform validation of the post-registration change;  (c) Revise the PoA-DD and obtain approval from both the host Party and the  Supervisory Body of the request for post-registration change to the PoA as per  sections 6.4.4−6.4.7 above. This applies in the case of any changes to the CP that  may result in exceeding the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by CPs that may be included in the  registered PoA, such as but not limited to:  (i) An increase of capacity leading to estimated GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals from all included CPs exceeding the maximum annual  34 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be  achieved by CPs that may be included in the registered PoA that was  originally approved by the host Party;16  (ii) The addition of a technology/measure, that either:  a. Results in estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  from all included CPs exceeding the maximum annual amount of  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be  achieved by CPs that may be included in the PoA approved by the  host Party,17 or  b. Does not comply with the eligible technologies/measures covered by  the registered PoA. 6.5.3. Submission of notification of post-registration change 163. After validating that the post-registration changes to the included CP meet all applicable  requirements for post-registration changes in the activity standard by following the  applicable provisions of the validation and verification standard and other applicable  Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a notification of post-  registration change to the included CP prior to submitting a request for issuance of  A6.4ERs for the PoA that are affected by the post-registration change. 164. A notification of post-registration change to the included CP of the permanent changes  referred to in paragraph 160(b) above shall be submitted:  (a) Any time for corrections that do not have a material impact on the calculation of  achieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (b) No later than the first issuance request for inclusion of a monitoring plan;  (c) No later than one year after the occurrence of the permanent changes to the  registered monitoring plan of the included CP, permanent deviation of monitoring  from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or other methodological  regulatory documents, or the permanent change to the project design. 165. Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 160 above have occurred  or are expected to occur to the included CP, the DOE shall, wherever possible, combine  such changes into one notification of post-registration change. 16 If the increase of capacity does not lead to estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  from all included CPs that exceeds the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals expected to be achieved by CPs, activity participants shall ensure that the additionality  of the CP still complies with the eligibility criteria on additionality in the registered PoA-DD. 17 Post-registration changes to the project design involving the addition of a technology/measure shall not  trigger a post-registration change to the programme design if the technology/measure is covered in the  eligibility criteria of the registered PoA and if the addition of the technology/measure in the CP does not  lead to exceeding the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  expected to be achieved by CP.  35 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 166. The DOE shall submit a notification of post-registration change to the included CP to the  secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, attaching:  (a) The revised CP-DD (in both clean and track-change versions) and any supporting  documentation, prepared by the activity participants in accordance with the activity  standard;  (b) The validation report on the post-registration change prepared by the DOE in  accordance with the validation and verification standard. 6.5.4. Processing of notification of post-registration change 167. The secretariat shall issue a statement of the post-registration change fee due, or  confirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with  the provisions for the post-registration change fee outlined in Appendix 1, and shall  communicate it to the DOE. 168. The processes for paying the post-registration change fee by the activity participants and  submitting a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequences of non-payment of the  post-registration change fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions  for the registration fee contained in paragraphs 47-49 above, mutatis mutandis. 169. The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted notifications of post-  registration changes to CPs on the UNFCCC website.

The secretariat may  provide information, subject to the confidentiality of such information, and/or administrative  assistance to the DNAs, upon request by the respective DNAs. 187. The secretariat, in its role as the mechanism registry administrator, may, after notifying  the focal points and the activity participants, temporarily put on hold the forwarding of  A6.4ERs for the registered A6.4 PoA for which the activity participants or the focal points  have communicated a case of insolvency and/or a dispute in relation to the MoC  statement, pending resolution of the issues resulting from insolvency or resolution of the  disputes. 188. The secretariat shall display, subject to confidentiality requirements, indicative information  related to the notifications to the secretariat of issues resulting from insolvency and/or of  disputes on the activity view page of the registered A6.4 PoA on the UNFCCC website,  only in cases where the forwarding of A6.4ERs has been temporarily put on hold pending  the resolution of the issues, in accordance with paragraph 187 above.  38 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 6.6.3. Changes of focal points 189. Activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA may change the designation of any of the  focal points for any reason and at any time by submitting a new MoC statement duly signed  by all activity participants, either through:  (a) The focal points for scope of authority (b); or  (b) Any of the activity participants, in cases of changes made to the MoC statement,  excluding its annexes. 190. For changing the designation of focal points in accordance with paragraph 189 above, the  submission shall be made as follows:  (a) A new MoC statement for changes related to the designation of focal points, with  the exception of changes affecting only contact details and authorized signatories;  (b) Annex 2 to the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication statement  form”, for changes related only to contact details and authorized signatories. 191. When a focal point who is not an activity participant is added to represent the activity  participants for any or all scopes of authority, the new MoC statement referred to in  paragraph 190(a) above shall be supported by written evidence of:  (a) The new focal point’s corporate identity, if applicable;  (b) The personal identity and employment status of the new focal point’s authorized  signatory(ies), including specimen signature(s). 192. The legal representative of a focal point for scope of authority (b) may submit a new  annex 2 to the MoC statement if the authorized signatory(ies) of the focal point concerned  is/are no longer available. 193. Any focal point of a registered A6.4 PoA may request a voluntary withdrawal from its role  as a focal point. Such a request shall cover all scopes of authority assumed by the focal  point. The voluntary withdrawal process shall follow the following steps:  (a) The withdrawing focal point shall, directly or through the focal point for scope (b),  submit a withdrawal request to the secretariat including:  (i) Annex 3 of the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication  statement form”;  (ii) Evidence of the written communication, sent by the withdrawing focal point  to all other focal points and activity participants, indicating its intention to  withdraw from its role as a focal point, and inviting the designation of a new  focal point for the scope(s) of authority from which the focal point is  withdrawing. Such written communications shall be made at least 30 days  prior to the submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.  (b) The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if it is found  complete, approve the withdrawal of the focal point. In doing so, the secretariat  may request clarification from the withdrawing focal point, or may contact any of  the other focal points or the activity participants to request additional clarifications;  39 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  (c) Upon approval of the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat shall publish the  new annex 3 of the MoC statement on the UNFCCC website. Additionally, the  secretariat shall communicate the approval of the withdrawal of the focal point and  its implications on the MoC to all remaining focal points and activity participants of  the PoA;  (d) The approved withdrawal of a focal point shall have no effect on other focal points,  except in cases where the withdrawn focal point was part of joint focal point roles.  In such cases, the remaining focal points shall continue to act in a sole or joint focal  point role, as appropriate. If no focal point remains for a specific scope of authority  after the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat shall promptly notify the  withdrawal to the remaining focal points for other scopes of authority, or to all  activity participants if no focal point remains. The activity participants shall  designate a new focal point for any scope of authority for which no focal point  remains in accordance with the provisions of this section, to enable further  engagement with the Supervisory Body and the secretariat. 6.6.4. Changes of activity participants 194. If the activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA have changed after the registration of  the PoA, the focal points for scope of authority (b) shall submit annex 2 of the MoC  statement for each of the following changes:  (a) Addition of an activity participant;  (b) Changes related to entity names or legal status;  (c) Withdrawal of an activity participant. If an activity participant has ceased operations  and is unable to sign annex 2 of the MoC statement, the submission shall be  accompanied by evidence of the cessation;  (d) Changes related only to contact details and authorized signatories;  (e) Addition, or change, of the end date of participation of an activity participant of the  PoA. 195. For the changes listed in paragraph 194(a) and (b) above, the secretariat shall notify the  DNA of the host Party or any other relevant Party participating in the A6.4 PoA of the  requested change through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website referred to in  paragraphs 24 and 28 above, and request them to respond whether to approve the  change. 196. An activity participant added to a registered A6.4 PoA shall accept the existing MoC  statement, or a new MoC statement if submitted simultaneously. 197. If persistent efforts to contact an activity participant has failed, the focal points for scope  of authority (b) may request the administrative withdrawal of the activity participant,  provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the DNA of the host Party  remains. The administrative withdrawal shall follow the following steps:  (a) The focal points for scope (b) shall submit:  (i) Annex 2 of the MoC statement, withdrawing the non-contactable activity  participant;  40 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  (ii) Evidence of written communication to the non-contactable activity participant  stating the intention to request administrative withdrawal, including a copy of  the communication sent to the DNA that authorized the activity participants  to participate in the PoA, that has been sent at least 15 days prior to the  submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.  (b) The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if it is found  complete, send an e-mail to the non-contactable activity participant, with a copy to  the authorizing DNA, asking whether the activity participant objects to the  administrative withdrawal and requesting to respond within 30 days. The  secretariat may also use other communication channels to establish contact with  the non-contactable activity participant;  (c) If neither the non-contactable activity participant nor the authorizing DNA object to  proceeding with the administrative withdrawal within 30 days of the electronic  communication made in accordance with subparagraph (b) above, the secretariat  shall mark the non-contactable activity participant as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC  website;  (d) If the non-contactable activity participant or the authorizing DNA objects to the  administrative withdrawal within the 30-day period mentioned in subparagraph (b)  above, the secretariat shall reject the request for withdrawal and may advise the  focal point for scope (b) on further actions;  (e) Activity participants whose participation in the PoA has been administratively  withdrawn may request to be included as activity participants of the same PoA any  time thereafter in accordance with 194(a) above. 198. Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs 197(b)−(e) above activity participants of a  registered A6.4 PoA may directly request the following, by submitting annex 2 of the MoC  statement:  (a) Their own voluntary withdrawal, provided that at least one activity participant  authorized by the DNA of any of the host Parties to participate in the PoA remains;  (b) Changes to their own names, legal statuses or contact details;  (c) Withdrawal of other activity participants of the same PoA based on their cessation  accompanied by documented evidence of the cessation;  (d) Administrative withdrawal of other activity participants of the same PoA who are  not contactable provided that the submission shall be accompanied by the written  evidence referred to in paragraph 197(a)(ii) above. 199.

Pre-issuance activities 7.1. Preparation of monitoring report 201. Activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA shall prepare for each monitoring period and  in accordance with the activity standard, using the “Monitoring report form for PoAs”. The  monitoring report shall be prepared as follows:  (a) A single monitoring report for all CPs implemented in a single host Party and  included in the PoA in a single batch (hereinafter referred to as single batch of  CPs); or  (b) Multiple separate monitoring reports for different batches of CPs, provided that  these batches of CPs have the same monitoring period and apply the same version  of the methodology (hereinafter referred to as multiple batches of CPs). For multi-  country PoAs, each of the batches of CPs shall include only CPs monitored in the  same host Party. 7.2. Verification of emission reductions or removals 202. Activity participants shall submit the monitoring report(s) and any other supporting  documentation to a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by  the activity participants to perform verification of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals. In this regard, the selection of the DOEs to perform the verification shall follow  the requirements below:  (a) A DOE that performed the validation for registration of the PoA shall not be  selected to perform the first verification for the PoA;  (b) A DOE that performed the validation for renewal of the PoA period shall not be  selected to perform the first verification for the PoA after the renewal of the PoA  period;  (c) A DOE that performed the validation for inclusion of a CP shall not be selected to  perform the first verification of the request for issuance involving that CP;  (d) A DOE that performed the validation for renewal of the crediting period of a CP  shall not be selected to perform the first verification of a request for issuance  involving that CP after the renewal of its the crediting period. 203. The DOE shall:  (a) Verify whether the implementation of the CPs, and the monitoring and calculation  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals comply with the relevant  requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4  mechanism rules and requirements. This verification shall be based on the  information provided in the monitoring report(s) and any supporting documentation  the DOE has received from the activity participants as well as further information  obtained during the verification activity; and  (b) Prepare a single verification and certification report for a single batch of CPs or  separate reports for each of the multiple batches of CPs, in accordance with the  validation and verification standard, using the “Verification and certification report  42 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  form for PoAs”. The DOE shall verify and certify for the entire monitoring period  covered by the monitoring report. 204. If the DOE or activity participants identify that the total amount of GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals requested for issuance, combined with the cumulative amount of  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals issued for the PoA would exceed the  maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by  the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above, a post-registration change to the PoA shall  be approved by the Supervisory Body prior to proceeding with the request for issuance, to  increase the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  expected to be achieved by the PoA. 205. For the purpose of the potential selection of the verification activity for the performance  assessment of the DOE in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”, the  DOE shall notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,  of the scheduled site inspection for the CPs included in the batch of the request for  issuance, which is to be conducted in accordance with the validation and verification  standard, no later than four weeks prior to the inspection. 8. Authorization of A6.4ERs 8.1. Submission of statement of authorization of A6.4ERs 206. The host Party shall provide a statement of authorization18 on the use of the A6.4ERs for  the PoA as early as possible but prior to the first issuance of A6.4ERs for the PoA.19 The  host Party shall provide such a statement, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC  website, by completing a form and selecting one of the following options as to whether the  host Party:  (a) Authorizes, in full or in part, the A6.4ERs to be issued for the PoA for use towards  achievement of NDCs and/or other international mitigation purposes pursuant to  decision 2/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 1(d) and (f);  (b) Does not authorize any A6.4ERs to be issued for the PoA for use towards  achievement of NDCs and/or other international mitigation purposes pursuant to  decision 2/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 1(d) and (f);  (c) Allows mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be issued for the PoA, while noting that  it may authorize the A6.4ERs at a later stage subject to the provisions referred to  in section 8.2 below and relevant provisions of the “Procedure: Article 6.4  mechanism registry”. 207.

If the host Party changes the authorization status of the use of A6.4ERs as per  paragraph 212 above after the issuance of the A6.4ERs, the mechanism registry 21 In accordance with paragraph 13, decision 6/CMA.6 the Supervisory Body will consider and determine  whether, based on its experience, there is a need to set a time limit, from the date of issuance to when  the host Party shall provide a statement of authorization, and report back in its annual report to the CMA. 22 Please see footnote 20.  45 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  administrator shall undertake the changes to the authorization status in accordance with  the applicable provisions of “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry”. 9. Issuance of Article 6.4 emission reductions 9.1. Request for issuance 9.1.1. Submission of request for issuance 217. The DOE shall submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs to the secretariat after verifying  that the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4  PoA during the monitoring period covered by the monitoring report comply with all  applicable requirements for implementation and monitoring in the activity standard and  any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and certifying the  quantity of A6.4ERs that may be requested for issuance. The request for issuance shall  be submitted through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, including the  reference to the notification of the timing of the site inspection made in accordance with  paragraph 205 above and attaching along with the following attachments:  (a) The monitoring report and any supporting documentation prepared by the activity  participants in accordance with paragraph 201 above and verified by the DOE in  accordance with paragraph 203 above;  (b) The verification and certification report prepared by the DOE in accordance with  paragraph 203 above. 218. Requests for issuance for a registered A6.4 PoA shall be submitted in chronological order  of the monitoring periods covered by separate monitoring reports and shall not have gaps  between successive monitoring periods. 219. A request for issuance for a registered A6.4 PoA for a given monitoring period may be  separated into multiple requests for issuance, with each request based on different  monitoring reports covering mutually exclusive batches of CPs and for the same  monitoring period prepared in accordance with the activity standard. In this case, a request  for issuance for a batch of CPs for a subsequent monitoring period can only be submitted  after the requests for issuance for all batches of CPs for the previous monitoring period  have been submitted. The compositions of CPs within multiple batches may vary for  different monitoring periods. 220. Each request for issuance shall indicate the verified and certified GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals achieved by each CP for each vintage year in which they  occurred. 221. Requests for issuance for GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals occurring in a  crediting period of a CP shall be submitted within two years after the end of that crediting  period of the CP.23 If a submission was made after this deadline, A6.4ERs shall no longer  be issued for the CP for that crediting period. 222. Once the documents referred to in paragraph 217 above are uploaded, the secretariat  shall automatically verify through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,  whether the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals claimed in the 23 The Supervisory Body may set a different deadline for removal projects in the future.  46 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  request for issuance will fall within the maximum annual amount of GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals for the registered PoA approved by the host Party in  accordance with paragraph 25(d) or 153(a) above. If the total annual amount exceeds the  maximum annual amount approved by the host Party, the dedicated interface shall  automatically block the processing of the uploaded documents. Otherwise, the secretariat  shall issue a statement of the issuance fee due (or confirmation that no issuance fee is  due), determined in accordance with the provisions on the issuance fee in Appendix 1,  and communicate it to the DOE. 223. The activity participants shall pay the issuance fee by bank transfer, quoting the unique  PoA reference number referred to in paragraph 18 above, within one year of the issuance  to the DOE of the statement of the issuance fee due. 224. The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website. 225. If the secretariat does not receive the deposit of the issuance fee by the one-year deadline  referred to in paragraph 223 above, the request for issuance shall be deemed withdrawn.  The same or a different DOE may submit a new request for issuance for the monitoring  period covered by the withdrawn request for issuance anytime thereafter, following the  applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of the new  submission. 226. If the DOE submits a request for approval of a post-registration change to the PoA together  with the request for issuance in accordance with paragraph 146 above, it shall also submit  the documentation and information listed in paragraph 150 above in addition to those  referred to in paragraph 217 above. 9.1.2. Processing of request for issuance 227. The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list on the UNFCCC website of all  submitted requests for issuance for which the applicable issuance fee has been received  by the secretariat or for which no issuance fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly  available the schedule and status of processing of each request for issuance. The  secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of requests for issuance  in accordance with its operational plans, which incorporate monthly quotas and any  relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body. 228. The secretariat shall commence the completeness check stage in accordance with the  established schedule. Within seven days of the commencement of the completeness  check stage, the secretariat shall, subject to guidance from the Supervisory Body, conduct  a completeness check to determine whether the request for issuance submission is  complete in accordance with the completeness check checklist for requests for issuance. 229. If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or  consistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity  participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall  submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the  request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this  deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request for issuance submission is  incomplete unless the DOE provides a justification, by this deadline, for not being able to  submit the requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall  be extended accordingly.  47 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 230.

If the request submission does not meet the requirements of  the completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons  to the activity participants and the DOE and make this information available on the  UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for issuance with  revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for issuance is made within 28  days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-commence the completeness  check; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for  issuance. 231. Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject  to guidance from the Supervisory Body, conduct a substantive check within 21 days in  accordance with the substantive checklist for requests for issuance. 232. If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or  missing basic information, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity  participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall  submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the  request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this  deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless  the DOE provides a justification, by this deadline, for not being able to submit the  requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be  extended accordingly. 233. The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the  substantive check stage. If the request for issuance submission for which the secretariat  conducted a substantive check does not meet the requirements of the substantive check,  the secretariat shall conclude that the request for issuance submission is incomplete and  communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants and the DOE and make  this information available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit  the request for issuance with revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request  for issuance is made within 28 days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-  commence the substantive check; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new  submission of a request for issuance. 234. Upon a positive conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall publish  the request for issuance on the UNFCCC website which shall be deemed received by the  Supervisory Body for consideration. 235. The secretariat shall notify the activity participants, the DNAs of the host Party(ies) and  other participating Parties, and the DOE that the Supervisory Body has received the  request for issuance for its consideration, that the secretariat has published the request  for issuance on the UNFCCC website, and of the deadline for requesting a review of the  request for issuance, as referred to in paragraph 237 below. 236.

Following the verification, the DOE may submit a  request for issuance for the changed monitoring period as a new submission. 10. Renewal of programme of activities and component  projects 10.1. General requirements 274. A crediting period is defined only at the CP level, for each CP individually. A registered  A6.4 PoA, as the framework, is to be renewed every five years (or every 15 years for a  PoA involving removals) for a maximum of three times, that is, a maximum of 20 years in  total (or 60 years for PoAs involving removals), by updating the PoA-DD in accordance  with the activity standard. 275. If the host Party has provided an approval of renewal of the PoA period and the renewal  of the crediting period of CPs at the time of the registration of the A6.4 PoA in accordance 24 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously.  53 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  with paragraph 25(b) above, the PoA period and the crediting periods of CPs may be  renewed in accordance with this section. 276. Renewal of the PoA period does not require a new approval from the host Party(ies) and  new authorization of activity participants from the host Party(ies) or other participating  Parties. 277. The new PoA period shall start on the day immediately after the expiration of the current  PoA period irrespective of the date when the renewal of the PoA period is approved by  the Supervisory Body. If the PoA period is deemed renewed after the start of the next PoA  period, the activity participants shall not include new CPs or renew the crediting periods  of existing CPs from the first day of the next PoA period until the last day before the PoA  period is deemed renewed. 278. The new crediting period of a CP shall start on the day immediately after the expiration of  the current crediting period of the CP irrespective of the date when the renewal of the  crediting period of the CP is deemed complete. 279. If the date when the renewal of the crediting period of a CP is deemed complete is after  the expiration of the current crediting period, and due to this delay or for any other reasons,  the monitoring temporarily does not comply with the monitoring plan in the updated CP-  DD, the activity participants may opt for a temporary deviation from the registered  monitoring plan of the CP in accordance with the process for post-registration changes  contained in section 6.5 above. 10.2. Request for renewal of programme of activities period 10.2.1. Update of programme of activities design document 280.

The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA may submit to the secretariat, through  the focal point for scope (c) referred to in paragraph 34 above, a request for voluntary  exclusion of an included CP from a registered A6.4 PoA through a dedicated interface on  the UNFCCC website, attaching written agreement of all implementers of the CP to the  voluntary exclusion using the “Component project voluntary exclusion form”. 11.2. Processing of request for voluntary exclusion 307. The secretariat shall, as soon as possible, and in any case striving to do so within five  days of receipt of the request for voluntary exclusion of an included CP, conduct a  completeness check of the request and attached written no-objections from all  implementers of the CP. 308. If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies missing information, it shall  request the activity participants to revise the request and/or submit revised written no-  objections, providing the missing information. In this case, the activity participants shall  revise the request and/or submit revised written no-objections through the dedicated  interface on the UNFCCC website. Upon receipt of the complete request and written no-  objections, the secretariat shall resume processing the request. 309. Upon conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall notify the activity  participants of the conclusion of the completeness check and publish the request for  voluntary exclusion on the UNFCCC website. The request for voluntary exclusion shall be  deemed received by the Supervisory Body. 310. The secretariat shall promptly inform the Supervisory Body of the receipt of the request  for voluntary exclusion and mark the CP as “excluded’’ on the UNFCCC website. 311. The secretariat shall inform the host Party(ies) and other participating Parties of the PoA  of the voluntary exclusion of the CP. 11.3. Effects of voluntary exclusion 312. The effective date of exclusion shall be the date when the secretariat received a complete  submission of the request for voluntary exclusion. 313. A DOE may submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs in accordance with section 9.1.1  above for the monitoring report covering the excluded CP for the period prior to the  effective date of exclusion. 314. A DOE shall not make any request for issuance for the monitoring report that covers the  excluded CP for the monitoring period, including any date that is on or after the effective  date of exclusion. The mechanism registry administrator shall not issue A6.4ERs for the  excluded CP for the period from the effective date of exclusion. 315. A CP that has been excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA may be registered as a new  A6.4 project under the Article 6.4 mechanism or included in another registered A6.4 PoA,  provided that its crediting period is limited to the crediting period under the original PoA.  58 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 316. The CP inclusion fee shall not be reimbursed for an excluded CP. 12. Withdrawal of approval of a programme of activities or  authorization of activity participant 12.1. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant 12.1.1. Submission of withdrawal notification 317. A host Party of a proposed or registered A6.4 PoA may, through its DNA, submit a  notification to the secretariat to withdraw approval of the PoA or the authorization of any  of the activity participants, made in accordance with paragraphs 24‒25 above, at any time  through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the following  information:  (a) The PoA title and its unique UNFCCC reference number;  (b) The type of withdrawal (either withdrawal of approval of the PoA or withdrawal of  authorization of activity participants);  (c) The names of the activity participants to whom the withdrawal of authorization  applies (if the withdrawal only relates to the authorization of activity participants);  (d) The effective date of the withdrawal, which shall be at least 60 days after the date  of the notification of the withdrawal unless the host Party specifies an earlier date  with justification;  (e) The reason(s) for the withdrawal. 318. Other participating Parties may withdraw the authorization of the activity participants made  in accordance with paragraph 28 above, through their DNAs, at any time through the  dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the information listed in  paragraph 317(a)−(e) above. 319. Upon receipt of the withdrawal notification, the secretariat shall promptly inform the  affected activity participants of the notification and check whether the information provided  is complete. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall request the DNAs of the Parties  submitting the withdrawal to provide the missing information. 320. The secretariat shall publish the withdrawal of the approval of the PoA and/or the  authorization of activity participants on the UNFCCC website on the effective date of the  withdrawal. 321. If any of the host Parties withdraws the approval of the PoA:  (a) If the effective date of the withdrawal is before the DOE submits a request for  registration of the PoA in accordance with paragraph 43 above, such a request  may not be submitted;  (b) If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the DOE has submitted a request for  registration of the PoA but before the final decision of the Supervisory Body on the  request, the request shall not be processed;  59 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0  (c) If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the final decision of the Supervisory  Body to register the PoA, the provisions outlined in paragraph 322 below shall  apply. 12.1.2. Impact of withdrawal of approval of PoA or authorized activity participant 322. For a registered A6.4 PoA from which any of the host Parties withdrew its approval,  requests for issuance for GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the  PoA before the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline  specified in paragraph 221 above. Consequently, the A6.4ERs may be issued in  accordance with sections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover  a monitoring period from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the PoA. 323. For a registered A6.4 PoA from which the host Parties or other participating Parties only  withdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the PoA may still be  submitted until the deadline specified in paragraph 221 above. Consequently, the  A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity  participant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance  and distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn  shall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the PoA for the monitoring period  prior to the effective date of the withdrawal of the authorization. 13. Appeals and grievances 324. Stakeholders, the activity participants, the host Party(ies) and other participating Parties,  through their DNAs, may appeal decisions of the Supervisory Body in accordance with  paragraphs 65, 78, 241 and 257 above or request that a grievance be addressed, in  accordance with the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4  mechanism”.  60 of 66  A6.4-PROC-AC-003 Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities Version 03.0 Appendix 1.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4).1 In accordance with the RMPs, a proposed or registered Article 6.4 activity  (A6.4 activity) as well as monitored greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or net  GHG removals achieved by an A6.4 activity shall be independently assessed by a  designated operational entity (DOE) against the requirement set out in the RMPs in order  for the activity to be registered or renewed under the Article 6.4, or Article 6, paragraph 4  emission reductions to be issued.2 2. Pursuant to the RMPs, the Supervisory Body is responsible for the accreditation of  operational entities as DOEs and the establishment of the requirements and process  necessary to operate the accreditation.3 The CMA, at its third session, requested the  Supervisory Body to review the accreditation standards and procedures of the clean  development mechanism (CDM) with a view to applying them with revisions, as  appropriate, for the Article 6.4 by the end of 2023, and expeditiously accredit operational  entities as DOEs.4 1.2. Objectives 3. The objective of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation” (hereinafter referred to as this  procedure) is to set forth concise and transparent rules for the process of the accreditation  of operational entities5 under the Article 6.4. 2. Scope 2.1. Scope and applicability 4. This procedure sets out the process to operationalize the accreditation of operational  entities. 5. This procedure contains the series of rules and actions that shall be followed and/or  undertaken by applicant entities (AEs) and DOEs to obtain or maintain accreditation, as  well as by the Supervisory Body and its support structure to conduct accreditation  assessments of whether AEs/DOEs comply with the Article 6.4 accreditation  requirements.6 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. Available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. 2 RMPs, paragraphs 46, 51 and 57. 3 RMPs, paragraphs 24(a)(i) and 24(b). 4 Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(d)‒(e). 5 In this procedure document, as in the standard document, the term “operational entity” includes both  applicant entity (AE) and designated operational entity (DOE). 6 The term “Article 6.4 accreditation requirements” is defined in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”.  5 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 2.2. Entry into force 6. Version 01.0 of this procedure is effective as of 31 March 2024. 3. Normative reference 7. The following documents are indispensable for the application of this procedure:  (a) “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”;  (b) “Procedure on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”;  (c) “Procedure for selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4  accreditation roster of experts”;  (d) “Forms used in the Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”. 4. Definitions 8. In addition to the definitions contained in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”, the  following terms apply in this procedure:  (a) “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;  (b) “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action  is recommended as particularly suitable;  (c) “May” is used to indicate what is permitted. 5. Basics of the Article 6.4 accreditation process 5.1. Actors in the Article 6.4 accreditation process and main functions 9. There are several actors involved in the Article 6.4 accreditation process, and the  responsibility of each is as follows:  (a) The Supervisory Body takes decisions on whether to:  (i) Accredit AEs as DOEs, maintain the accreditation of DOEs and reaccredit  DOEs;  (ii) Conduct spot-checks of DOEs;  (iii) Place DOEs “under observation”;  (iv) Suspend the accreditation of DOEs for some or all sectoral scopes;  (v) Withdraw the accreditation of DOEs for some or all sectoral scopes.  (b) The Article 6.4 Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP) serves as the technical panel  under the guidance of the Supervisory Body and, in accordance with its terms of  reference, considers the results of accreditation assessments of AEs/DOEs by  Article 6.4 assessment teams, provides recommendations to the Supervisory Body  on the accreditation status of, or related actions for, AEs/DOEs, and makes  decisions on areas defined as per this procedure. The AEP may consider cases  electronically or at its meetings;  6 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  (c) Article 6.4 assessment teams (ATs) conduct accreditation assessments of  AEs/DOEs in accordance with this procedure, the “Article 6.4 accreditation  standard” and under the guidance of the AEP, to evaluate whether AEs/DOEs  comply with the Article 6.4 accreditation requirements and submit assessment  reports to the AEP. ATs are selected from the accreditation roster of experts which  contain both external experts and secretariat staff;  (d) The secretariat supports the implementation of this procedure;  (e) AEs/DOEs apply for accreditation, extension of accreditation for additional sectoral  scopes and/or reaccreditation and undergo accreditation assessments to  demonstrate compliance with Article 6.4 accreditation requirements. 5.2. Scope and status of accreditation 10. The Article 6.4 accreditation is based on the validation and verification/certification  functions as well as on sectoral scopes of accreditation.7 An AE may apply for  accreditation for both validation and verification/certification functions in one or more  sectoral scopes. 11. The accreditation of a DOE is valid for five years from the date of the accreditation decision  by the Supervisory Body. 12. Accreditation is granted to an entity registered under applicable national laws,8 irrespective  of whether the entire organization or a part of it performs validation and/or  verification/certification functions. 13. Accreditation is granted for both validation and verification/certification functions together,  in one or more sectoral scopes. Likewise, if accreditation is suspended or withdrawn, it is  done so for both validation and verification/certification functions together, in one or more  sectoral scopes. 5.3. Objective and scope of accreditation assessments 14. The objective of an accreditation assessment of an AE/DOE is to assess and determine  whether the AE/DOE complies with Article 6.4 accreditation requirements. 15. If the validation and/or verification/certification functions are performed by a part of an  AE/DOE, and other parts of the AE/DOE are involved in other activities, these other  activities may be assessed as they may affect validation and/or verification/certification  activities, in particular with regard to independence and impartiality. 5.4. General modalities of accreditation assessments 16. The assessment of an AE for initial accreditation and of a DOE for reaccreditation  consists of the following main elements:  (a) Desk review of the application documentation submitted by the AE/DOE with a  view to identifying all missing or unclear information and having the AE/DOE gather  all necessary information and documentation, as a preparation for the on-site  assessment; 7 Sectoral scopes of accreditation are defined in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”. 8 Please refer to section 6 of the Article 6.4 accreditation standard for more details.  7 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  (b) On-site assessment to assess whether the documented systems of the AE/DOE,  and its competence and operational capability to perform validation and/or  verification/certification functions comply with the Article 6.4 accreditation  requirements. An on-site assessment shall take place at the central office of the  AE/DOE and may also take place at any other offices of the AE/DOE or outsourced  entities where the validation and/or verification/certification functions of the  AE/DOE are performed. For reaccreditation, the selection of these other offices will  be based on the results of previous assessments (regular on-site surveillances and  performance assessments) and the results of the implementation of the “Procedure  on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”. 17. If, after completion of an on-site assessment, the AE/DOE has demonstrated compliance  with all Article 6.4 accreditation requirements, accreditation or reaccreditation shall be  granted to the AE or the DOE, respectively, for both validation and verification/certification  functions and in the sectoral scopes in which the AE/DOE has demonstrated its  competence to perform its validation and verification/certification functions. 18. After the Supervisory Body has granted accreditation or reaccreditation, the DOE is  allowed to perform its validation and verification/certification functions in the accredited  sectoral scopes. 19. A DOE shall be subject to performance assessments during its accredited term. The  purpose of a performance assessment is to assess the implementation of the systems of  the DOE and its competence in an accredited sectoral scope through an assessment of a  specific validation or verification/certification activity. The number and types of  performance assessments for a DOE are set out in section 7.1 below. 20. A DOE shall be subject to two regular on-site surveillances, as referred to in section 8  below, during its accreditation term. The purpose of a regular on-site surveillance is to  verify whether the systems, competence and operational capability of the DOE continue  to meet Article 6.4 accreditation requirements over the accreditation term. A routine on-  site surveillance should take place at the central office of the DOE and may also include  any other offices of the DOE or its outsourced entities where the validation and/or  verification/certification functions of the DOE are performed. 21. The Supervisory Body may decide to conduct a spot-check of a DOE at any time during  the accreditation term of the DOE. In addition, the AEP may initiate a spot-check of a DOE  in accordance with the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational  entities”. The purpose of a spot-check is to assess whether a DOE still meets one or more  specific Article 6.4 accreditation requirements because of a specific concern brought up  to the Supervisory Body regarding the compliance of the DOE with Article 6.4 accreditation  requirements or because of inadequate performance of the DOE monitored through the  “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational entities”. A spot-check  may include a desk review, and/or an on-site assessment at any office of the DOE and  outsourced entities where the validation and/or verification/certification functions of the  DOE are performed, and/or an assessment at the site of the Article 6.4 project (A6.4  project) or programme of activities (A6.4 PoA) being validated or verified/certified.  8 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 22. For the planning of an assessment, the risk associated with the activities, locations and  personnel covered by the scope of accreditation shall be taken into account while  implementing the following provisions:9  (a) Selection of the number and types of offices, outsourced entities and validation  and verification/certification activity of the AE/DOE to be assessed during the  initiation stage of the assessment;  (b) Planning of activities to be assessed by ATs. 23. For the conduct of assessment, the standard person-days and the number of AT members  participating in the assessment are provided in Appendix 9 to this procedure, and the  standard on-site assessment method to be used by an AT to conduct on-site assessment.  Under special circumstances the secretariat may propose to deviate from the standard  assessment modalities, based on the risk associated with activities, locations and  personnel covered by the scope of accreditation, including:  (a) The number of experts on the assessment team, with a possibility to have a one-  person team;  (b) The number of days to be spent by the team on-site, with a possibility to have a  one-day assessment;  (c) The format of the assessment, with a possibility to have some or all of the  assessors working remotely through, for example, videoconferencing;  (d) The sites to be included in the assessment, with a possibility to visit only the non-  central offices during the regular surveillance assessment. 24. In the event of the deviation, as referred in paragraph 23 above, the time between  consecutive on-site assessments shall not exceed two years. Also, deviation shall not be  exercised for performance assessment as referred to in section 7 below. 25. If a significant number (e.g. more than 10) of non-conformities (NCs) are raised by the AT  in either the initial accreditation assessment, performance assessment, regular on-site  surveillance assessment, reaccreditation assessment or extension of accreditation for  additional sectoral scopes assessment, an additional five days may be allocated by the  secretariat to the time frames required for the AE/DOE and the AT, respectively, to  complete the required actions referred to in this procedure.10 26. Where accreditation assessments are conducted simultaneously, the following modalities  apply:  (a) If a regular on-site surveillance or the reaccreditation process is initiated while a  performance assessment is still underway, the outcomes of the performance  assessment should be taken into account in preparing the workplan for the regular  on-site surveillance or the reaccreditation process;  (b) The outcomes of all performance assessments, regular on-site surveillances and  any other accreditation assessments in the current accreditation term should be  taken into account in preparing the workplan for the reaccreditation process; 9 Please refer to section 4.3 of the Article 6.4 accreditation standard on the risks associated with validation  and verification/certification conducted by a DOE. 10 In this procedure, the number of days is to be considered as calendar days, unless specified otherwise.  9 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  (c) If a spot-check is initiated while a regular on-site surveillance or reaccreditation  process is underway or will start shortly, the regular on-site surveillance or  reaccreditation process should specify the issues that triggered the spot-check,  where possible. 27. Where there is evidence identified by the AT that a DOE intentionally provided false  information, intentionally omitted information that should have been provided, or  deliberately violated any accreditation requirement,11 the AT shall promptly submit a draft  assessment report to the AEP. In this case, the following steps shall follow:  (a) The AEP shall consider the case and decide whether to recommend that the  Supervisory Body suspend or withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, based on the  criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure. At this stage, the AEP may  request the DOE to provide information relating to the alleged conduct;  (b) If the AEP recommends that the Supervisory Body suspend or withdraw the  accreditation of the DOE, the secretariat shall inform the DOE of the  recommendation of the AEP. The DOE may request an independent review of the  AEP recommendation in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 5  to this procedure, and/or request a hearing before the Supervisory Body in  accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to this procedure. In these  cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in  accordance with paragraph 27(d) below shall take place only after the Supervisory  Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to this  procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken  place, as applicable;  (c) If the AEP decides not to recommend that the Supervisory Body suspend or  withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, the AT shall resume the accreditation  assessment;  (d) The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP, together  with the independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable,  and decide whether to suspend or withdraw the accreditation of the DOE in  accordance with provisions in section 13 or 14 below, respectively, and based on  the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure;  (e) If the Supervisory Body decides not to suspend or withdraw the accreditation of  the DOE, the AT shall resume the accreditation assessment. 28. Under exceptional circumstances, while considering the assessments conducted under  the sections 6–17 below, the AEP may recommend to the Supervisory Body supported by  proper justification that the Supervisory Body:  (a) Conduct an on-site assessment to verify the implementation of corrective actions,  including the modalities of such assessment (e.g. AT members, time frame);  (b) Submit any appropriate recommendation. The Supervisory Body shall consider  such a recommendation at its next meeting and decide on the course of action. 11 The terms “intentionally” and “deliberately” mean active or passive omission or violation, which cover the  situations of through an act or through failure to act, through active intent or though gross negligence or  negligent disregard.  10 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 29. The AEP may submit any appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory Body for failure  of a DOE to meet deadlines specified in the regulations and decisions of the Supervisory  Body or the AEP. Such recommendation shall be supported by a proper justification. The  Supervisory Body shall consider such recommendation at its next meeting and decide on  the course of action, including authorizing deviation from this procedure. 30. If the AT identifies any findings during an assessment, these findings shall be classified  NCs or major NCs. Any finding is an NC if it is a non-fulfilment of an accreditation  requirement of the Article 6.4. If a finding is not an NC, opportunities for improvement may  be raised by the AT and recorded in the final assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-  013). A major NC is an NC that affects the capability of the management system to achieve  the intended results, which may cover the following circumstances and trigger the  suspension or withdrawal as specified in Appendix 3 below:12  (a) If there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that  products or services will meet specified requirements;  (b) A number of NCs associated with the same requirement or issue could  demonstrate a systemic failure and thus constitute a major NC. 31. If the AT identifies a major NC, the AT shall promptly submit a draft assessment report to  the AEP. In this case, the AEP shall consider the case and decide whether to recommend  that the Supervisory Body place the DOE under observation or suspend the accreditation  of the DOE, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure. 32. Appendix 5 and Appendix 7 to this procedure provide AEs/DOEs with mechanisms to  request a review of AEP recommendations and AT raising NCs, respectively. 33. All documentation provided by an AE/DOE for an accreditation assessment shall be in  English. 34. The language to be used in any accreditation assessment shall be English. AEs/DOEs  may use interpretation/translation services where necessary to ensure effective  communication with ATs. 6. Initial accreditation 6.1. General 35. The process for initial accreditation comprises the following steps:  (a) Submission of an application for accreditation by an entity;  (b) Completeness check of the application documentation by the secretariat;  (c) Preparation of a workplan and appointment of an AT by the secretariat;  (d) Desk review by the AT of the documentation provided by the AE;  (e) On-site assessment by the AT at the central office of the AE and, as applicable, at  any other offices of the AE or outsourced entities where the AE validation and/or  verification/certification functions are to be performed; 12 ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015.  11 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  (f) Recommendation by the AEP to the Supervisory Body for accreditation or rejection  of application;  (g) Decision by the Supervisory Body for accreditation or rejection of application. 6.2. Application for accreditation 36. An entity that wishes to be accredited and designated as a DOE shall submit to the  secretariat a duly completed application form (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-001), a declaration  of all other offices of the entity or outsourced entities where the entity’s validation and  verification/certification functions are to be performed (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-002), and  all other documents specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure, and pay the application fee  specified in Appendix 9 to this procedure. 37. The application of an AE for accreditation shall be considered duly submitted when the  secretariat has received both the application documentation and the application fee. 38. The AE may voluntarily withdraw its application for accreditation by submitting a written  notification of withdrawal any time before the meeting of the Supervisory Body at which a  decision on the accreditation is due to be made in accordance with paragraph 79 below. 6.3. Completeness check 39. The secretariat shall start processing the application once it is considered duly submitted  in accordance with paragraph 37 above. 40. The secretariat shall undertake a completeness check of the application documentation.  If the documentation is found incomplete, the secretariat shall inform the AE of the missing  elements within seven days of the application being considered duly submitted.  Subsequent steps of the process shall only continue once all requested documentation  has been received by the secretariat. 41. The secretariat shall publish the name of the AE and the sectoral scopes applied for by  the AE on the UNFCCC Article 6.4 website for global stakeholder consultation promptly  after receiving all required documents from the AE. Parties, stakeholders13 and  UNFCCC-accredited observer organizations shall have 30 days to provide any comments  or information in respect of the AE to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the  UNFCCC Article 6.4 website (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-025). 6.4. Appointment of the AT and preparation of workplan 42. The secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents from the AE,  appoint an AT for the assessment, selecting its members from the roster of experts  established for the purpose of accreditation assessments (hereinafter referred to as the  Accreditation Roster of Experts) in accordance with relevant terms of references. The AT  shall consist of at least two members, including a team leader. The size of the AT may  vary depending on the size of the AE and the expected volume of validation and  verification/certification activities to be performed by the AE, the application  documentation and the sectoral scopes of accreditation applied for. 13 For the purpose of this procedure, all members of the public are considered to be stakeholders.  12 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 43. The secretariat shall inform the AE of the composition of the AT. The AE may object, in  writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of  conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. 44. If the AE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall, within five days  of receipt of the objection, consider modifying the composition of the AT. If the secretariat  considers the objection unjustified, or the AE does not object to the selection of any AT  member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 43 above, the composition of the  AT shall be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and  replaces a AT member, it shall inform the AE of the new AT member within the same five  days. After this, the same steps in paragraphs 43 and 44 above shall repeat until the  composition of the AT is deemed accepted. 45. Once the composition of the AT is deemed accepted, each AT member shall sign a  confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-  004). 46. The secretariat shall, within five days of the end of the global stakeholder consultation,  prepare a workplan (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-007) for the assessment, based on the  application documentation and the comments and information received during the global  stakeholder consultation in accordance with paragraph 41 above, and submit it to the AEP  for comments. The workplan shall identify whether additional assessments shall be  performed at offices other than the AE central office. The AEP may provide comments on  the workplan within five days of receipt of the workplan. The secretariat shall finalize the  workplan within five days of the deadline for commenting by the AEP. 47. The secretariat shall provide the AT with:  (a) All information related to the application, including the application documentation;  (b) The workplan for the assessment. 6.5. Assessment by the AT 6.5.1. Desk review 48. The AT shall undertake the desk review of the application documentation. 49. If the AT considers the information contained in the application documentation sufficient  and adequate for the assessment, it shall prepare and finalize a desk review report (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-008) and send it to the AE within 15 days of receipt of the documents  referred to in paragraph 47 above, and proceed with the on-site assessment in accordance  with paragraph 53 below. The AT shall not raise any NC at the stage of desk review. 50. If the AT considers that there is missing, unclear and/or inadequate information in the  application documentation, the AT shall prepare a draft desk review report and send it to  the AE within 15 days of receipt of the documents referred to in paragraph 47 above, and  request the AE to provide additional and/or amended documentation. 51. The AE shall provide the requested additional and/or amended documentation within  20 days of receipt of the draft desk review report. 52. No later than 30 days after sending the draft desk review report to the AE, the AT shall  prepare a final desk review report. If the AT, at the first round of the desk review stage,  considers the additional and/or amended documentation adequate, or the additional  13 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  and/or amended documentation inadequate, or there are still missing documents but they  can be assessed during the on-site assessment, the AT shall send it to the AE and  proceed with the on-site assessment in accordance with paragraph 53 below. If the AT, at  the second round of the deck review stage, considers that the additional and/or amended  documentation is not adequate or there are still missing documents and they need to be  addressed or submitted prior to the on-site assessment, the AT shall submit a final desk  review report to the AEP requesting to consider allowing the AT to conduct an additional  round of desk review for the AEP’s consideration at its next meeting. 6.5.2. On-site assessment 53. After the desk review, the AT shall conduct an on-site assessment covering all offices  identified in the workplan. If there is more than one office assessed, all office assessments  shall be compiled into one reporting, and the final decision on accreditation shall be made  based on the outcomes of all offices assessed. 54. The AT leader, taking into account the availability of the AT members and the AE and with  support from the secretariat, shall coordinate the dates and logistics for the on-site  assessment. The visit to the central office shall be conducted within 60 days of receipt of  the final desk review report by the AE. The visits to other offices or outsourced entities, if  any, shall be conducted after the visit to the central office as per the workplan. 55. If the AE is not available for the AT visit to the central office within the time frame referred  to in paragraph 54 above, the secretariat shall request the AE to reconfirm its interest in  proceeding with the application for accreditation and seek justification in writing or by email  for the delay, and the AE shall reply to the secretariat within seven days of its receipt. The  secretariat shall present the case to the AEP for its decision on whether to allow the delay  or recommend that the Supervisory Body reject the application. 56. The AT shall conduct the assessment at each office identified in the workplan. If the AT  identifies any NC, it shall prepare a non-conformity report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-012)  for each NC during the office visit. The AT shall provide the AE with objective evidence for  each NC raised. The AE shall have an opportunity to seek clarification from, and ask  questions of the AT on the NCs raised. 57. The AE shall provide a written acceptance of any NCs that it agrees with during the AT  office visit. 58. If the AE disagrees with any NCs raised by the AT, the AE may request a review of the  NCs by the AEP in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this  procedure. All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in this  section up to the step immediately before the preparation of a (draft) final assessment  report. For the NCs placed under review, if the AEP decides to maintain them in  accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be  addressed as per the provisions in this section and the AT shall prepare a (draft) final  assessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with  the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft)  final assessment report excluding the dropped NCs. 59. The AT shall prepare an on-site assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-011) and  make it available to the AE with non-conformity reports, as applicable, for information,  within 15 days of the completion of the visits to all the offices as per the workplan.  14 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 60. If the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the AE for comments at the same time  as the on-site assessment report. The AE shall have five days to provide comments on  the draft final assessment report. The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking  under consideration the comments of the AE, make it available to the AE for information,  and submit it together with the on-site assessment report to the AEP within five days of  the deadline for commenting by the AE. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance  with section 6.6 below. 61. If the AT has identified one or more NCs, the AE shall conduct a root-cause analysis, and  propose corrective actions for each agreed NC, including a time frame for implementation,  within 15 days of receipt of the on-site assessment report. 62. The AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis  and communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the AE within five days of receipt  of them. 63. If the AE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the  deadline referred to in paragraph 61 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report,  make it available to the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-  site assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The  AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 6.6 below. 64. If the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the AE with  explanations to such rejection. The AE shall have an additional seven days to propose  revised corrective actions. 65. The AT shall assess the revised proposed corrective actions within five days of their  receipt. 66. If the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the AE does not  propose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 64 above, the  AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to the AE for information,  and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity  reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance  with section 6.6 below. 67. If the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by  the AT, the AE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their  implementation to the AT within 60 days of their acceptance by the AT. 68. The AT shall assess the implementation of all the corrective actions within 10 days of  receipt of the evidence of implementation. 69. If the AE does not submit evidence of implementation by the deadline referred to in  paragraph 67 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to  the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment  report and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall  consider the case in accordance with section 6.6 below. 70. If the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the  implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft  final assessment report and make it available to the AE for comments within seven days  of the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions.  15 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 71. If the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the AE shall  have an additional 30 days to pursue implementation of the corrective actions and submit  further evidence to the AT. 72. The AT shall assess the further implementation of the corrective actions within 10 days of  receipt of the further evidence. Regardless of whether the AT still considers the  implementation of corrective actions unsatisfactory, or whether the AE has submitted  adequate further evidence of implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall  prepare a draft final assessment report and make it available to the AE for comments  within seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further implementation of  the corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further evidence, as applicable. 73. The AE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made  available to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the  AE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the  NCs. 74. The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments  provided by the AE, make it available to the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP  together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within five days of  the deadline for commenting by the AE. 6.6. Consideration by the AEP 75. The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or  more NCs remain open, it may provide one final opportunity to the AE to resolve the  remaining NCs in accordance with relevant provisions in the previous section of this  procedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment. 76. If the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it  shall recommend that the Supervisory Body accredit the AE for all sectoral scopes applied  for. 77. If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 75 above, as  applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend to the  Supervisory Body one of the following options:  (a) Accredit the AE only for some sectoral scopes applied for;  (b) Reject the application for accreditation. 78. The secretariat shall inform the AE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP  recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 77(a) and (b) above, the  AE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with  the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. In this case, the consideration  by the Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in accordance with paragraph 79  below shall take place only after the Supervisory Body has received the independent  review report referred to in Appendix 5 to this procedure and decided on the review case. 6.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 79.

If any of the required documents are not received by the secretariat by the  deadline referred to in paragraph 86 above, the secretariat shall send a reminder to the  DOE within seven days of the deadline. If any of the required documents are still not  received by the secretariat within seven days of sending the reminder, the secretariat shall  report the case to the AEP, and the AEP shall make a recommendation to the Supervisory  Body to place the DOE under observation. 7.4. Appointment of the AT 88. The secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents, including the  confirmation of the on-site inspection date from the DOE, appoint an AT for the  assessment, selecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts. The AT shall  consist of a team leader and an expert qualified in the sectoral scopes of the A6.4 project  or A6.4 PoA in the validation or verification/certification activity selected for the  performance assessment. The size of the AT may be reduced or increased to ensure that  the competence of the AT is maintained and that the AT may adequately observe the DOE  verification team during a performance assessment based on a verification/certification. 89. The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object,  in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of  conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest.  18 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 90. If the DOE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall consider  modifying the composition of the AT within five days of receipt of the objection. If the  secretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection  of any AT member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 89 above, the AT shall  be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and replaces a AT  member, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within the same five days. After  this, the same steps in paragraphs 89 and 90 above shall repeat until the composition of  the AT is deemed accepted. 91. Once the composition of the AT is deemed accepted, each AT member shall sign a  confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-  004). 92. The secretariat shall provide the AT with the documentation for the assessment referred  to in paragraph 86 above. 7.5. Assessment by the AT 93. The AT may request additional documents based on the initial review of the documentation  for the assessment within five days of receipt of the first set of documentation. The DOE  shall submit the requested additional documents within five days of receipt of the request. 94. A performance assessment on a validation and verification/certification activity shall be  based on the observation of the validation and verification carried out by the DOE team  during the on-site inspection at the project activity site(s) and the desk-review evaluation  of a draft validation and verification report and other documentary evidence submitted by  the DOE.15 Regarding the on-site inspection, the DOE shall, with the support of the  secretariat, coordinate the dates and logistics for the visit to the project activity site(s) by  its validation and verification team with the AT. The DOE shall submit to the AT a draft  validation and verification report, duly reviewed internally for its completeness and  adequacy, including Corrective Action Requests, Clarification Requests and/or Forward  Action Requests, within 45 days of the on-site inspection. 95. The AT shall conduct the assessment of the documentation, including any additional  documents that have been requested by the AT. 96. The AT shall, within 15 days of receipt of the documentation for the assessment, prepare  a draft performance assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-014 or A6.4-FORM-  ACCR-015, as applicable), containing findings including those of potential NCs, objective  evidence for each finding and a conclusion on whether the DOE conducted the validation  or verification/certification activity competently, and make it available to the DOE for  comments. 97. The DOE shall have five days to seek or provide clarification regarding the findings from  or to the AT. The DOE may also submit additional documents to support its clarification. 98. The AT shall raise an NC for each finding that the AT concludes to be an issue showing  non-compliance with an Article 6.4 accreditation requirement, prepare a non-conformity 15 In accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects” and the “Article 6.4  validation and verification standard for programmes of activities”, an on-site inspection by a DOE may  be exempted from certain verification/certification activities. If such verification/certification activity is  chosen for a performance assessment, the assessment may be based on the remote inspection and/or  the desk-review evaluation.  19 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  report for each NC, as applicable, finalize the performance assessment report, including  a conclusion on whether the DOE conducted the validation/verification activity  competently, and make them available to the DOE for information within five days of the  deadline for commenting by the DOE. 99.

If the DOE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the  deadline referred to in paragraph 144 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment  report, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with  the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the  deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 8.6 below. 147. If the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the DOE with  explanations to such rejection. The DOE shall have an additional seven days to propose  revised corrective actions. 148. The AT shall assess the revised proposed corrective actions within five days of receipt of  them. 149. If the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the DOE does not  propose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 147 above,  the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to the DOE for  25 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-  conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in  accordance with section 8.6 below. 150. If the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by  the AT, the DOE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their  implementation to the AT within 30 days of their acceptance by the AT. 151. The AT shall assess the implementation of all the corrective actions within 10 days of  receipt of the evidence of implementation. 152. If the DOE does not submit evidence of implementation by the deadline referred to in  paragraph 150 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to  the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment  report and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall  consider the case in accordance with section 8.6 below. 153. If the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the  implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft  final assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments within seven days  of the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions. 154. If the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the DOE  shall have an additional 15 days to pursue implementation of the corrective actions and  submit further evidence to the AT. 155. The AT shall assess the further implementation of the corrective actions within 10 days of  receipt of the further evidence. Regardless of whether the AT still considers the  implementation of corrective actions unsatisfactory, or whether the DOE has submitted  adequate further evidence of implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall  prepare a draft final assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments  within seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further implementation of  the corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further evidence, as applicable. 156. The DOE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made  available to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the  DOE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the  NCs. 157. The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments  provided by the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the  AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within five  days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. 8.6. Consideration by the AEP 158. The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or  more NCs remain open, it may provide one final opportunity to the DOE to resolve the  remaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in the previous section of this  procedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment.  26 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 159. If the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it  shall inform the Supervisory Body of the successful completion of the regular on-site  surveillance. 160. If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 158 above,  as applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend to the  Supervisory Body, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure, one of  the following options:  (a) Place the DOE under observation;  (b) Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes. 161. The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP  recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 160(a) and (b) above, the  DOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with  the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation is  the option referred to in paragraph 160(b) above, the DOE may also request a hearing  before the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to  this procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP  recommendation in accordance with paragraph 162 below shall take place only after the  Supervisory Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to  this procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken place,  as applicable. 8.7.

If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 173 above,  as applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend to the  Supervisory Body one of the following options:  (a) Re-accredit the DOE only for some sectoral scopes applied for;  (b) Temporarily extend the accreditation of the DOE and, based on the criteria  contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure:  (i) Place the DOE under observation; or  (ii) Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for all sectoral scopes;  (c) Reject the application for reaccreditation. 176. The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP  recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 175(a), (b) and (c) above,  the DOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance  with the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation  is one of the options referred to in paragraph 175(b)(ii) and (c) above, the DOE may also  request a hearing before the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions  contained in Appendix 8 to this procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the  Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in accordance with paragraph 177 below  shall take place only after the Supervisory Body has received the independent review  report referred to in Appendix 5 to this procedure and decided on the review case, and  only after the hearing has taken place, as applicable. 9.4. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 177. The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the  independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, and decide on  one of the following options:  (a) Re-accredit the DOE for all sectoral scopes applied for;  (b) Re-accredit the DOE only for some sectoral scopes applied for;  (c) Temporarily extend the accreditation of the DOE and based on the criteria  contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure:  (i) Place the DOE under observation; or  (ii) Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for all sectoral scopes;  (d) Reject the application for reaccreditation. 178. The conditions of under-observation status and suspension of accreditation are given in  Appendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and lifting an under-observation  status and a suspension of accreditation are defined in section 12 and section 13 below,  respectively.  29 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 179. If the Supervisory Body decides to re-accredit the DOE, the secretary of the Supervisory  Body shall issue an accreditation certificate to the DOE. The new accreditation term shall  be valid for five years from the date of expiry of the previous accreditation term. 180. The secretariat shall promptly update the status of the DOE on the public list of DOEs  referred to in paragraph 81 above. 10. Accreditation for additional sectoral scopes 181. A DOE may apply for accreditation for additional sectoral scopes at any time within its  accreditation term. 182. The AEP shall consider the application and decide on the scope of the assessment, taking  into account the sectoral scopes for which the DOE is currently accredited, and the  additional sectoral scopes applied for. 183. The provisions and timelines defined in sections 6.3–6.7 above regarding the  completeness check, appointment of a AT, preparation of a workplan, desk review, on-  site assessment, and consideration by the AEP and the Supervisory Body shall apply  mutatis mutandis, except for:  (a) Publication of the name of the DOE and the additional sectoral scopes applied for  global stakeholder consultation, which is not necessary;  (b) The time frame for implementing corrective actions referred to in paragraph 67  above, which shall be 30 days instead of 60 days;  (c) The additional time frame for pursuing the implementation of corrective actions  referred to in paragraph 71 above, which shall be 15 days instead of 30 days. 184. An accreditation for a maximum of three additional sectoral scopes may be granted based  on an assessment performed and consideration given in accordance with sections 6.5–  6.7 above but without conducting any site visit. 185. The accreditation for additional sectoral scopes of a DOE shall be valid only until the expiry  of the existing accreditation term of the DOE. It is noted that the application of additional  sectoral scope can also be applied along with the application of reaccreditation as referred  in to paragraph 166 above. 11. Spot-check 11.1. Initiation 186. The Supervisory Body may decide to conduct a spot-check of a DOE at any time during  its accreditation term. 187. The consideration by the Supervisory Body to conduct a spot-check of a DOE may be  triggered by, inter alia:  (a) The review process conducted by the Supervisory Body on a request for  registration or a request for issuance submitted by the DOE;  (b) Information received from a third party on the possible inadequate performance of  the DOE in its validation or verification/certification activities as well as on any  changes which may significantly impair the compliance of the DOE with Article 6.4  30 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  accreditation requirements, such as changes in ownership, organizational  structure, internal policies and procedures, resources and personnel;  (c) A recommendation of the AEP based on, inter alia, the result of handling  complaints against the DOE in accordance with Appendix 6 to this procedure. 188. The reason that triggered a spot-check shall remain confidential. 189. The Supervisory Body may decide to immediately suspend the accreditation of the DOE  under a spot-check. If the Supervisory Body decides to do so, it shall provide the DOE  with an opportunity for a hearing at a Supervisory Body meeting prior to suspending the  accreditation. Also in this case, the assessment for lifting the suspension in accordance  with section 13 below shall not be initiated until and unless the Supervisory Body decides  to continue the suspension based on the outcome of the spot-check conducted in  accordance with the present section. 190. The Supervisory Body, once it has decided to conduct a spot-check, shall agree on the  scope of the spot-check. For this purpose, if the AEP recommends that the Supervisory  Body conduct a spot-check, it shall also propose the scope of the spot-check. 191. The AEP shall initiate a spot-check of a DOE if its performance on validation or  verification/certification activities as monitored through the implementation of the  “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational entities” declines, as the  final version of a monitoring report prepared in accordance with the procedure shows that  the DOE is in the red zone for the indicators I2 or I3. 192. Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 191 above, the AEP may not initiate a spot-  check of a DOE that has reached the red zone of indicators I2 or I3 if the following two  conditions are met:  (a) The issues in the scope of the spot-check have been covered and resolved in  recent assessments;  (b) A visit to the central office of the DOE under a regular on-site surveillance or  reaccreditation assessment is planned to take place in the next 90 days; in such  case, the issues envisaged for the spot-check shall be considered and addressed  in the regular surveillance or reaccreditation assessment. 193. If the AEP initiates a spot-check of a DOE in accordance with paragraph 191 above, it  shall agree on the scope of the spot-check and inform the Supervisory Body of the initiation  of the spot-check and the scope. The scope shall be based on the information gathered  in the implementation of the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated  operational entities”. 194. The scope of a spot-check shall include the following:  (a) Identification of the type and the site of the spot-check, such as:  (i) On-site assessment at the central office of the DOE and/or any other offices  of the DOE or outsourced entities where the DOE validation or  verification/certification functions are performed;  (ii) On-site assessment at an A6.4 project or A6.4 PoA site regarding which the  DOE performed a validation or verification/certification;  (iii) Off-site document review;  31 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  (b) Specific aspects to be focused on during the spot-check, such as:  (i) Management personnel of the DOE and its validation and  verification/certification personnel in relation to its competence to perform  validation and verification/certification functions;  (ii) Organizational and management structure of the DOE, in particular for  providing validation and verification/certification services in an independent  and impartial manner;  (iii) Any other area identified as relevant to verify the compliance of the DOE with  Article 6.4 accreditation requirements. 195. The name of the DOE under spot-check shall be made public in the report of the  Supervisory Body meeting at which the Supervisory Body decided to conduct the spot-  check or was informed by the AEP of the initiation of the spot-check. 11.2. Appointment of the AT and preparation of workplan 196. The secretariat shall, within five days of the Supervisory Body’s decision to conduct the  spot-check in accordance with paragraph 186 above, or the initiation of the spot-check by  the AEP in accordance with paragraph 191 above, appoint an AT for the spot-check,  selecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts. The AT shall consist of at  least two members, including a team leader. The size of the AT may vary depending on  the nature of the issue that triggered the spot-check. 197. The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object,  in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of  conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. 198. If the DOE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall consider  modifying the composition of the AT within five days of receipt of the objection. If the  secretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection  of any AT member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 197 above, the AT shall  be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and replaces an  AT member, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within the same five days.  After this, the same steps in paragraphs 197 above and 198 shall repeat until the  composition of the AT is deemed accepted. 199. Once the composition of the AT is deemed accepted, each AT member shall sign a  confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-  004). 200. The secretariat shall, within five days of the Supervisory Body’s decision to conduct the  spot-check in accordance with paragraph 186 above, or the initiation of the spot-check by  the AEP in accordance with paragraph 191 above, prepare a workplan (form A6.4-FORM-  ACCR-007) for the spot-check and submit it to the AEP for comments, based on the scope  defined by the Supervisory Body or the AEP, as applicable. The AEP may provide  comments on the workplan within five days of receipt of the workplan. The secretariat shall  finalize the workplan within five days of the deadline for commenting by the AEP. 201. The secretariat shall provide the AT with:  (a) All relevant information on the areas to be assessed;  32 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  (b) The workplan for the assessment. 202. If the spot-check is to be conducted at an Article 6.4 project activity or PoA site, the  secretariat shall:  (a) Send a notification to the DOE and respective activity participants before the spot-  check;  (b) Request the DOE to coordinate necessary arrangements with activity participants. 11.3. Assessment by the AT 203. The AT shall review the documentation provided by the secretariat and prepare an  assessment plan taking into account the scope of the spot-check. 204. After the completion of its assessment, the AT shall prepare a draft spot-check report  using the relevant accreditation assessment form and non-conformity reports, as  applicable, and make them available to the DOE for comments within seven days. 205. The DOE shall have five days to provide comments on the draft spot-check report and the  non-conformity reports, as applicable. 206. The AT shall finalize the spot-check report within five days of the deadline for commenting  by the DOE and submit it to the AEP together with the non-conformity reports, as  applicable. 11.4. Consideration by the AEP 207. The AEP shall consider the spot-check reports, the non-conformity reports, as applicable,  and the comments provided by the DOE, and, based on the criteria contained in Appendix  3 to this procedure, shall recommend to the Supervisory Body one of the following options:  (a) Confirm the accreditation of the DOE for all accredited sectoral scopes;  (b) Request the DOE to identify and implement corrective actions to address the  identified NCs within a specified time frame. The implemented corrective actions  shall be verified by the AT through a site visit or an off-site document review, as  appropriate;  (c) Place the DOE under observation;  (d) Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes;  (e) Withdraw the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes. 208.

An “adverse recommendation” is a recommendation by the Article 6.4 Accreditation Panel  (AEP) to the Supervisory Body that, if adopted as a decision by the Supervisory Body  pursuant to this procedure, would affect the accreditation status of a designated  operational entity (DOE) or constitute an obstacle to maintaining or extending  accreditation by DOE, or to obtaining accreditation by an applicant entity (AE), made in  accordance with the relevant provisions of this procedure. 2. A “request for independent review” means a request from an AE or DOE to the Supervisory  Body to appoint an independent panel of experts to conduct a review of an adverse  recommendation where the AE/DOE considers the adverse recommendation to be in  breach of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard” and/or this procedure. 2. Submission of a request for independent review 3. An AE/DOE may submit to the secretariat a request for independent review of an adverse  recommendation of the AEP, using the relevant form (A6.4-FORM-ACCR-016), within  seven days of being informed of the adverse recommendation. The submission shall  include evidence of the payment of the fee referred to in paragraph 5 of this appendix. 4. The AE/DOE shall specify the particular provisions of the “Article 6.4 accreditation  standard” and/or this procedure that it considers the adverse recommendation breaches  and shall provide justification and evidence to support its view. 5. A fee of USD 2,000 shall be payable by the AE/DOE upon submission of the request. 3. Completeness check of the request for independent review 6. Upon receipt of the request for independent review, the secretariat shall acknowledge the  receipt promptly. 7. The secretariat shall, within seven days of receipt of the request for independent review,  undertake a completeness check to confirm that the request for independent review has  been duly submitted and includes all relevant documents to carry out a preliminary  assessment, including evidence of payment of the fee. The secretariat may request the  AE/DOE to submit further relevant information. The AE/DOE shall submit such information  within seven days or explain why such information cannot be submitted. If no response is  received from the AE/DOE within this time frame, the secretariat shall cease the  completeness check and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request for independent  review. 4. Preliminary assessment of the request for independent review 8. The secretariat, after receipt of the request for independent review or further information  or explanation if requested in accordance with paragraph 7 of this appendix, shall carry  out and conclude a preliminary assessment of the request for independent review within  10 days.  52 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2 9.

If the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for independent review meets all  the conditions referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall inform the  AEP and the Supervisory Body of the request for independent review. 5. Assessment of the request for independent review 12. The secretariat shall, within five days of successful conclusion of the preliminary  assessment, provide the AEP and the Supervisory Body with the request for independent  review and all supporting documentation received from the AE/DOE or prepared by the  secretariat. 13. The secretariat shall, within the same five days of successful conclusion of the preliminary  assessment, also prepare a list of five experts, selecting from the Accreditation Roster of  Experts, the Methodologies Roster of Experts or the Registration and Issuance Team, as  candidates for an independent panel to conduct an independent review of the adverse  recommendation, and send the list to the AE/DOE. 14. The AE/DOE may object, in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any  expert on the list on the basis of conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. 15. If the AE/DOE objects to the selection of an expert, the secretariat shall, within five days,  consider modifying the list of experts. If the secretariat considers the objection unjustified,  or the AE/DOE does not object to the selection of any expert within the time frame referred  to in paragraph 14 of this appendix, the list of experts shall be deemed accepted. If the  secretariat considers the objection justified and modifies the list of experts, it shall send  the modified list to the AE/DOE within the same five days.

For initial accreditation and reaccreditation, if an AE/DOE notifies the secretariat of the  following changes in its application before all appointed AT members sign a confidentiality  agreement and conflict of interest declaration, no additional fee shall be charged to the  AE/DOE. If the AE/DOE notifies the secretariat of the changes after all appointed AT  members have signed a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement but before the  coordination of the on-site assessment, an additional fee of two person-days for the AT  leader shall be charged to the AE/DOE for the leader undertaking an additional desk  review. If the AE/DOE notifies the secretariat of the changes after the coordination of the  on-site assessment, the case shall be considered as a new application and the AE/DOE  shall pay another application fee referred to in paragraph 1 of this appendix:  (a) Addition to the list of sectoral scopes applied for;  (b) Substantial changes in documentation. 8. The AT members shall send the original receipts of fee payment signed by respective AT  members to the AE/DOE and submit an electronic copy of them to the secretariat.  65 of 66  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.2  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.2 5 June 2024 Editorial revision to correct paragraph numbering from para. 94  onwards and to include the form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-025.  01.1 27 May 2024 Editorial revision to align the abbreviations of AEP and ATs, as  well as the symbol numbers of accreditation-related forms.  01.0 2 November 2023 SB 008, Annex 12.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement, at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) for the  mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the Article 6.4  mechanism).1 In accordance with the RMPs, a proposed or registered Article 6.4 activity  (A6.4 activity) as well as monitored greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or net  GHG removals achieved by an A6.4 activity shall be independently assessed by a  designated operational entity (DOE) against the requirement set out in the RMPs in order  for the activity to be registered or renewed under Article 6.4 mechanism, or for Article 6,  paragraph 4, emission reductions to be issued.2 2. DOEs play a vital role under the Article 6.4 mechanism by performing validation and  verification/certification functions, and the impartiality and competence of DOEs are  ensured through the application of the “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation” and the  “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”. With the application of the “Procedure: Performance  monitoring of the Article 4.6 designated operational entities”, specific measures  (e.g. increasing the number of performance assessments, defining the focused areas to  be assessed in the central office and/or non-central offices in the forthcoming regular on-  site surveillance, and initiating spot-checks) can be initiated based on the results of the  performance monitoring of DOEs. 1.2. Objective 3. The objective of the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated  operational entities” (herein after referred to as “this procedure”) is to:  (a) Set out the process and requirements to monitor the performance of, and address  non-compliance by, DOEs in a systematic manner;  (b) Foster the improvement of the performance of DOEs and provide the Supervisory  Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism and the Article 6.4 mechanism Accreditation  Expert Panel (AEP) with tools for informed decision-making on actions in the  accreditation process;  (c) Foster system-wide improvements via identification of issues where guidance or  requirements lack clarity or are non-existent. 2. Scope 2.1. Scope 4. This procedure monitors the performance of DOEs through the monitoring, classification  and rating of instances of non-compliance identified in the requests for registration and 1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. Available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. 2  RMPs, paragraphs 46, 51 and 57.  4 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0  issuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs); requests for  renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;  requests for inclusion of A6.4 component projects (CPs)3; request for renewal of A6.4  CPs;4 and requests for approval of post-registration changes (PRCs) of A6.4 projects,  A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track submitted by DOEs.5 It provides  for the monitoring, classification and categorization of instances of non-compliance into  pre-defined subcategories and assigns weight to be used for classifying and grading  instances of non-compliances. It establishes a rating system for all DOEs’ instances of  non-compliance, comparing the indicators with the agreed thresholds and recommending  appropriate actions to be carried out system-wide. 5. This procedure is not intended to provide for comparative ranking of DOEs, but to indicate  the level of performance and compliance of individual DOEs with the A6.4 accreditation  requirements. Its implementation should be complemented with system-wide analysis and  improvement. 6. The results of the DOE performance monitoring are communicated in the following ways  to DOEs, the AEP and the Supervisory Body:  (a) Reporting to DOEs on their performance with the three main objectives:  (i) Providing feedback on their performance with relevant information that would  allow them to conduct a root-cause analysis of the deficiencies in their  validation/verification work;  (ii) Informing DOEs of their performance and level of their performance  indicators so that they are aware of whether the thresholds have been  reached or are about to be reached;  (iii) Informing DOEs of whether any further action has been decided on;  (b) Reporting to the AEP to provide information for its informed decision-making in  accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”;  (c) Reporting to the Supervisory Body as the final decision-making body to provide it  with all relevant data for its decision-making in accordance with the A6.4  accreditation procedure as well as to allow the Supervisory Body to make system-  wide improvements. 3  In accordance with paragraph 98 of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes  of activities”, the assessment of inclusion of CPs is done on a sample basis. 4  In accordance with the paragraph 259 of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for  programmes of activities”, the assessment of renewals of the crediting periods of CPs is done on a  sample basis. 5  This also includes the verification of the transition of clean development mechanism (CDM) activities to  the Article 6.4 mechanism. Therefore, the performance of the CDM DOEs that are allowed to verify and  certify the requests for issuance from transitioned activities (as per paragraph 22 of the meeting report  on the Supervisory Body at its eighth meeting (https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-  sb008.pdf)) is required to be monitored in accordance with this procedure.  5 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 2.2. Applicability 7. This procedure is applicable to the performance of DOEs during their entire accreditation  term, that is from the date of accreditation by the Supervisory Body until the expiry of  accreditation. The provisions of this procedure are not applicable during a suspension of  accreditation of DOEs. 8. The monitoring of the performance of DOEs is based on the compilation of data through  the assessment of the requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and  A6.4 PoAs; requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal  of A6.4 PoA period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request for renewal of A6.4 CPs;  and requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the  prior-approval track submitted by DOEs.6 2.3. Entry into force 9. Version 01.0 of this procedure enters into force on 9 October 2024. 3. Definitions 10. The following definitions of terms are used in this document:  (a) DOE performance: how successfully a DOE carries out its validation and  verification functions, as defined in the RMPs for the Article 6.4 mechanism and  the Supervisory Body;  (b) Non-compliance: failure to meet Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements. 4. Data compilation and classification of information on  performance 4.1. Classification and grading of instances of non-compliance 11. The monitoring of the performance of a DOE is based on the compilation of data through  the assessment and review, as applicable, of the requests for registration and issuance  for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs; requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4  projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs;  request for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4  PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track submitted by the DOE.7 The  identification of non-compliances, if any, and their classification into predetermined  categories is as follows:  (a) Issues related to reporting;  (b) Issues related to failure to follow procedural requirements;  (c) Technical correctness and accuracy issues with regard to failure to identify non-  compliance with Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements; 6  See footnote 5. 7  See footnote 5.  6 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0  (d) Other issues, to analyse system-wide gaps and improve classification. 12. Appendices 1, 2 and 3 divide the above-identified categories into subcategories for the  processes of requests for registration for both A6.4 projects and PoAs; requests for  renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;  requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs and request for renewal of A6.4 CPs (see Appendix 1);  requests for issuance of both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs (see Appendix 2); requests for  approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval  track (see Appendix 3).8 This further subcategorization is provided in order to reduce the  level of subjectivity during the identification of instances of non-compliance and to provide  sufficient information to DOEs to allow them to understand their performance and  appropriately focus their internal improvement efforts. 13. Appendices 1, 2 and 3 also include a weighting for the various categories based on the  severity and potential impact on the credibility of the accreditation processes. A linear  scale using values between 1 (minimum) and 5 (maximum) is used in order to minimize  subjectivity during the rating while still allowing sufficient differentiation between the issues  based on the severity. 4.2. Definition of performance indicators 14. Based on the classification and weights referred to in paragraphs 11−13 above, the  secretariat shall measure, for each DOE, the performance indicators defined in paragraph  15 below. 15. The secretariat shall calculate, for each of the requests submitted during a given  monitoring period as defined in paragraph 25 below, the following performance indicators:  (a) Indicator I1,9 which includes the following two subindicators:  (i) Indicator I1,CC (rate of incomplete submissions at completeness check (CC)),  calculated as the number of requests concluded as incomplete at  completeness check divided by the number of requests submitted which  have completed the cycle,10 regardless of the number of issues identified in  each incomplete submission:  a. Indicator I1,CC = number of requests concluded as incomplete at CC /  number of requests completed;  b. Indicator I1,CC is to monitor the following types of requests:11  i. Requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects  and A6.4 PoAs; 8  See footnote 5. 9  The indicators I1,CC and I1,SC shall take into account the number of times a particular request is rejected  at CC or substantive check (SC). Therefore, if the same request is rejected at CC or SC multiple times,  the re-submission of the same request shall be counted as a different request. 10  A request completes its cycle once a final decision (approval, rejection or withdrawal) is taken in a given  monitoring period. 11  See footnote 5.  7 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0  ii. Requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects;  iii. Requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;  iv. Requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs;  v. Request for renewal of A6.4 CPs;  vi. Requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and  A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track;  (ii) Indicator I1,SC (rate of incomplete submissions at substantive check (SC))  calculated as the number of requests concluded as incomplete at SC divided  by the number of requests submitted which have completed the cycle,  regardless of the number of issues identified in each incomplete submission:  a. Indicator I1,SC = number of requests concluded as incomplete at SC /  number of requests completed;  b. Indicator I1,SC is to monitor the following types of requests:12  i. Requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects  and A6.4 PoAs;  ii. Requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects;  iii. Requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;  iv. Requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs;  v. Requests for renewal of A6.4 CPs;  vi. Requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and  A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track;  (b) Indicator I2, which includes the following three subcategories and is to calculate the  risk priority number (RPN) value based on the steps specified in Appendix 4 at the  stage when a request for review is raised:  (i) Indicator I2,REG:  a. When the number of review cases during a given monitoring period  is:  i. Higher than or equal to 3:13  Indicator I2,REG = Proportion of the RPN values resulting from  requests for review for each DOE over the RPN mean value  resulting from all requests for review for all DOEs; 12  See footnote 5. 13  This does not include the situation where the kth DOE has a request for review case higher than or equal  to 3, but this DOE is the only DOE having the request for review cases in a given monitoring period. This  type of situation will be treated as “less than 3”.  8 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0  ii. Less than 3:  Indicator I2,REG = RPN value resulting from requests for review  for each DOE;  b. Indicator I2,REG is to monitor the following types of requests:14  i. Requests for registration for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs;  ii. Requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects;  iii. Requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;  iv. Requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs;  v. Request for renewal of A6.4 CPs;  (ii) Indicator I2,ISS:  a. When the number of review cases during a given monitoring period  is:  i. Higher than or equal to 3: 15  Indicator I2,ISS = Proportion of the RPN values resulting from  requests for review for each DOE over the RPN mean value  resulting from all requests for review for all DOEs;  ii. Less than 3:  Indicator I2,ISS = RPN value resulting from requests for review for  each DOE;  b. Indicator I2,ISS is to monitor the requests for issuance for both A6.4  projects and PoAs;16  (iii) Indicator I2,PRC:  a. When the number of review cases during a given monitoring period  is:  i. Higher than or equal to 3: 17  Indicator I2,PRC = Proportion of the RPN values resulting from  requests for review for each DOE over the RPN mean value  resulting from all requests for review for all DOEs; 14  See footnote 5. 15  See footnote 13. 16  See footnote 5. 17  See footnote 13.  9 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0  ii. Less than 3:  Indicator I2,PRC = RPN value resulting from requests for review  for each DOE;  b. Indicator I2,PRC is to monitor requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4  projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track.18 16. The indicators shall be calculated based on those requests for which a final decision  (approval, rejection or withdrawal as per paragraph 17 below) was taken in a given  monitoring period. 17. The withdrawal of a submitted requests for registration or issuance for an A6.4 project or  A6.4 PoA; requests for renewal of crediting period of an A6.4 project; requests for renewal  of an A6.4 PoA period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; requests for renewal of A6.4  CPs, and requests for approval of PRCs to an A6.4 project, A6.4 PoA and A6.4 CPs under  the prior-approval track shall be treated as follows:  (a) Such withdrawal of a submitted request shall not be counted in the calculation of  indicators I1,CC and I1,SC;  (b) Such withdrawal of a submitted request shall:  (i) Not be counted in the calculation of indicator I2, if the withdrawal request is  made prior to the respective notification of request for review;  (ii) Be counted in the calculation of indicator I2, if the withdrawal request is made  after the respective notification of request for review. 4.3. Data compilation and calculation of indicators 4.3.1. Data compilation and calculation of indicators I1,CC and I1,SC 18. Once a DOE submits a request for registration or issuance for an A6.4 project or A6.4  PoA; request for renewal of crediting period of an A6.4 project; request for renewal of A6.4  PoA period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request renewal of A6.4 CPs; and request  for approval of PRCs to an A6.4 project, A6.4 PoA and A6.4 CPs under the prior approval  track, the secretariat shall assess the submitted documentation at two stages to determine  whether it meets the Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and shall calculate  the indicators as follows:  (a) At the CC stage: based on this assessment, the submission shall be deemed  complete or incomplete. Based on the rate of submissions concluded as  incomplete, the indicator I1,CC shall be calculated;  (b) At the SC stage: based on this assessment, the submission shall be deemed  complete or incomplete. Based on the rate of submissions concluded as  incomplete, the indicator I1,SC shall be calculated;  (c) Indicators I1,CC and I1,SC shall be calculated based on paragraph 15(a) above. 18  See footnote 5.  10 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 4.3.2. Data compilation and calculation of indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and I2,PRC 19. Once a DOE submits a request for registration or issuance for an A6.4 project or A6.4  PoA; request for renewal of crediting period of an A6.4 project; request for renewal of A6.4  PoA period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request renewal of A6.4 CPs; and a request  for approval of PRCs to an A6.4 project, A6.4 PoA or A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval  track,19 the secretariat shall assess the submitted documentation at the stage of request  for review to determine whether it meets the A6.4 mechanism rules and requirements and  shall calculate the indicators as follows:  (a) At the request for review stage: the following steps have to be followed to calculate  indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and I2,PRC:  (i) Non-compliance issues shall be identified and classified into categories and  subcategories as specified in appendices 1, 2 and 3;  (ii) Weighting factors for the criticality and historical frequency of each issue  identified shall be attached to each issue. Each request will be given a RPN  value based on the identified weights of individual issues,20 including those  that are closed after the provision of further information/documentation by  the DOE;  (iii) The weighting of non-compliance issues shall be finalized only after a final  decision on the specific request has been made;  (b) Based on the final weighting of the issues identified, the indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and  I2,PRC shall be calculated based on paragraph 15(b) above. 5. Definition of thresholds 5.1. Thresholds for indicators I1,CC and I1,SC 20. The secretariat shall calculate the respective thresholds TH,I1,CC,y and TH,I1,SC,y for  indicators I1,CC and I1,SC for a given yth monitoring period using the bootstrapping method  as specified in Appendix 4. 21. The defined thresholds for DOEs within the yth monitoring period are reached when:  (a) At the CC stage: The threshold is reached when the value of I1,CC is > TH,I1,CC,y;  (b) At the SC stage: The threshold is reached when the value of I1,SC is > TH,I1,SC,y. 22. The kth DOE is considered to be in the “green zone” if its indicator I1,CC is equal to or less  than TH,I1,CC,y or its indicator I1,SC is equal to or less than TH,I1,SC,y. 23. The kth DOE is considered to be in the “red zone” if its indicator I1,CC is more than TH,I1,CC,y  or its indicator I1,SC is more than TH,I1,SC,y. 19  Given that the A6.4 activity cycle procedure for A6.4 projects and A6.4 activity cycle procedure for A6.4  PoAs allow all subtypes of PRCs to be submitted together in a single submission, the submission shall  be assessed as a whole, covering all subtypes of PRCs. 20  Those issues across the subtypes of PRCs are included in the calculation of the indicator I2,PRC.  11 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 5.2. Thresholds for indicator I2 24. For the indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and I2,PRC, the respective thresholds are identified as follows:  (a) When the number of review cases is higher than or equal to 3 in a given monitoring  period, the DOE is considered to be:  (i) In the “green zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is less than 0.6;  (ii) In the “yellow zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal  to 0.6 but less than 0.8;  (iii) In the “red zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal to  0.8;  (b) When the number of review cases is less than 3 in a given monitoring period, the  DOE is considered to be:  (i) In the “green zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is less than 6;  (ii) In the “yellow zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal  to 6 but less than 10;  (iii) In the “red zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal to  10. 6. Monitoring periods 25. The performance of DOEs shall be monitored and the performance indicators calculated  based on requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs;  requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA  period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; requests for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests  for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval  track submitted during monitoring periods of six months. Each year, a monitoring period  starts on 1 January and ends on 30 June, followed by the next monitoring period, which  starts on 1 July and ends on 31 December. 26. The secretariat shall gradually calculate the indicators at the end of the monitoring period  as the requests become finalized. 7. Reporting on DOE performance 7.1. Types of reports 27. The secretariat shall prepare the following DOE performance monitoring reports:  (a) A6.4-FORM-ACCR-026: DOE performance monitoring report to DOEs;  (b) A6.4-FORM-ACCR-027: DOE performance monitoring report to the A6.4  Supervisory Body and AEP;  (c) A6.4-FORM-ACCR-028: DOE performance monitoring report to the public.  12 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 28. DOEs may seek clarification from the secretariat on the content of the report to DOEs  referred to in paragraph 27(a) above via a dedicated email address. The secretariat shall  consider the clarification requests and provide responses. 29. In addition to the DOE performance monitoring reports, the secretariat shall prepare a  biennial report containing a detailed analysis of the issues arising from the performance  of DOEs, in particular any issues that highlight shortcomings in the existing standards or  procedures. This report shall provide information to the Supervisory Body and assist it in  developing or revising its workplans and those of its panels. 7.2. Frequency of reporting 30. The secretariat shall prepare the DOE performance monitoring reports based on the data  related to requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs;  requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA  period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; requests for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests  for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior approval-  track finalized within seven months of the end of each monitoring period. The secretariat  shall issue the DOE performance monitoring report no later than eight months after the  end of the same monitoring period. 8. Actions to be undertaken based on DOE performance  monitoring 31. Based on the outcome of DOE performance monitoring, different actors shall take a set of  actions as described in the paragraphs that follow. 8.1. Actions to be undertaken by DOEs 32. If any of the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE has reached the  threshold for the indicators I1,CC and/or I1,SC or is in the yellow zone or red zone of indicators  I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC, the DOE shall undertake a root-cause analysis to identify the causes  of the deficiencies in its system and implement appropriate corrective and/or preventive  actions to improve its performance. 33. The DOE shall be responsible for ensuring that corrective and/or preventive actions  identified as a result of the root-cause analysis are adequate and address the identified  issues in a systematic manner. 34. In addition to the measures as per paragraph 33 above and to ensure prompt action and  effective measures at place, the DOEs shall undertake root cause analysis, corrections,  corrective actions and preventative actions in accordance with the requirements specified  in the “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation”, section 13.6 upon receipt of information of any  unsuccessful validation or verification and certification submission by the secretariat and  review raised by the Supervisory Body. For all such cases, within 45 days upon receipt of  such notification by the secretariat, the DOEs shall submit evidence of all the actions taken  to the secretariat through the dedicated e-mail address. The AEP shall consider the  actions reported by the DOE at its next meeting and decide further measures.  13 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 8.2. Actions to be undertaken by the secretariat 35. The information contained in the DOE performance monitoring reports shall be used to  prepare the workplan of the regular surveillance assessment or the reaccreditation  assessment, whichever is to be conducted earlier. 36. If the DOE performance monitoring reports corresponding to two consecutive monitoring  periods show that a DOE has been in the red zone with regard to performance indicators  I1,CC or I1SC, the workplan shall include an instruction to the Assessment Team (AT) to  assess whether the DOE has carried out a root-cause analysis as a result of the DOE  performance monitoring and that the corrective and/or preventive actions identified were  correctly undertaken in the next assessment. The AT shall report the result of this  assessment in its assessment report. 37. If the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the yellow zone of  indicator I2, the workplan shall include an instruction for the AT to assess whether the  corrective and/or preventive actions identified were correctly undertaken in the next  assessment. The AT shall report the result of this assessment in its assessment report. 38. If the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the red zone for indicator  I2, the secretariat shall report the cases to the AEP in accordance with paragraph 43 below. 8.3. Actions to be undertaken by the Article 6.4 Accreditation Expert Panel 39. Based on the data reported by the secretariat to the AEP, including instances where the  Supervisory Body approved the requests but issues pertaining to the submissions  identified by the Supervisory Body indicate a decline in the DOE performance in validation  or verification, the AEP, at its next meeting or the subsequent meeting, shall decide on the  number and type of performance assessments; the areas to be assessed during the  performance assessments, regular on-site surveillance assessments and reaccreditation  assessments; and/or any appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory Body supported  by proper justification or the applicable provisions specified in the “Procedure: Article 6.4  accreditation”. The Supervisory Body shall consider such a recommendation at its next  meeting and decide on the course of action. 8.3.1. Number of performance assessments 40. If the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the yellow zone for  indicator I2,REG or I2,ISS in three consecutive monitoring periods, the AEP shall add one  additional performance assessment to the number of planned performance assessments.  The nature of this performance assessment shall be defined considering the process that  reached the threshold, as follows:  (a) If the threshold is reached as a result of the registration process, a validation  performance assessment shall be conducted;  (b) If the threshold is reached as a result of the issuance process, a verification  performance assessment shall be conducted. 41. These performance assessments, when possible, shall be on the sectoral scopes and/or  methodologies where the DOE recurrently fails to perform appropriately according to the  results of the DOE performance monitoring reports.  14 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 42. The AEP shall reduce one performance assessment from those added performance  assessments for a DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure” when  four consecutive monitoring periods show that the indicator I2,REG or I2,ISS has remained in  the green zone. 8.3.2. Activation of spot-checks 43. The AEP shall initiate a spot-check of a DOE if the DOE is in the red zone of indicator I2  in the DOE performance monitoring report. 8.4. Actions to be undertaken by the Supervisory Body 44. The Supervisory Body, based on the information reported by the secretariat, shall take  note of the performance of DOEs. 45. The Supervisory Body may also, based on the analysis provided by the secretariat, identify  any measures to improve its regulatory framework.  15 of 44  I  1  1  issues  Wei  -ght  Version 01.0  reporting  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002  documents  information  registration and issuance  presented in the  Issues related to  Criteria for classification of  Inconsistencies in the  Prior consideration  Compliance with the host  Party’ s indication of activity type  Project description  Avoidance of double or revived  registration  for renewal of A6.4 CPs  Selection of methodologies and  standardized baselines and their  applicability  Deviation from or revision of the  selected methodology  Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities 16 of 44  Application of methodologies and  standardized baselines, including  project boundary, baseline  scenario, additionality, risk of  non-permanence, estimation of  reduction and monitoring plan  Start date, crediting period type  and duration  Environmental impacts, social  impacts and sustainable  development of co-benefits  Local or subnational stakeholder  consultation complete  Global stakeholder consultation  Approval and authorization  Modalities of communication  Procedural and related  requirements  Eligibility for inclusion of  component projects  for both A6.4 projects and Article 6.4 mechanism programmes of activities  for inclusion of Article 6.4 mechanism component projects (CPs); and requests  projects; requests for renewal of Article 6.4 mechanism PoA period; requests  Appendix 1.

Calculation of the threshold for indicators 1. Calculation of the threshold for indicator I1 1. The bootstrap method applied to establish the thresholds for indicators I1,CC and I1,SC  comprises the following steps:  (a) Observe k subgroups of size n for a total of n*k=N observations (k refers to the kth  designated operational entity (DOE) and n to the number of submissions for each  DOE);  (b) Draw a random sample of size n, with replacement, from the pooled sample of N  observations. This sample, x*1, x*2,..,x*n, is a bootstrap sample;  *  (c) Compute the sample mean ( X ) from the bootstrap sample drawn in step (b);  (d) Repeat steps (b)–(c) M times;  (e) Sort the M bootstrap estimates:  X 1* , X 2* ,..., X M* ;  *  (f) Find the smallest ordered X such that (1- α)*M values are below it, which is the  threshold for indicators.  (g) It is required that:1  (i) The size of the random samples in each group (i.e. monitoring periods) is  the number of submissions in each monitoring period;  (ii) The value of M is 10,000;  (iii) The value of α is 0.05;  (iv) The maximum of five years of historical data before the end of the given  monitoring period are applied. 1  The value of M (10,000) is selected based on the standard recommended by the scientific community  in order to avoid bias between the real population and the bootstrapping result. The value of α (0.05) is  the most-used threshold applied in the scientific literature, and the historical data period is to stabilize  the indicator. Therefore, the effectiveness of these values in improving the quality of validation and  verification processes should be analysed during the inception of the implementation of this procedure  for a duration of no less than two years.  38 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 2. Calculation of indicator I2 2. Indicator I2 is to calculate the risk priority number (RPN) value, which comprises the  following steps:  (a) Weight of frequency for issues of each type raised (Fj):  (i) Count the number of issues of each type identified and rank them from  lowest to highest;  (ii) Transform the rank into a 5-scale system;  (iii) Determine the square root of 5-scale values, which is the value of Fj;  (iv) Note that:  a. The term “j” indicates issues of each type raised as per the  categorization listed in appendices 1 to 3;  b. If the number of issues is repeated for two different types, then these  two issues get the minor value on the scale between these two types  of issues;  c. The frequency of issues of each type raised is derived from at least  five monitoring periods from the past. If the number of request for  review cases is less than 20, the past monitoring periods shall be  extended further to ensure there are at least 20 request for review  cases. This historical frequency is used to establish the RPN mean  value;  d. If the number of review cases is less than 3 in a given monitoring  period, the value of Fj is defaulted to 1 while calculating the average  RPN value;  (b) Weights of criticality for issues of each type (Cj): Respective weights for  classification of issues are defined in appendices 1 to 3;  (c) RPN calculation:  (i) Multiply Fj by Cj with number of issues raised (Nj) to calculate the RPN  value for each request for review cases;  (ii) Calculate the RPN mean value from each request for review RPN values;  (iii) Note that for the indicator I2, if the number of review cases is 2 for the kth  DOE in a given monitoring period (i.e. under the category of less than 3),  the average RPN values of these 2 cases will be used as the indicator I2 for  the kth DOE;  (iv) Note that for the indicator I2, as referred in the footnotes 13, 15 and 17 in  main body of this procedure, where the kth DOE has requests higher than  or equal to 3, but this DOE is the only DOE having the request cases in a  given monitoring period, the average RPN values of those request cases  will be used as the indicator for the kth DOE.  39 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 3. Example of the indicator I2 by applying the request for issuance  submissions 3. Table 1 below is an example of the application of provisions specified in section 2 above.  There are 30 requests for review raised in a given monitoring period. Based on the  respective values of Cj, Fj and Nj from each request for review case, the respective RPN  value for each case can be calculated, from which the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.17) can  be established.  40 of 44  A6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities Version 01.0 Table 1.

Table 2 below illustrates the conclusion of the performance monitoring outcome as follows:  (a) Both DOE I and DOE A have the number of review cases higher than or equal to  3 during the monitoring period (i.e. 3 and 10 requests for review raised for DOE I  and DOE A, respectively), and therefore both DOE I and DOE A apply the threshold  specified as per paragraph 24(a) of this procedure. The conclusions of the  performance monitoring are as follows:  (i) All 3 requests for review cases by DOE I have the same RPN value (i.e.  17.18, 17.18 and 17.18), which is above the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.77).  The proportion of cases over the RPN mean value (i.e. 1, which is due to all  3 cases being above the RPN mean value) is higher than 0.8, so the DOE I  is in the red zone;  (ii) DOE A has 10 request for review cases and only 1 project (i.e. project no. 2),  whose RPN value (i.e. 18.39) is higher than the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.77).  The proportion of cases over the RPN mean value (i.e. 0.1, since there is  only 1 case out of 10 that is higher than the RPN mean value) is lower than  0.6, so DOE A is below the yellow zone;  (b) The other 12 DOEs have less than 3 request for review cases, and therefore the  threshold is defined as per paragraph 24(b) of this procedure. The conclusions of  the performance monitoring are as follows:  (i) DOE M’s RPN value (i.e. 10) is equal to 10 and therefore it is in the red zone;2  (ii) DOE L’s RPN value (i.e. 6) is equal to 6 and therefore it is in the yellow zone;  (iii) DOE N’s RPN value (i.e. 8) is higher than 6 but lower than 10, and therefore  it is in the yellow zone.

The selection of expert panel members shall be either from the existing rosters of experts  or through a specific call for experts. If from the existing rosters, the secretariat shall  confirm with experts in the roster whether they are interested in serving as panel members. 11. The Supervisory Body may consider launching a call for experts for renewal of  membership within the panel or whenever specific expertise is needed or sought. 12. The selection process, where applicable, includes:  (a) The launch of the call for applications;  (b) Eligibility checks;  (c) Screening process (interviews, performance evaluation);  (d) Consultation with the co-chairs of the respective panel or assigned members;  (e) Shortlisting; and  (f) Selection by the Supervisory Body. 5.2.1. Launch of call for applications 13. When the Supervisory Body decides to open a call for experts, the secretariat shall launch  the call for a minimum period of 15 days. The secretariat shall ensure that the  announcement reaches a wide audience and is well distributed across all regions. 14. The secretariat shall ensure the following information is available to applicants at the time  of the call:  (a) General information on the selection process and timelines;  (b) The ToR, which includes, inter alia, information on competence requirements,  modalities of work, code of conduct of the Supervisory Body and remuneration for  panel members;  5 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels Version 03.0  (c) Application questionnaire related to demonstration of competence requirements. 15. Experts interested in being appointed as members of any of the panels, and existing panel  members who wish to reapply for a new term, shall respond to the call for applications by  the deadline specified on the call page to be considered. 5.2.2. Eligibility check 16. The secretariat shall undertake an eligibility check of applicants. The following items  constitute the eligibility criteria:  (a) Submission of a completed P.11 form and a completed application questionnaire  by the deadline specified in the call for applications;  (b) Confirmation of agreement to all provisions of the ToR;  (c) Fulfilment of competence requirements as presented in table 1 above. 17. Any failure to agree to the ToR and the code of conduct provisions, late submission of a  completed P.11 form and/or application form, or non-fulfilment of the competence  requirements shall result in disqualification. 5.2.3. Screening process 18. An application form that is only partially completed shall be evaluated based on the  information provided. In case of any discrepancies between the information provided in  the submitted application form and the P.11 form, the most conservative response shall  be regarded as the applicable response. 19. The further process for evaluation of applicants depends on whether an applicant is  external (i.e. new) or an existing panel member who has reapplied. External applicants  may be invited to participate in an interview via telephone or internet-based call to assess  their competencies, whereas re-applying members shall be considered to have fulfilled  the competence requirements and therefore are evaluated based on the extent of  fulfilment of their role as appointed members (see section 6 below). 5.2.3.1. External applicants – interviews 20. The secretariat shall prepare a list of applicants for interviews (interview list) based on the  criteria referred to in paragraph 21 below and in consultation with the relevant panel co-  chairs (see section 5.2.4 below). The secretariat shall seek to ensure that applicants  represent a fair regional balance, including at least three applicants from each region,  where possible. 21. The criteria for inclusion of external applicants in the interview list are as follows:  (a) Eligibility;  (b) Extent and depth of technical competencies;  (c) Relevance of technical competencies for the panel’s workplan (e.g. special skills);  (d) Regional affiliation;  (e) Gender.  6 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels Version 03.0 22. In case of applications for multiple panels, and in accordance with the composition  requirements of the AEP and MEP as specified in appendix 1 of the ToR, applicants may  be interviewed for the multiple panels in one interview. 23. The interviews shall be conducted by interview panels consisting of cross-unit secretariat  staff with process and technical skills. Each interview shall last no longer than 45 minutes  per applicant. 24. The interview panels shall use a standardized set of interview questions for each panel or  working group and record the results of the interviews in the form of numeric values. 25. Applicants’ competencies shall be evaluated based on the parameters listed in table 1  above with specific attention to oral and general communication skills in English  (satisfactory/non-satisfactory), the type (technical/academic/political) of previous work,  specific attributes as a member (value-added) and other issues (e.g. multiple  applications). 26. For applicants with similar skills, preference shall be given to an applicant whose  membership will contribute to balanced regional representation and/or gender balance. 5.2.3.2. Reapplying members – performance evaluation 27. Reapplying members’ applications shall be evaluated based on the performance  evaluation, as referred to in section 6 below, of the extent of fulfilment of their  responsibilities as appointed members. 28. For consideration in the selection process, members’ performance results shall, as a  minimum, cover two full meetings, and for members of the MEP, the assignment of at least  two cases. If a member has been absent and only participated in one meeting, the matter  shall be forwarded to the Supervisory Body to determine the appropriate modality for  handling it. Special circumstances such as maternity or extended sick leave should not  negatively impact the performance evaluation of a member. 29. The results of a reapplying member’s performance evaluation shall clearly indicate the  member’s performance according to above average, average or below average. 30. The performance evaluation scores shall generally be treated as indicative. For the  selection process, this implies that special skills may, for example, result in a  recommendation for appointment despite a below-average performance evaluation score;  similarly, a well performing member’s set of skills may be considered superfluous in the  context of the annual workplan for the panel or working group and therefore may not result  in a recommendation for appointment. 5.2.4. Consultation and approval 31. The secretariat shall consult with the co-chairs of the respective panels or working group  throughout the process and seek agreement from them on the following documents  relevant to the selection process:  (a) Final performance evaluations of reapplying members;  (b) Interview list of external applicants;  7 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels Version 03.0  (c) Shortlist of applicants recommended for appointment and applicants as  alternatives to the recommended ones for the Supervisory Body’s consideration. 32. The presentation of the shortlist for the Supervisory Body’s consideration shall include  information on the consultation processes and clearly indicate whether the agreement was  reached on the matters referred to in paragraph 31(a), 3131(b) and 31(c) above and, in  the event that the agreement was not reached, reflect the different views for the  Supervisory Body’s consideration. 33. The co-chairs of the respective panel or working group shall be provided with the following  information:  (a) Full list of applicants, clearly indicating:  (i) Eligible and non-eligible applicants;  (ii) External applicants invited for interviews;  (iii) Applicants who are reapplying members;  (iv) Applicants proposed for inclusion in the longlist referred to in paragraph 35  below;  (v) Applicants proposed for inclusion in the shortlist referred to in paragraph 36  below;  (b) Performance evaluation scores (see section 6 below);  (c) P.11 forms of shortlisted applicants. 34. The co-chairs of the respective panel shall also have access to the following information,  if they so wish:  (a) Interview reports;  (b) P.11 forms of all applicants. 5.2.5. Shortlisting 35. The secretariat shall prepare a longlist, clearly indicating regional affiliation and gender,  which includes:  (a) External applicants whose interview results indicate that they deserve further  consideration;  (b) All reapplying members who meet performance benchmarks. 36. Based on the longlist, the secretariat shall prepare a first draft of a shortlist for  consideration and input by the co-chairs of the respective panel or working group, clearly  indicating regional affiliation and key words related to skills and value-added. The shortlist  shall include:  (a) For the AEP  (i) A total of five applicants recommended for appointment;  (ii) A maximum of three applicants as alternatives;  8 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels Version 03.0  (b) For the MEP:  (i) A total of 14 applicants recommended for appointment;  (ii) A maximum of six applicants as alternatives. 37. The inclusion of applicants in the shortlist or their exclusion from it shall be based on the  consideration of:  (a) Overall composition of skills required in the context of the annual workplans;  (b) Benefits of continuity in membership (i.e. added value of the continuity of the  specific set of skills of reapplying members to the composition of the group) and  benefits of access to new skills and experience;  (c) Regional representation and gender balance. 38. The shortlist shall be circulated to the Supervisory Body as a confidential annex to the  annotations for the next Supervisory Body meeting and presented during the Supervisory  Body meeting by the co-chairs, supported by the secretariat. The shortlist shall be  accompanied by the full list of applicants. 5.2.6. Appointment of membership 39. The Supervisory Body shall consider the shortlist and select members for each panel or  working group. The selected and outgoing members’ names shall be recorded in the  corresponding Supervisory Body meeting report. 40. The secretariat shall notify each applicant of their application status, prioritizing the  notifications to reapplying members. 41. Selected members shall inform the secretariat at the earliest possible time of any  conflicting commitments and shall provide justification for any expected absence, including  partial absence, at a particular meeting. Proper justifications include:  (a) Hospitalization/sickness or emergencies in the immediate family;  (b) Previously planned professional commitments that present a time conflict with the  meeting. 42.

Such a request may be made if the outgoing member has been  assigned work which is placed on the agenda for the next meeting. 44. During the transition period of outgoing and incoming members, newly appointed  members shall be treated as observers until the first meeting of the panel or working group  for the incoming members. Observers may be granted access to the relevant extranet of  the panel or working group upon receipt of a signed oath of service.  9 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004  Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels  Version 03.0  45.

Performance evaluation of members shall be undertaken for each meeting (physical or  electronic), including its pre- and post-meeting tasks.  52. The results of the performance evaluation of individual members shall be treated as  confidential.  53. The secretariat shall ensure that the performance evaluations are undertaken in a  standardized manner by using standard evaluation forms and a reference sheet included  in Appendix 1 to this document.  10 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels Version 03.0 54. The co-chairs of the respective panel or working group and the secretariat shall evaluate  the performance of its individual members. 55. Members’ performance shall be evaluated in the following two areas of activities:  (a) Inter-meeting work (evaluated for each case to which individual members have  been assigned);  (b) In-meeting activity. 56. The performance in inter-meeting work is evaluated as a function of the level of complexity  of the assigned case, the quality of input, and the timeliness of provision of input. 57. The performance in in-meeting activity is evaluated as a function of level of activity and  the quality of inputs during the meetings. 58. The results of the performance evaluations shall be recorded as numeric values and  compiled in a spreadsheet for tracking, analysis and reporting purposes. The results shall  be accompanied by information on members’ adherence to the code of conduct of the  Supervisory Body, including the declaration of no conflict of interest. 6.3. Performance reporting 59. The secretariat shall compile the members’ individual performance evaluation results mid-  term, with the aim of supporting the process of providing feedback on the performance to  the members. The modality for provision of feedback to individual members shall be at the  prerogative of the respective co-chairs. 60. The aim of such feedback shall be to allow a member to improve their performance. Where  the performance evaluation has identified a need for improvement, the feedback may  include, inter alia, an encouragement to the member to be more proactive during  discussions, improve the quality and timeliness of inputs, ensure a higher level of  preparedness for in-meeting discussions, or more actively share his or her expertise with  the rest of the panel or working group members. 61. Where the performance evaluation has identified an unsatisfactory level of performance  of a member with no prospect of improvement, the provisions on suspension and  subsequent termination of membership of the member in the ToR shall apply. 62. If the secretariat receives a query from a member in response to the feedback on their  performance, the secretariat shall process it in consultation with the co-chairs of the  respective panel or working group. 63. The secretariat shall report to the Supervisory Body on the performance of the panel  members by preparing a consolidated performance report. This report shall include data  on the performance of each member. 64. The reporting shall be undertaken prior to the launch of the call for the selection of new  panel and working group members in order to allow the Supervisory Body to consider the  scope for the launch of the call for new members. The report shall be treated as  confidential.  11 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-004 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels Version 03.0 Appendix 1.

Once experts have  been selected, the secretariat shall maintain a database in the form of a roster of experts  containing personal and contact details and records on educational and professional  qualifications. 22. The AEP shall appoint two evaluators from among its own members. The evaluators shall  evaluate applicants for the ARoE and prepare a recommendation for the AEP, with support  from the secretariat. 23. The secretariat shall analyse the information provided in the application documents  submitted by an applicant for the ARoE. If the secretariat considers that a candidate  possibly fulfils the initial qualification requirements, the secretariat shall request the  applicant to submit supporting evidence. The secretariat shall analyse it and submit a  summary to the evaluators, with a recommendation to include the applicant on the ARoE  or reject the application. 24. The two appointed evaluators shall concurrently and independently review the summary  of the information and inform the secretariat on their conclusion on acceptance or rejection 6  The term of experts on the rosters shall be for a minimum period of two years, which can be renewed.

If the two evaluators submit different conclusions, the  secretariat will notify them of the different conclusions. In this case, the evaluators shall  discuss the recommendation further between themselves in an effort to reach an  unanimous conclusion. The evaluators may request the secretariat to send any evidence  received or to seek further information to demonstrate that the candidate meets the  qualification requirements. 25. The AEP, at its next meeting, shall consider the final conclusion of the evaluators and  decide whether to include the applicant on the ARoE or reject the application. 26. Experts on the ARoE shall provide to the secretariat evidence related to any updates to  their educational development, training activities undertaken and work experience relevant  to the specific roles qualified and be subject to regular performance monitoring on their  competence and qualification through evaluation process as specified in section 5.4.1  below. 5.4.1. Performance monitoring 27. The AEP provides oversight to the process of monitoring the performance of all experts  on the ARoE and makes the final decision on the outcomes of the performance monitoring. 28. The monitoring of performance shall be undertaken as follows:  (a) Members of an assessment team will be monitored by the team lead;  (b) The team lead will be monitored by either a senior representative of the secretariat  or another expert to be selected by the secretariat. In the latter case, the selected  expert shall be qualified as a lead A6.4 assessor and shall have at least two years  of lead assessor experience. 29. The following schedule of performance monitoring is established:  (a) Upon the completion of the expert’s first participation as a team member;  (b) For a trainee A6.4 assessor: before being approved as an A 6.4 assessor;  (c) For an A6.4 assessor or technical expert: one on-site observation every two years;  (d) For a trainee lead A6.4 assessor: before being approved as a lead A6.4 assessor;  (e) For a lead A6.4 assessor: one on-site observation every three years or at the  request of the AEP. 30. The secretariat shall share the findings from the performance monitoring report with the  expert. 31. Where a performance evaluation identifies a need for improvement, the evaluated expert  shall submit a proposal on how she/he intends to address all identified issues. The expert  shall endeavor to implement the proposed measures and, upon completion of the  measures, submit to the secretariat relevant evidence. The same evaluator who prepared  the performance report shall re-evaluate the expert based on the evidence provided or  through additional monitoring, depending on the type and significance of the issue(s)  identified, as decided by the secretariat.  8 of 16  A6.4-PROC-GOV-005 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation roster of experts Version 01.0 32. Where a performance evaluation identifies an unsatisfactory level of performance, the  secretariat shall seek a second opinion, if possible, in the same assessment process or in  another assessment process to confirm the evaluation. If the negative evaluation is  confirmed, the secretariat shall inform the evaluated expert. The expert shall have seven  days or be within the duration requested by the AEP, to respond in writing describing  her/his views on the evaluation, including root cause analysis and proposed corrective  actions. The expert shall have 30 days or be within the duration requested by the AEP, to  submit the evidence on the implementation of the proposed corrective actions. 33. The AEP shall consider the results of the monitoring process, relevant evidence and  responses, as applicable, and decide on one of the following options:  (a) Maintain the expert on the same roles qualified on ARoE;  (b) Withdraw the expert from the ARoE;  (c) Take any other appropriate actions.7 34. If an expert was not assigned to any accreditation assessment for more than 30 months  or had been previously removed from the ARoE, the expert shall be subject to the  performance monitoring on his/her first assignment. 35. Information obtained during the performance evaluation and its results shall be treated as  confidential. 5.4.2. Suspension of membership 36. An expert may be suspended from a roster for the following reasons:  (a) She/he has failed to deliver work of the required level of quality and within the  expected time frames; or  (b) She/he has been found to be in breach of the applicable provisions of the code of  conduct as per section 5.2 above, including, the applicable provisions relating to  conflict of interest; or  (c) She/he has been found to be in breach of the confidentiality requirements. 37. If an expert on the ARoE is appointed as a member of the Supervisory Body or the AEP,  the secretariat shall place his/her membership on the ARoE “on hold” for the duration of  his/her term of service on that body. On completion of that membership term the  secretariat shall reinstate him/her on the ARoE after the corresponding evaluation by the  AEP evaluators. 38. The secretariat shall undertake measures to safeguard the impartiality of the member  during these transitions. 7  The appropriate actions may include the following, but are not limited to: reconduct the root cause  analysis; repropose corrective actions; reimplement the proposed corrective actions; or downgrade  his/her ARoE roles.  9 of 16  A6.4-PROC-GOV-005 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation roster of experts Version 01.0 6. Modalities of work 39. The secretariat shall establish an AT for an assessment, selecting its members from the  ARoE in accordance with the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation procedure. 40. When establishing an AT, the secretariat shall take into account the following principles:  (a) Competence of the team: members of the AT shall collectively possess the  necessary competence based on the characteristics of the AE/DOE, the sectoral  scopes for which the AE/DOE is applying or is accredited, and the project activity  or PoA associated with the assessment;  (b) Regional balance: to the extent possible, the AT should include experts from  different regions in order to maintain regional balance and allow capacity-building  in all regions;  (c) Use of resources: to the extent possible, all experts on the ARoE should be utilized  in assessments, according to their expertise, while ensuring that a balance  between external resources and secretariat staff is maintained;  (d) Language: to the extent possible, the AT should include an expert who has  knowledge of the local language relating to the accreditation assessment. 41. The secretariat may attach an observer or a trainee A6.4 assessor to the AT. The cost of  his/her participation as an observer in the accreditation assessment shall be borne by the  secretariat. The rules pertaining to conflict of interest, impartiality and confidentiality for  A6.4 assessors contained in this procedure, shall apply to observers and trainee A6.4  assessors.  10 of 16  A6.4-PROC-GOV-005 Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation roster of experts Version 01.0 Appendix 1.

The grievance panel shall determine within seven days of receipt of the grievance from  the secretariat whether the grievant is eligible to submit the grievance in accordance with  paragraph 35 above and the grievance is within the scope referred to in paragraph 36  above. If the grievance panel determines that the grievant or the grievance does not satisfy  any of these eligibility requirements for grievances, it shall reject the grievance. In this  case, the secretariat shall promptly inform the grievant of the rejection accordingly. In order  to determine the eligibility, the chair of the grievance panel may, through the secretariat,  request the grievant and/or any other individual or organization it deems necessary for  that purpose to provide additional information. 42. Once the grievance panel has confirmed that the grievant and the grievance satisfy all of  the eligibility requirements for grievances, the secretariat shall publish the grievance on  the UNFCCC website and immediately notify the Supervisory Body of the publication of  the grievance. The personal identification and data indicated by the appellant as  confidential as per paragraphs 38(a) and 38(c) above shall not be published. 43. If the grievance contains accusations against specific individuals or organizations that may  trigger legal actions under the relevant domestic laws, the grievance panel shall decide  whether to make publicly available the grievance or any specific information therein, and  request the secretariat not to publish the grievance or to publish a partially redacted  version. 44. Over the entire course of the processing of a grievance, the grievant’s personal details  (name and contact information) shall be made available only to limited members of the  secretariat as necessary, unless otherwise expressly agreed by the grievant.  12 of 18  A6.4-PROC-GOV-006 Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 5.3.3.

The additional  information shall be submitted in 21 days unless the grievant requests for one-time  extension of no longer than 14 days. 46. The grievance panel shall reject the grievance if:  (a) Insufficient information is provided to prepare a recommendation (e.g. the  information is too general, unspecified and, therefore, non-actionable);  (b) Additional information requested in accordance with paragraph 45 above is not  provided by the specified deadline in accordance with paragraph 45 above from  the grievant;  (c) The grievant organization’s legitimacy to represent (potentially) affected  individuals, entities or communities is not explicit and proven, as applicable. 47.

The stakeholders include:  (a) Designated national authorities (DNAs) of the host Party and other participating  Parties;  (b) Designated operational entities (DOEs);  (c) Activity participants;  (d) Indigenous Peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with  disabilities and people in vulnerable situations;5  (e) Other stakeholders. 8. Accordingly, the procedure establishes two main categories of communication methods  for the Supervisory Body, the MEP and the AEP to engage with stakeholders:  (a) Process-based communication: 6 , includes communication provisions  incorporated into approved governance, activity cycle, accreditation, and  methodology processes and procedures. Stakeholders should adhere to the  designated communication channels stipulated for each procedure pertaining to  Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism7, Article 6.4  accreditation 8 , Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure 9 , Development, revision and  clarification of methodologies and methodological tools 10 , and Development,  revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines11.  (b) Non-process-based communication: 12 , includes communication provisions  outside the approved governance, activity cycle, accreditation and methodology  processes and procedures. 5 In recognition of Section 24(a)(ix) of the RMPs. 6 Processed-based communication provides means of communication for stakeholders of the Article 6.4  mechanism to communicate with the secretariat, the Supervisory Body, or the MEP and AEP by providing  clarity on communication provisions in the rules and regulations of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 7 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-006.pdf. 8 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf. 9 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-AC-002.pdf. 10 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-METH-001.pdf. 11 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-METH-002.pdf. 12 Non-process-based communication provides means of communication for stakeholders of the Article 6.4  mechanism to communicate with the secretariat, the Supervisory Body, or the MEP and AEP by  establishing additional means of communication in the implementation of the rules and regulations of the  Article 6.4 mechanism. Non-process-based communication includes: interaction with DNAs; interaction  with designated operational entities (DOEs) or accredited independent entities (AEs); MEP interaction  with forums of project developers and UNFCCC admitted observer organizations; and interaction with  other stakeholders.  4 of 13  A6.4-PROC-GOV-007 Procedure: Direct communication with stakeholders Version 02.0 9.

Introduction 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to  ensure transparency of decision-making and make publicly available its decision-making  framework and decisions, including standards, procedures, and related documents. 2. The Supervisory Body plays a crucial role in developing and overseeing the regulatory  framework that guides the Article 6.4 mechanism’s implementation. In addition to being  transparent, the regulatory documents must be consistent and legally sound to support  the integrity of the carbon markets and emissions reductions under the Article 6.4  mechanism. 3. The CMA, at its sixth session, requested the Supervisory Body to engage, in consultation  with interested stakeholders, further independent scientific and technical expertise and  local communities, and include the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous  Peoples, as relevant, to support its work, including through its expert panels, to review  proposals as necessary and receive independent scientific and technical advice. It further  requested the Supervisory Body to consider relevant international environmental  agreements when carrying out its work, including when implementing the “Standard:  Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and  assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”,1 the “Standard: Requirements for  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”2 and the “Article 6.4  sustainable development tool”. 3 It also requested the Supervisory Body, while ensuring  ongoing continuous improvements to reflect the best available science, to strive to ensure  regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to its adopted standards,  tools and procedures. 4. At its tenth meeting, the Supervisory Body requested the secretariat to undertake an initial  structured legal and editorial review of the regulations and procedures approved by the  Supervisory Body to ensure consistency among the regulations, including with regard to  its Rules of Procedure, and to undertake the first review in 2024 with a view to prepare  relevant proposals for consideration by the Supervisory Body in 2025. In addition, to  facilitate subsequent reviews of regulations, the Supervisory Body requested the  secretariat to establish a periodic structured legal and editorial review system of its  regulations to, among others, ensure transparency and consistency among the  regulations, as well as address any matters brought forward by the Supervisory Body for  consideration in this regard. 2. Scope, applicability, and entry into force 2.1. Scope 5. The purpose of this document is to establish the periodic structured legal and editorial  review system of the Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents governing the Article 6.4 1 Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf. 2 Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf. 3 Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-TOOL-AC-001.pdf.  3 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the periodic review system) and set out its key  components and operational framework. This includes defining the focus of the review,  establishing the frequency and timelines for conducting the reviews, clarifying key roles  and responsibilities of involved actors, and outlining the related decision-making process. 2.2. Applicability 6. This document shall be applicable for the periodic review of all regulatory documents  approved by the Supervisory Body. 2.3. Entry into force 7. This document enters into force on 16 May 2025. 3. Definitions 8. The following definitions of terms are used in this document:  (a) “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;  (b) “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action  is recommended as particularly suitable;  (c) “May” is used to indicate what is permitted. 4. Normative references 9. This procedure should be read in conjunction with the “Decision and documentation  framework”.4 In line with that framework, the Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of  the Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully  accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory Body has authority over and provides guidance  to the activities and processes of the Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the  Supervisory Body shall elaborate upon and be consistent with the CMA decisions. 10. Regulatory decisions of the Supervisory Body relate to the adoption of, or revision to the  Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements developed under its direction. These  decisions are reflected in the adoption of, or revision to, standards (including policy  standards, methodologies, and standardized baselines), procedures, tools (including  policy and methodological tools), guidelines and clarifications (including policy and  methodological clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the  Supervisory Body.5 11. Decisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded in the meeting reports of the Supervisory  Body and their accompanying annexes. The authoritative set of documents containing 4 A6.4-INFO-GOV-005. Available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-005.pdf. While  this framework includes provisions for document control and revision, it does not specifically establish a  formal legal and editorial review process. 5 Ibid.  4 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  regulatory decisions is published on the Article 6.4 mechanism Supervisory Body section  of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website.6 5. Periodic review system 12. Based on the initial review experience and lessons learned, a periodic review system is  hereby established, to ensure transparency and consistency among the regulations,  ensure continued compliance with CMA guidance, and address any matters brought  forward by the Supervisory Body for consideration in this regard. 13. To ensure transparency, the periodic review system shall envisage a formal process for  conducting the periodic reviews, based on clearly defined criteria for legal and editorial  assessments, and implemented according to a structured timeline. Stakeholder feedback  and comments provided in accordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with  stakeholders”7 shall be considered, as relevant. In addition, the secretariat shall provide  the Supervisory Body regular updates on the progress and status of each review, including  key findings and any proposed regulatory amendments. Final approved changes and  review outcomes shall be made available through the UNFCCC website. 14. Periodic reviews shall be undertaken by the secretariat once approved by the Supervisory  Body, and may be triggered by, inter alia:  (a) Scheduled intervals;  (b) New CMA guidance that requires updates to the Article 6.4 mechanism's  operations;  (c) Identification by the Supervisory Body of issues that need to be addressed;  (d) Identification of gaps or weaknesses discovered through implementation  experience or stakeholder feedback; and  (e) Findings from other review processes or other relevant developments that may  necessitate adjustments to the Article 6.4 mechanism's operations. 5.1. Objectives 15. The periodic review system aims to achieve the following objectives:  (a) Establish a structured process for the periodic legal and editorial reviews  and the refinement of the Supervisory Body's regulatory documents. This  process aims to identify issues to consider in relation to relevant international  environmental agreements, relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the  Supervisory Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”.  (b) Improve transparency, legal clarity, and coherence across regulatory  documents to support the smooth operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 6  See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-  body/rules-and-regulations. The review of individual methodologies, methodological tools, standardized  baselines, which are under the purview of the Methodology Expert Panel (MEP), are not within the  scope of the periodic legal and editorial review. 7 A6.4-PROC-GOV-007 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-007.pdf.  5 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  As the mechanism operates within a global climate regime, transparency is crucial  for building trust among Parties, private sector actors, and civil society. Regular  reviews will help identify and correct inconsistencies or ambiguities, ensuring  internal coherence and harmonization with relevant frameworks;  (c) Enhance readability and clarity of the regulations for both technical and non-  technical audiences, ensuring transparent communication of regulatory  requirements. This will ensure that the legal language used is robust, clear, and  aligned with evolving international legal standards and practices, thereby  improving accessibility for all stakeholders;  (d) Support continuous improvement and adaptability by establishing practices for  refining the regulatory framework based on lessons learned, stakeholder feedback,  regulatory developments, and emerging needs;  (e) Promote regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to the  adopted standards, tools and procedures, while ensuring ongoing continuous  improvements;  (f) Address any issues brought forward by the Supervisory Body or  stakeholders, which require legal or editorial clarification. These include providing  a formalized process to address specific legal or operational issues encountered  by the Supervisory Body promptly, ensuring the regulatory framework remains  clear and effective;  (g) Enable meaningful and broad-based stakeholder input. Incorporate in  accordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with stakeholders”, input  from Parties, non-Party stakeholders, and technical experts, consultations with  local communities including the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous  Peoples, as relevant, to support its work. This will foster a transparent, inclusive,  and participatory approach to regulatory governance, and will help enhance the  credibility of the Supervisory Body and overall trust in the Article 6.4 mechanism. 5.2. Focus of the periodic review 16. The periodic review system shall focus on two main aspects:  (a) Legal assessment: Ensuring the regulatory documents consistency with the Paris  Agreement, and relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the Supervisory  Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”; as well as legal  coherence, consistency and clarity.  (b) Editorial assessment: Ensuring that the regulatory documents are clear, concise,  and free from ambiguity or inconsistency in language. 5.2.1. Legal assessment process 17.

If the submission is concluded as qualified for consideration by the Methodological Expert  Panel and the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall make the submission publicly  available on the UNFCCC website for global stakeholder consultation. To facilitate broader  participation, the secretariat shall publish a simplified summary of the methodology or  methodological tool. The secretariat shall also explore various means (e.g., setting up a  mailing list for interested stakeholders, holding webinars) to reach out to a wide range of  stakeholders. The duration of the period for submission of comments for the global  stakeholder consultation shall be 21 days. After this period, the secretariat shall make all  comments received publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 6.1.4. Preparation of draft recommendation 62. The secretariat shall prepare a draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert Panel  on the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool for which the submission has  been deemed qualified, taking into account the comments received in the global  stakeholder consultation, and using the “Form: Approved baseline and monitoring  methodology/methodological tool revision recommendation” . 63. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may, taking into account the  appendix to this procedure, propose that a new or revised consolidated methodology be  prepared covering the scope and applicability of the proposed revised methodology, by  merging it with an approved methodology or other new or revised methodology currently  being developed under this procedure. In this case, the subsequent paragraphs in  section 6.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 64. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,  depending on the technical complexity of the proposed revised methodology or  methodological tool, by selecting a maximum of two independent experts from the roster  of experts referred to in paragraph 20 above to review the submission. If the secretariat  does not find suitable and available experts on the roster, it may use the services of  experts not included on the roster. 65. The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward  the draft recommendation to them for their review. The selected members shall provide  input on the draft recommendation within five days of receipt of it. 66. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the  Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in  paragraph 20 above. 67.

In preparing the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert  Panel may request the proponent to submit a draft PDD or PoA-DD that intends to apply  the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool, in order to facilitate its  consideration if it had not been submitted in the original submission of the request for  revision. Also, if the Methodological Expert Panel identifies issues in the proposed revised  methodology or methodological tool that may be addressed with clarifications or  modifications, the Methodological Expert Panel shall request the secretariat to  communicate the issues to the proponent (“B case”). In these cases, the proponent shall  submit a draft PDD or PoA-DD, provide clarifications or submit a modified proposed  revised methodology or methodological tool as applicable to the secretariat within 28 days  of the communication being made. If the proponent does not respond accordingly by this  deadline, the panel’s submission of a final recommendation to the Supervisory Body may  be delayed accordingly. If the proponent does not respond accordingly within 90 days, the  submission shall be considered withdrawn. The secretariat shall publish the issues raised  by the Methodological Expert Panel and the clarifications or the modified proposed revised  methodology or methodological tool submitted by the proponent on the UNFCCC website. 74. If the Methodological Expert Panel’s draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body is to  approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool, the secretariat shall  communicate a reformatted revised methodology or methodological tool to the proponent  before the conclusion of the meeting at which the proposal is considered. The proponent  shall, within the time frame defined by the Methodological Expert Panel, confirm that the  reformatted revised methodology or methodological tool is acceptable or request  16 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1  modifications to it, in order that the Methodological Expert Panel can finalize a  recommendation to the Supervisory Body by the end of the meeting. If the proponent does  not respond by this deadline, the panel’s submission of a final recommendation to the  Supervisory Body may be delayed accordingly. 75. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory  Body, taking into account the proponent’s responses referred to in paragraphs 73 and 74  above, and publish it in its corresponding meeting report. For a proposed revised  methodological tool, if the recommendation is to approve the proposed revised  methodological tool, it shall also include a list of the existing approved methodologies that  would need to be revised due to the effectiveness of the revised methodological tool. The  secretariat shall place the recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting. 6.1.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 76. At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body  from the Methodological Expert Panel is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall  decide to:  (a) Approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool as  recommended by the Methodological Expert Panel, indicating that:  (i) The revision is a major revision; or  (ii) The revision is a minor revision;  (b) Reject the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool; or  (c) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the  Supervisory Body and provide guidance to the Methodological Expert Panel on the  issues to be reviewed. 77. If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodology or methodological  tool, the secretariat shall publish the approved revised methodology or methodological tool  on the UNFCCC website within seven days of the approval. 78. If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodological tool, it shall  request the Methodological Expert Panel to prepare draft revised methodologies to  introduce or modify references to the revised methodological tool in them, based on the  list in the recommendation from the Methodological Expert Panel referred to in paragraph  75 above, following the process referred to in sections 6.2.2−6.2.4 below. 6.1.7. Other 79. The secretariat shall maintain on the UNFCCC website a publicly available list of all  proposed revised methodologies and methodological tools deemed qualified for  consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel and the Supervisory Body, indicating  the current status in the process. The secretariat shall publish all background documents  related to the rationale for approval, rejection, and any options for resubmission. 80. At any step before the Supervisory Body makes a final decision, the secretariat may  request the proponent to provide additional information regarding the proposed revised  methodology or methodological tool within a defined time frame to facilitate the  17 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1  assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert  Panel and/or the Supervisory Body. If such information significantly affects the outcome  of the assessment/consideration, the secretariat shall make the information publicly  available on the UNFCCC website. 6.2. Top-down process 6.2.1. Initiation 81. The Supervisory Body may, taking into account the appendix to this procedure, decide to  revise an approved methodology (including an approved consolidated methodology) or  methodological tool at any time. The Supervisory Body may consider giving priority to the  revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool based on various factors.  These factors include its relevance to least developed countries and small island  developing States, the priorities of the host country as communicated to the Supervisory  Body, the potential for transformative climate action on a global or regional scale, the  potential for programmatic approaches, and the participation of small and micro  businesses. 82. In this case, the Supervisory Body shall also decide to:  (a) Put on hold the approved methodology or methodological tool, with immediate  effect. In this case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the  UNFCCC website, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, any  request for registration or any request for renewal of crediting period of a project  or PoA applying the methodology or methodological tool from the day following the  date of publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the  decision;  (b) Put on hold the approved methodology or methodological tool, with a grace period  of 28 days. In this case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on  the UNFCCC website, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation,  any request for registration or any request for renewal of crediting period of a  project or PoA, applying the methodology or methodological tool any more  than 28 days following the date of publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting  report containing the decision; or  (c) Maintain the current version of the approved methodology or methodological tool  until the expiry of its validity, in accordance with paragraphs 99−101 below. 83. The Methodological Expert Panel, or the secretariat, may, taking into account the  appendix to this procedure, propose that the Supervisory Body revise an approved  methodology (including an approved consolidated methodology) or methodological tool at  any time. If the Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat considers that the current  version of the methodology or methodological tool should be put on hold, it shall  recommend so to the Supervisory Body. In these cases, the Supervisory Body shall  consider the proposal and/or the recommendation, and decide whether to revise and/or to  put on hold the current version of the methodology or methodological tool in accordance  with paragraph 81 above. 84. Notwithstanding paragraph 83 above, if a member of the Methodological Expert Panel, or  the secretariat, finds that it is necessary to revise an approved methodology or  18 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1  methodological tool to correct an obvious error, the chair and the vice-chair of the  Methodological Expert Panel may decide to directly initiate the revision. 6.2.2. Preparation of draft revised methodology or methodological tool 85. If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved methodology or methodological  tool in accordance with paragraph 82 or 83 above, or the chair and the vice-chair of the  Methodological Expert Panel decide to revise it in accordance with paragraph 84 above,  the secretariat shall prepare a draft revised methodology or methodological tool. 86. In preparing the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, the secretariat may  draw upon external expertise, depending on the technical complexity of the revision, by  selecting a maximum of two independent experts from the roster of experts referred to in  paragraph 20 above, to review the draft revised methodology or methodological tool. If the  secretariat does not find suitable and available experts on the roster, it may use the  services of experts not included on the roster. 87.

The secretariat shall finalize the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, taking  into account the input from the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel and  the relevant working group, and submit it to the Methodological Expert Panel for  consideration at its meeting, at the latest seven days before the meeting. 6.2.3. Consideration by Methodological Expert Panel 90. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the draft revised methodology or  methodological tool and prepare a draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the  draft revised methodology or methodological tool. 91. The secretariat shall make the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body publicly  available on the UNFCCC website for global stakeholder consultation. To facilitate broader  participation, the secretariat shall publish a simplified summary of the methodology or  methodological tool. The secretariat shall also explore various means (e.g., setting up a  mailing list for interested stakeholders, holding webinars) to reach out to a wide range of  stakeholders. The duration of the period for submission of comments for the global  stakeholder consultation shall be 21 days. After this period, the secretariat shall make all  comments received publicly available on the UNFCCC website. If the revision of an  approved methodology or methodological tool has been initiated in accordance with  paragraph 51, 78, 84 above, or 95 below, global stakeholder consultation is not necessary. 92. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory  Body on the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, taking into account the  comments received in the global stakeholder consultation, and publish it in its  corresponding meeting report. For a draft revised methodological tool, the  recommendation shall also include a list of the existing approved methodologies that  19 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1  would need to be revised due to the effectiveness of the revised methodological tool. The  secretariat shall place the recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting. 6.2.4. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 93. At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body  from the Methodological Expert Panel is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall  decide to:  (a) Approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool, indicating that:  (i) The revision is a major revision; or  (ii) The revision is a minor revision;  (b) Reject the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool; or  (c) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the  Supervisory Body and provide guidance to the Methodological Expert Panel on the  issues to be reviewed. 94. If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodology or methodological  tool, the secretariat shall publish the approved revised methodology or methodological tool  on the UNFCCC website within seven days of the approval. 95. If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodological tool, it shall  request the Methodological Expert Panel to prepare draft revised methodologies to  introduce or modify references to the revised methodological tool in them, based on the  list in the recommendation from the Methodological Expert Panel referred to in paragraph  92 above, following the process referred to in sections 6.2.2−6.2.4 above. 6.2.5. Other 96. The secretariat may propose an editorial revision to an approved methodology or  methodological tool at any time. In this case, the secretariat shall submit a draft revised  methodology or methodological tool to the chair of the Methodological Expert Panel for  his/her review. If the chair agrees to the draft revised methodology or methodological tool,  the secretariat shall publish the revised methodology or methodological tool on the  UNFCCC website. The editorial revision shall be noted in the next meeting report of the  Supervisory Body. 7. Update of approved methodology or methodological tool 97. All approved methodologies and methodological tools that have been applied in projects  shall be reviewed at least once every five years based on the latest scientific information.  The Methodological Expert Panel shall review relevant information, consult with the public  and experts as necessary, and prepare a recommendation for consideration by the  Supervisory Body for updating the methodologies and methodological tools where  necessary.  20 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1 8. Validity of new, revised and previous versions 98. An approved new or revised methodology or methodological tool shall be effective from  the date of publication on the UNFCCC website. From this date, a project or PoA may  apply the new or revised version for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for  global stakeholder consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of  a request for renewal of crediting period, in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4  mechanism activity cycle.” 99. If the Supervisory Body approves a revised methodology or methodological tool indicating  that it is a major revision in accordance with paragraph 76(a)(i) or 93(a)(i) above, the  version number of the methodology or methodological tool shall increase by one whole  number (e.g. from 1.0 to 2.0), and the previous version shall continue to be valid  for 240 days from the date that the revised version becomes effective unless the previous  version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a)  or 81(b) above. In this case, for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global  stakeholder consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of a  request for renewal of crediting period in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4  mechanism activity cycle”:  (a) A project or PoA may still apply the previous version during this 240-day period  unless the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in  accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above; and  (b) A project or PoA shall apply the revised version after this 240-day period, or  immediately after its adoption if the previous version has been put on hold in  accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. If a PDD or PoA-DD applying the  previous version has already been published for global stakeholder consultation,  the project participants or coordinating/managing entity shall revise the PDD or  PoA-DD applying the revised version. In this case, the DOE shall not publish the  revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, but submit it when it  submits a request for registration unless otherwise decided by the Supervisory  Body when it approves the revised methodology or methodological tool. 100. If the Supervisory Body approves a revised methodology or methodological tool indicating  that it is a minor revision in accordance with paragraph 76(a)(ii) or 93(a)(ii) above, or if an  editorial revision to an approved methodology or methodological tool has been made in  accordance with paragraph 96 above, the version number of the methodology or  methodological tool shall increase by one fractional number (e.g. from 1.0 to 1.1), and the  previous version shall continue to be valid until the next revision for mandatory use. In this  case, for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder  consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of a request for  renewal of crediting period in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism  activity cycle”, a project activity or PoA may still apply the previous version or any earlier  version until the end of the 240-day period after the next major revision. 101. If the Supervisory Body approves a new or revised consolidated methodology or  methodological tool, the approved methodology or methodological tool that has been  consolidated shall continue to be valid for 240 days from the date when the consolidated  methodology or methodological tool becomes effective unless the approved methodology  or methodological tool that has been consolidated has been put on hold by the Supervisory  Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. In this case, for the purpose of  21 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1  publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submission of a  request for registration, or submission of a request for renewal of crediting period in  accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle”:  (a) A project or PoA may still apply the methodology or methodological tool that has  been consolidated during this 240-day period unless it has been put on hold by the  Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above; and  (b) A project or PoA shall apply the consolidated methodology or methodological tool  after this 240-day period, or immediately after its adoption if the methodology or  methodological tool that has been consolidated has been put on hold in  accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. If a PDD or PoA-DD applying the  methodology or methodological tool that has been consolidated has already been  published for global stakeholder consultation, the project participants or  coordinating/managing entity shall revise the PDD or PoA-DD applying the  consolidated methodology. In this case, the DOE shall not publish the revised PDD  or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation but submit it when it submits a  request for registration unless otherwise decided by the Supervisory Body when it  approves the revised methodology or methodological tool. 102. For the purpose of publication of a monitoring report and submission of a request for  issuance, a project or PoA shall apply the version of the methodology or methodological  tool that the project or PoA has been registered with. If the project participants or  coordinating/managing entity wish to use a later version of the methodology or  methodological tool for the purpose of monitoring of emission reductions or removals after  the registration of the project or PoA, or a DOE, when performing a verification, determines  that permanent changes to the monitoring plan as described in the registered PDD or  PoA-DD, generic CPA-DD, or the monitoring methodology have occurred or expected to  occur, the DOE shall submit a request for approval by the Supervisory Body prior to the  submission of the request for issuance in accordance with the relevant provisions of the  “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle”. 103. The revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool or the consolidation of  methodologies or methodological tools shall not affect registered projects or PoAs until  the end of the crediting periods during which the validity of the version of the methodology  or methodological tool applied to the project or PoA expires. 9. Clarification of approved methodology or  methodological tool 9.1. Bottom-up process 9.1.1. Submission of request for clarification 104.

At any step before the clarification is finalized in accordance with paragraph 110, 111 or  122(a) above, the secretariat may request the enquirer to provide additional information  regarding the request for clarification within a defined time frame to facilitate the  assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert  Panel. If such information significantly affects the outcome of the consideration, the  secretariat shall make the information publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 9.2. Top-down process  If the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat finds it  necessary to clarify provisions of an approved methodology or methodological tool, the  process to revise the methodology or methodological tool as defined in section 6.2 above  shall be followed. In this case, the revised methodology or methodological tool shall  incorporate all relevant clarifications issued prior to the revision.  25 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1 Appendix. Principles for revision, consolidation and  clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools 1. Background 1. This appendix provides guiding principles for initiating a revision to an approved  methodology or methodological tool, for initiating a consolidation of methodologies in  accordance with the relevant section of this procedure, and for initiating a (request for)  clarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool. 2. Principles for revision 2. A revision is the modification of an approved methodology or methodological tool in order  to improve it or broaden its scope and applicability. 3. A revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool may be carried out if one  or more of the following conditions apply:  (a) New or generally accepted scientific evidence indicates that emission reductions  or removal enhancements will be overestimated or underestimated based on the  approved methodology or methodological tool or that the reductions or  enhancements may not be real, measurable and verifiable;  (b) The applicability conditions require broadening to include more potential project  types or conditions for use;1  (c) There are identified inconsistencies, errors and/or ambiguities in the language  and/or formulae used within or between methodologies or methodological tools;  (d) Further simplification (e.g. default values) is required to improve the user-  friendliness of the approved methodology or methodological tool;  (e) Key issues clarified through a request for clarification of the approved methodology  or methodological tool in accordance with section 9 of this procedure are required  to be incorporated in the approved methodology or methodological tool;  (f) There are changes to a methodological tool to which an approved methodology  refers to and the changes affect the provisions of the methodology. 1  A request for revision is suitable for situations where an approved methodology or methodological tool  is not applicable to a project or PoA but the project or PoA is broadly similar to the project or PoAs to  which the approved methodology is applicable. Similarity is based on the nature (technology/measure)  of the project or PoA and the sources of the emissions affected by the project or PoA. For example, an  approved methodology may not be applicable as the sources of emissions affected by the project are  the same as those in the methodology but the technology/measure used in the project is not covered  under the applicability conditions; or the procedures provided in the methodology for estimating  emissions from sources are not applicable because of slight variations in the approach, flow of events  or structure chosen in the project.  26 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1 3. Principles for consolidation 4. The aims of consolidating methodologies or methodological tools are to: (a) make a set of  approved methodologies or methodological tools more concise and user-friendly; and  (b) avoid possible inconsistencies between methodologies or methodological tools.  Consolidation results in the issuance of a new or revised approved consolidated  methodology or methodological tool. 5. A consolidation of two or more proposed new, proposed revised and/or approved  methodologies or methodological tools into a single methodology or methodological tool  may be carried out if:  (a) These methodologies or methodological tools are similar in many of their core  components (e.g. applicability, approach, technology, measure, baseline  determination, demonstration of additionality, emission calculation); and  (b) A new consolidated methodology or methodological tool can be drafted on the  basis of these methodologies or methodological tools, which will be applicable to  all the projects and PoAs that apply at least one of these methodologies or  methodological tools. 6. A consolidated methodology or methodological tool may also include elements from other  proposed new, proposed revised or approved methodologies or methodological tools that  are not part of the consolidation. 7. In consolidating methodologies or methodological tools, a balance has to be made  between reducing the number of methodologies or methodological tools available to  project participants and coordinating/managing entities in the database, and the  complexity of the methodologies and the methodological tools, in order to keep the  database of methodologies and methodological tools lean and concise. 8. If a consolidated methodology or methodological tool involves an approved methodology  or methodological tool, and the consolidated one fully covers the approved one having  been consolidated, then the consolidated one supersedes the approved one. 9. If the range of applicability conditions of a consolidated methodology or methodological  tool does not fully cover the combined range of applicability conditions of the approved  methodologies or methodological tools that have been consolidated, then the original  methodologies or methodological tools are not withdrawn, but revised so that their ranges  of applicability conditions are limited to the project types for which the consolidated  methodology is not applicable. In this case, the consolidation and the revision are carried  out simultaneously. 4. Principles for clarification 10. A clarification on an approved methodology or methodological tool is to clarify:  (a) The applicability of the methodology or methodological tool to a specific (planned)  project or PoA;  (b) Various procedures provided in the methodology or methodological tool, inter alia,  for identifying the baseline scenario, demonstrating additionality, estimating  baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage; or  27 of 28  A6.4-PROC-METH-001 Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools Version 01.1  (c) Monitoring data and procedures provided in the approved methodology or  methodological tool. 11. A clarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool may be requested if:  (a) Any of the provisions of the approved methodology or methodological tool are  unclear or ambiguous, and there is room for interpretation of the provisions; and/or  (b) Rationale or further background information is needed regarding conditions under  which the approved methodology or methodological tool is to be applied.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.1 6 October 2024 Corrective revision to paragraph 6 of sub-section 2.3, Entry into  Force.  01.0 13 July 2023 SB 006, Annex 4  Initial adoption.

Introduction 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted decision 3/CMA.3, containing in its annex  the “Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6,  paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement” (RMPs), setting out principles, key requirements and  processes of the mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the Article 6.4 mechanism). 1 The  aforementioned decision and the RMPs contain, inter alia, provisions for the Supervisory  Body to advance work related to methodologies and standardized baselines. 2. Given the mandates above, the Supervisory Body included the provisions to develop the  process for the development, consideration, and approval of methodologies,  methodological tools, and standardized baselines in its workplan for 2022–2023,2 with the  aim to complete the process by 2023. 2. Scope, applicability and entry into force 2.1. Scope 3. The “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized  baselines” (hereinafter referred to as this procedure) defines the process for the  development of new standardized baselines as well as for revising, clarifying, and  updating approved standardized baselines. 2.2. Applicability 4. This procedure applies to standardized baselines that may be applied for an Article 6.4  mechanism project or programme of activities (PoA). 5. A standardized baseline may also be developed for a group of Parties. The procedure for  the development of standardized baselines for a group of Parties is currently not covered  in this document; it will be approved by the Supervisory Body in the future. 6. This procedure does not contain the process to develop or revise a baseline and  monitoring methodology or methodological tool for the purpose of developing a proposed  standardized baseline, or for using the baseline and monitoring methodology together with  a proposed standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions. 2.3. Entry into force 7. Version 01.0 of this procedure enters into force on 31 March 2024. 3. Normative references 8. The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this  procedure: 1  See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at: https://unfccc.int/documents/460950. 2  Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb002-a02.pdf.  3 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  (a) “Procedure: Activity cycle procedure for project activities” or “Procedure: Activity  cycle procedure for programmes of activities”;  (b) “Guideline: Quality assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment  of standardized baselines”;  (c) “Standard: Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines”;  (d) “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring  methodologies and methodological tools”. 4. Definitions 9. In addition to the definitions in the “Glossary: Article 6.4 mechanism terms”, the following  terms apply in this procedure:  (a) “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;  (b) “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action  is recommended as particularly suitable;  (c) “May” is used to indicate what is permitted;  (d) “Proponent” is a Party, activity participant, international industry organization or  admitted observer organization. 5. Development of a standardized baseline 5.1. Approaches to develop a standardized baseline 10. A standardized baseline shall be developed using one of the following approaches:  (a) A methodological approach contained in an approved, proposed new or revised  baseline and monitoring methodology;  (b) A methodological approach contained in an approved, proposed new or revised  methodological tool; or  (c) The approach in the other relevant methodological standards and guidelines  adopted by the Supervisory Body3. 5.2. Bottom-up process 5.2.1. Submission of a proposed standardized baseline 11. It is the prerogative of the designated national authority (DNA) to propose a standardized  baseline. If an activity participant, an international industry organization, or an admitted  observer organization wishes to submit a standardized baseline, it shall contact the DNA  of the Party for which the standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, the proponent 3  The Supervisory Body may develop further guidance on how to develop a standardized baseline based  on other approaches (e.g., a standardized baseline to address leakage or a standardized baseline to  determine the best available technology at a country level.)  4 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  shall ensure that the proposed standardized baseline complies 4 with the “Standard:  Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines,” including the  requirements related to the data coverage period, data currentness, and the validity5 of  standardized baselines. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed standardized  baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs 14‒17 below. 12. Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 10 above, if the proponent wishes to use a  combination of the approaches for the development of the proposed standardized  baseline, or deviate from the selected approach due to a specific issue of the sector or  geographical area (e.g. country or region),6 the proponent shall provide a justification for  the necessity and the appropriateness of such combination or deviation in the submission  of the proposed standardized baseline. In case of deviation from the approach referred to  in paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above, the proponent shall also justify why a revision of the  approved methodology or methodological tool is not necessary. 13. If the proponent wishes to use a new or revised approach to be contained in a  methodology or methodological tool in accordance with paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above,  or if there is no approved methodology available to be used together with the proposed  standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions, it shall, through the DNA of the  Party for which the standardized baseline is proposed, request approval from the  Supervisory Body of a new or revised methodology or methodological tool in accordance  with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring  methodologies and methodological tools”, through one of the following processes:  (a) Propose a new or revised methodology or methodological tool through the bottom-  up process. 7 In this case, this proposal of a new or revised methodology or  methodological tool shall be referred to in the submission of the proposed  standardized baseline; or  (b) Request the secretariat to propose to the Supervisory Body the top-down  development of a new methodology or methodological tool or the top-down revision  of an approved methodology or methodological tool. In this case, this request shall  be referred to in the submission of the proposed standardized baseline. 4  Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification, when proposing  a new standardized baseline. 5  An alternative length of the validity of a standardized baseline compared to the default validity of three  years may be proposed in accordance with the “Standard: Determining coverage of data and validity of  standardized baselines”. 6  The following are examples of specific issues of the sector or geographical area: (i) the data available  for the development of a proposed standardized baseline have a different vintage than that required by  the approved approach(es); (ii) the default values of baseline and additionality threshold per the  “Guideline for establishment of sector specific standardized baselines” are not applicable in their sector-  specific context and therefore a different value(s) of the threshold is justified. 7  The proposed new or revised methodology or methodological tool for the purpose of developing a  proposed standardized baseline, or the proposed new or revised methodology or methodological tool  that will be used together with the proposed standardized baseline, may be submitted to the secretariat  at the same time with the proposed standardized baseline in accordance with the “Procedure:  development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological  tools”.  5 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 14. The DNA submitting the proposed standardized baseline shall submit the following  documentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website:  (a) The completed “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission”;  (b) A spreadsheet8 containing all data used and the calculations performed for the  establishment of the standardized baseline;  (c) A quality control report prepared in accordance with the “Guideline: Quality  assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized  baselines”;  (d) An assessment report prepared in accordance with paragraphs 15, 16 and 17  below;  (e) All additional documentation supporting the submission (e.g. statistics and/or,  studies etc.), where applicable;  (f) Letter of approval on the proposed standardized baseline from the DNA. 15. In cases where no data collection/processing is required to establish the proposed  standardized baseline:9  (a) The documentation referred to in paragraphs 14(b)−14(c) above are not required  to be submitted;  (a) The assessment report, referred to in paragraph 14(d) above, does not need to  cover the quality assurance and quality control system referred to in paragraph  17(a) below. Consequently, the assessment report only needs to include an  assessment of the compliance of the proposed standardized baseline with one of  the approaches referred to in 17(b) below. 16. The assessment report referred to in paragraph 14(d) above may be prepared by a  designated operational entity (DOE) contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other  entity under the agreement with the DNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be  prepared by a DOE with funding support in accordance with the modalities described in  appendix 1 of this procedure. 17. The assessment report shall include a positive assessment opinion:  (a) On the compliance of the quality assurance and quality control system with the  provisions and data quality objectives of the “Guideline: Quality assurance and  quality control of data in the establishment of standardized baselines”;  (b) That the proposed standardized baseline meets the requirements of:  (i) One of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10 above; 8  In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format. 9  Such cases are standardized baselines developed based only on existence of or lack of a  policy/regulation. For example, since a standardized baseline for landfill gas destruction developed in  accordance with the “Standard: Establishment of sector specific standardized baselines” requires  information only on regulations on the mandatory destruction level, no data collection/processing is  required.  6 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  (ii) A proposed combination of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10  above; or  (iii) One of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10 above with a proposed  deviation from the approach.10 18. No fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed standardized  baseline. 5.2.2. Initial assessment 19. The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:  Proposed standardized baseline initial assessment” within 21 days of receipt of the  submission to determine whether:  (a) The DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 14, 15  and 16;  (b) The “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission” has been completed,  including the name and contact details of the proponent;  (c) The proposed standardized baseline was derived from one of the approaches  referred to in paragraph 10 above;  (d) Except for the cases where an assessment report is not submitted in accordance  with paragraph 16, the assessment report includes the positive assessment  opinion in accordance with paragraph 17 above. 20. The secretariat shall inform the DNA and the proponent of the outcome of the initial  assessment. If the secretariat finds that the required documentation or information is  incomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA  should provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification. 21. The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of the receipt of  missing documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion  of the initial assessment. If the DNA does not provide the missing documents or  information within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission  and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized baseline to  continue to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as  soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if the DNA does  not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the initial notification,  the submission shall be considered withdrawn. 22. Upon successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall assign a  reference number to the proposed standardized baseline and make the submitted  documentation publicly available on the UNFCCC website with the exception of  information declared confidential and/or proprietary by the DNA. Aggregated data and  information used to derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential  or proprietary. 10  If the DOE assesses a proposed standardized baseline with a proposed deviation from an approved  approach(es), the assessment of the proposed deviation is not required.  7 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 5.2.3. Preparation of a draft recommendation 23. Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall  prepare a draft recommendation on the proposed standardized baseline using either:  (a) The “Form: Proposed standardized baseline recommendation” for the  recommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 24(a) or 24(c) below; or  (b) The “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission” for the recommended  course of action referred to in paragraph 24(b) below. 24. The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of  action:  (a) Approve the proposed standardized baseline;  (b) Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted  documentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or  (c) Not approve the proposed standardized baseline. 25. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,  depending on the technical complexity of the proposed standardized baseline and the  availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts  from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable and  available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the  roster. 26. The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel 11 and  forward its draft recommendation to them. 27. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the  Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group, which is  comprised of sectoral experts on the roster. For the purpose of this consultation, the roster  of methodological experts may be grouped into several working groups (e.g. working  group for renewable energy, working group for transport, working group for waste). 5.2.4. Consideration by selected members from the Methodological Expert Panel 28. The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of  receipt of the draft recommendation, independently assess the proposed standardized  baseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the outcome of their  assessment. 29. If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft  recommendation to approve or not to approve the proposed standardized baseline, the  secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it  publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 11  The names, as well as current and past professional affiliations, of the members of the Methodological  Expert Panel will be published on the UNFCCC website. Additionally, the terms of reference for the  support structure of the Supervisory Body will elaborate on the principles and rules that apply to the  Methodological Expert Panel, including provisions related to the code of conduct and conflict of interest.  These terms of reference will be developed by the Supervisory Body.  8 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 30. If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft  recommendation that the proposed standardized baseline requires further input from the  DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using the “Form:  Proposed standardized baseline submission”. The DNA should submit the requested input  within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the “Form: Proposed  standardized baseline submission”. If the DNA submits input including new data, the DNA  should submit a revised assessment report, as applicable, within the same deadline. If the  DNA does not provide the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable,  within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission and ascertain  from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized baseline continue to be  considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as soon as it receives  the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable. In any case, if the  DNA does not provide the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable,  within one year of the initial notification, the submission shall be considered withdrawn. 31. The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed standardized baseline be  approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the  DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. 32. The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input  and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend  that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The  secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the two selected members  of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration. In this case, the steps in  paragraphs 29 above or 33−37 below shall follow. 5.2.5. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel 33. If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the  draft recommendation or requests that it be considered by the Methodological Expert  Panel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert  Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed standardized  baseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is received at least  14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one. 34. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration within two meetings,  unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is  required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is  sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration at the meeting  immediately following the receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration,  the Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed  standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The secretariat shall forward  it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly available on the  UNFCCC website. 35. If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the  secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA  should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not  submit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing  the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed  standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume  processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the  9 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the  submission shall be considered withdrawn. 36. The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed standardized  baseline be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication  with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. 37. The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input  and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend  that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The  secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert  Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to  recommend that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved.  The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make  it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 5.2.6. Preparation of draft standardized baseline 38. If the recommendation is to approve the proposed standardized baseline, before  forwarding it to the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraphs 29, 34 or 37 above,  the secretariat shall:  (a) Reformat the proposed standardized baseline into the form of draft standardized  baseline (DSB) and send it to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel  members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the draft  recommendation last. Upon receipt of an agreement on the DSB from the two  selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological  Expert Panel, as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the DSB to the DNA  and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or request  modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by this  deadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be  delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the DSB and/or requests  modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the DSB and the  response from the DNA to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members,  or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the draft  recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the response from the DNA,  the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall finalize the DSB  within seven days of receipt, or the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the  DSB at its next meeting;  (b) Ensure that the proposed new or revised approach(es) to develop the proposed  standardized baseline and/or the proposed new or revised methodology to be used  together with the proposed standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions  have been approved by the Supervisory Body, if they have been submitted to the  secretariat in accordance with paragraph 13 above; 5.2.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 39. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation received in  accordance with paragraphs 29, 34 or 37 above within 28 days of receipt of the  recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision  adopted by the Supervisory Body.  10 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 40. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat  shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. 41. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days  prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the  Supervisory Body meeting after that one. 42. If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the  following courses of action at the meeting:  (a) Approve the DSB;  (b) Not approve the DSB;  (c) Continue the consideration of the DSB at the next Supervisory Body meeting; or  (d) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation and  provide guidance on the issues for the review. 43. Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  DNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory  Body, as applicable, and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the  UNFCCC website. 44. If the DSB is not approved, the DNA may at any time resubmit a proposed standardized  baseline with revised documentation. Upon submission of the revised documentation, the  submission shall be treated as a new submission of a proposed standardized baseline. 5.3. Top-down process 5.3.1. Initiation 45. The secretariat may propose to the Supervisory Body that the secretariat develop a DSB  at any time following the receipt of an expression of interest from the DNA(s) of a Party(ies)  for which the DSB will be proposed. The Supervisory Body shall consider the proposal  and decide on one of the following courses of action:  (a) Approve the proposed development of the DSB including, if required during the  course of the preparation of the DSB, the top-down development of, revision to, or  deviation from:  (i) An approach to develop the DSB; and/or  (ii) A methodology to be used together with the DSB for the purpose of  estimation of emission reductions;  (b) Not approve the proposed development of the DSB; or  (c) Continue the consideration of the proposed development of the DSB at the next  Supervisory Body meeting. 46. The Supervisory Body may prioritize, as needed, the development or approval of a new  standardized baseline, based on factors such as relevance for least developed countries  and small island developing States, host country priorities communicated to the  11 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  Supervisory Body, potential for transformative climate action at a global or regional scale,  potential for programmatic approaches, and participation of small and micro businesses. 5.3.2.

Before forwarding the DSB to the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraphs 56, 61  or 64 above, the secretariat shall communicate the DSB to the DNA. The DNA shall  confirm that it is acceptable or request modifications to it within 14 days of receipt. If the  DNA does not respond by this deadline, the forwarding of the DSB to the Supervisory  Body may be delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the DSB and/or requests  modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the DSB and the response  from the DNA to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the  Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the DSB last. In this case, taking into  account the response of the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members  shall finalize the DSB within seven days of receipt, or the Methodological Expert Panel  shall finalize the DSB at its next meeting, as applicable. 5.3.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 66. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the DSB received in  accordance with paragraphs 56, 61 or 64 above within 28 days of receipt of the DSB, the  DSB shall be deemed to be approved by the Supervisory Body. 67. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat  shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. 68. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the DSB more than 14 days  prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the  Supervisory Body meeting after that one. 69. If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the  following courses of action at the meeting:  (a) Approve the DSB;  (b) Not approve the DSB;  (c) Continue the consideration of the DSB at the next Supervisory Body meeting; or  (d) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the DSB and provide guidance  on the issues for the review. 70. Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  DNA of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory Body, as applicable,  and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the UNFCCC website.  14 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 6. Revision of a standardized baseline 6.1. Bottom-up process 6.1.1. Submission of proposed revised standardized baseline 71. A proponent may, taking into account the principles for revisions referred to in appendix to  this procedure, propose a revision to an approved standardized baseline through the DNA  of a Party for which the revised standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, if new or  additional data were used to establish the proposed revised standardized baseline, the  proponent shall ensure that the new or additional data used in the proposed revised  standardized baseline complies12 with the “Standard: Determining coverage of data and  validity of standardized baselines,” including the requirements related to the data coverage  period and data currentness. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed revised  standardized baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs 72‒74 below. 72. The DNA submitting the proposed revised standardized baseline shall submit the following  documentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the  UNFCCC website:  (a) The completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”;  (b) The proposed revised standardized baseline, highlighting the proposed changes  to the approved standardized baseline;  (c) A spreadsheet13 containing all data used and the calculations performed for the  establishment of the proposed revised standardized baseline;  (d) A quality control report prepared in accordance with the “Guideline: Quality  assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized  baselines”;  (e) An assessment report on the proposed revised standardized baseline containing  the information referred to in paragraph 17 above and prepared in accordance with  paragraph 73(b) below;  (f) All additional documentation supporting the submission (e.g. statistics and/or,  studies etc.), where applicable;  (g) Letter of approval on the proposed revised standardized baseline from the DNA. 73. In cases where no new or additional data were required to establish the proposed revised  standardized baseline:  (a) The documentation referred to in paragraph 72(d) above is not required to be  submitted;  (b) The assessment report referred to in paragraph 72(e) above does not need to  include a positive assessment opinion on the compliance of the quality assurance  and quality control system referred to in paragraph 17(a) above. Consequently, the 12  Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification when proposing  a revision to an approved standardized baseline. 13  In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format.  15 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  assessment report only needs to include a positive assessment opinion that the  proposed standardized baseline meet the requirements of one of the approaches  referred to in paragraph 17(b) above. 74. The assessment report referred to in paragraph 72(e) above may be prepared by a DOE  contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other entity under the agreement with  the DNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be prepared by a DOE with funding  support in accordance with the modalities described in appendix 1 to this procedure. 75. No fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed revised  standardized baseline. 6.1.2. Initial assessment 76. The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:  Approved standardized baseline revision request initial assessment” within 21 days of  receipt of the submission to determine whether:  (a) The DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 72 and  73 above;  (b) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”, has been duly  completed, including the name and contact details of the proponent;  (c) The proposed revised standardized baseline was derived from the same approach  as the one used in the approved standardized baseline that is being proposed for  revision;  (d) The assessment report includes a positive assessment opinion in accordance with  paragraph 17 above. 77. The secretariat shall inform the DNA and the proponent of the outcome of the initial  assessment. If the secretariat finds that the required documentation or information is  incomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA  should provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification. 78. The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of receipt of the  missing documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion  of the initial assessment. If the DNA does not provide the missing documents or  information within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission  and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised standardized  baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the  submission as soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if  the DNA does not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the  initial notification, the submission shall be considered withdrawn. 79. Upon successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall assign a  reference number to the proposed revision and make the submitted documentation  publicly available on the UNFCCC website with the exception of information declared  confidential and/or proprietary by the DNA. Aggregated data and information used to  derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential or proprietary.  16 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 6.1.3. Preparation of a draft recommendation 80. Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall  prepare a draft recommendation on the proposed revised standardized baseline using  either:  (a) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision recommendation” for the  recommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 82(a) or 81(c) below; or  (b) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request” for the  recommended course of action referred to in paragraph 81(b) below. 81. The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of  action:  (a) Approve the proposed revised standardized baseline, indicating that:  (i) The revision is a major revision; or  (ii) The revision is a minor revision;  (b) Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted  documentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or  (c) Not approve the proposed revised standardized baseline. 82. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,  depending on the technical complexity of the proposed revised standardized baseline and  the availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external  experts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable  and available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the  roster. 83. The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward  its draft recommendation to them. 84. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the  Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in  paragraph 27 above. 6.1.4. Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel 85. The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of  receipt of the draft recommendation, independently assess the proposed revised  standardized baseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the  outcome of their assessment. 86. If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft  recommendation that the proposed revised standardized baseline be approved indicating  that the revision is major, 14 approved indicating that the revision is minor, 15 or not  approved, the secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body  and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 14  See paragraph 181. 15  See paragraph 184.  17 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 87. If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft  recommendation that the proposed revised standardized baseline requires further input  from the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using  the “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”. The DNA should submit the  requested input within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the  “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request form”. If the DNA does not  provide the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing  the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised  standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume  processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the  DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the  submission shall be considered withdrawn. 88. The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed revised standardized baseline  be approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or not approved, the secretariat  may initiate a direct communication with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or  conference calls to clarify remaining issues. 89. The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input  and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend  that the proposed revised standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the  revision is major or minor, or not approved. The secretariat shall forward the revised draft  recommendation to the two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel for their  consideration. In this case, the steps in paragraphs 86 above or 90−93 below shall follow. 6.1.5. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel 90. If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the  draft recommendation or requests that it be considered by the Methodological Expert  Panel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert  Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed revised standardized  baseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is received at least  14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one. 91. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration within two meetings,  unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is  required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is  sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration at the meeting  immediately following receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, the  Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed revised  standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or  not approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory  Body and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 92. If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the  secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA  should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not  submit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing  the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised  standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume  processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the  18 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the  submission shall be considered withdrawn. 93. The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed revised  standardized baseline be approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or not  approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA and the  proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. 94. The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input  and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend  that the proposed revised standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the  revision is major or minor, or not approved. The secretariat shall forward the revised draft  recommendation to the Methodological Expert Panel for its final consideration. The  Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed revised  standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the revision is major or minor or  not approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory  Body and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 6.1.6. Preparation of draft revised standardized baseline 95. If the draft recommendation is to approve the proposed revised standardized baseline in  accordance with paragraphs 86, 91 or 94 above, the secretariat shall, before forwarding it  as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body, reformat the proposed revised  standardized baseline and send it to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel  members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered it last. Upon  receipt of an agreement on the reformatted revised standardized baseline from the two  selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological Expert Panel,  as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the reformatted revised standardized  baseline to the DNA and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or  request modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by  this deadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be  delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the reformatted revised standardized  baseline and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the  reformatted revised standardized baseline and the response from the DNA to the two  selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel,  whichever considered the draft recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the  response from the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall  finalize the reformatted revised standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the  Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the reformatted revised standardized baseline  at its next meeting, as applicable. 6.1.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 96. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation received in  accordance with paragraphs 86, 91 or 94 above within 28 days of receipt of the  recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision  adopted by the Supervisory Body. 97. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat  shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.  19 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 98. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days  prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the  Supervisory Body meeting after that one. 99. If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the  following courses of action at the meeting:  (a) Approve the proposed revised standardized baseline, indicating that:  (i) The revision is a major revision; or  (ii) The revision is a minor revision;  (b) Not approve the proposed revised standardized baseline;  (c) Continue the consideration of the proposed revised standardized baseline at the  next Supervisory Body meeting; or  (d) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation and  provide guidance on the issues for the review. 100. Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  DNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory  Body, as applicable, and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the  UNFCCC website. 101. If the proposed revised standardized baseline is not approved, the DNA may at any time  resubmit a proposed revised standardized baseline with revised documentation. Upon  submission of the revised documentation, the submission shall be treated as a new  submission of a proposed revised standardized baseline. 6.2. Top-down process 6.2.1. Initiation 102. The Supervisory Body may, taking into account the principles for revisions referred to in  appendix to this procedure, decide to revise an approved standardized baseline at any  time. If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved standardized baseline, the  Supervisory Body shall also decide to:  (a) Put on hold the approved standardized baseline with immediate effect. In this case,  DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,  any project design document (PDD) or programme of activities design document  (PoA-DD) for global stakeholder consultation, any request for registration or any  request for renewal of the crediting period of a project or PoA applying the  approved standardized baseline from the day following the date of publication of  the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the decision;  (b) Put on hold the approved standardized baseline with a grace period of 28 days. In  this case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC  website, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, any request for  registration or any request for renewal of the crediting period of a project or PoA  applying the approved standardized baseline more than 28 days following the date  of publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the decision; or  20 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  (c) Maintain the current version of the approved standardized baseline until the expiry  of its validity in accordance with section 9 below. 103. The Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat may at any time, taking into account  the principles for revisions referred to in appendix to this procedure, propose that the  Supervisory Body revise an approved standardized baseline. If the Methodological Expert  Panel or the secretariat considers that the current version of the approved standardized  baseline should be put on hold, it shall recommend so to the Supervisory Body. In these  cases, the Supervisory Body shall consider the proposal and/or the recommendation and  decide whether to revise and/or to put on hold the current version of the approved  standardized baseline in accordance with paragraph 102 above. 6.2.2. Preparation of a draft revised standardized baseline 104. If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved standardized baseline in  accordance with paragraphs 102 or 103 above, the secretariat shall communicate the  decision to the DNA of the Party for which a revised standardized baseline will be  proposed and seek its agreement to the initiation of the revision. Following receipt of the  agreement with the DNA using the “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision  agreement”, the secretariat shall prepare a draft revised standardized baseline  highlighting the proposed changes to the approved standardized baseline. 105. In preparing the draft revised standardized baseline, the secretariat may draw upon  external expertise, depending on the technical complexity of the revision and the  availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts  from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable and  available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the  roster. 106. The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward  the draft revised standardized baseline to them. 107. In preparing the draft revised standardized baselines, the secretariat and the selected  members of the Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group  referred to in paragraph 27 above. 6.2.3.

The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that the further input is still not sufficient to develop the draft revised standardized baseline,  the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA via e-mail or conference  calls to clarify remaining issues. 117. The secretariat shall revise the draft revised standardized baseline, taking into account  the further input and direct communication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat  shall forward the revised draft revised standardized baseline to the Methodological Expert  Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft  revised standardized baseline. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body  and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 6.2.5. Finalization of draft revised standardized baseline 118. Before forwarding the draft revised standardized baseline in accordance with  paragraphs 109, 114 or 117 above, the secretariat shall communicate the draft revised  standardized baseline to the DNA. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or request  modifications to it within 14 days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by this deadline,  the forwarding of the draft revised standardized baseline to the Supervisory Body may be  delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the draft revised standardized baseline  and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the draft  revised standardized baseline and the response from the DNA to the two selected  Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever  considered the draft revised standardized baseline last. In this case, taking into account  the response of the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall  finalize the draft revised standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the  Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft revised standardized baseline at its  next meeting, as applicable. 6.2.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 119. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the draft revised standardized  baseline received in accordance with paragraphs 109, 114 or 117 above within 28 days of  receipt of the draft revised standardized baseline, the draft revised standardized baseline  shall be deemed to be approved by the Supervisory Body. 120. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat  shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. 121. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the draft revised standardized  baseline more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be  placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed  on the agenda of the Supervisory Body meeting after that one. 122. If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the  following courses of action at the meeting:  (a) Approve the draft revised standardized baseline, indicating that:  (i) The revision is a major revision; or  23 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  (ii) The revision is a minor revision;  (b) Not approve the draft revised standardized baseline;  (c) Continue the consideration of the draft revised standardized baseline at the next  Supervisory Body meeting; or  (d) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the draft revised standardized  baseline and provide guidance on the issues for the review. 123. Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  DNA(s) of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory Body, as applicable,  and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 6.2.7. Other 124. The secretariat may propose an editorial revision to an approved standardized baseline at  any time. In this case, the secretariat shall submit a draft revised standardized baseline to  the Chair of the Supervisory Body for his/her review. If the Chair agrees to the draft revised  standardized baseline, the secretariat shall publish the revised standardized baseline on  the UNFCCC website. The editorial revision shall be noted in the report of the next meeting  of the Supervisory Body. 7. Clarification of a standardized baseline 7.1. Bottom-up process 7.1.1. Submission of request for clarification 125. The activity participants of a planned project or PoA, the coordinating/managing entity of  a planned PoA, a DOE, a DNA or any other stakeholder (hereinafter in section 7.1 referred  to as the enquirer) may, taking into account the principles for clarifications referred to in  appendix to this procedure, request clarification of an approved standardized baseline by  submitting the completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline clarification request” to  the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the UNFCCC  website. 7.1.2. Initial assessment 126. The secretariat shall give notice of the receipt of the request for clarification to the DNA of  a Party to which the approved standardized baseline applies within seven days of receipt. 127. The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:  Approved standardized baseline clarification request initial assessment” within 21 days of  receipt of the submission, to determine whether:  (a) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline clarification request”, including the  name and contact details of the enquirer, has been duly completed; and  (b) The submission is categorized as either:  (i) Involving no regulatory and/or technical ambiguity or only simple regulatory  and/or technical issues, hence requiring no analysis or only a simple analysis  to formulate a clarification; or  24 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  (ii) Involving complex regulatory and/or technical issues and/or having the  potential to apply to multiple versions of the approved standardized baseline,  hence requiring a thorough analysis to formulate a clarification. 128. If the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall request the enquirer to  submit the missing or revised documents and/or information. In this case, the enquirer  shall submit the requested documents and/or information to the secretariat within five days  of the receipt of the request. If the enquirer does not submit the requested documents  and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the submission is  incomplete. 129. Upon conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall notify the enquirer of the  conclusion of the initial assessment. If the submission is concluded as incomplete in  accordance with paragraph 128 above, the secretariat shall communicate the underlying  reasons to the enquirer. In this case, the enquirer may resubmit the request for clarification  with revised documentation at any time. Upon submission, the revised documentation  shall be treated as a new submission of a request for clarification under this procedure. 7.1.3. Fast track 130. If the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 127(i) above,  the secretariat shall prepare a clarification using the “Form: Approved standardized  baseline clarification response” and send it to the enquirer and the DNA within nine days  of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment. 131. In preparing the clarification, the secretariat may consult with the Methodological Expert  Panel. In this case, the timeline referred to in paragraph 130 above shall not apply. The  secretariat shall send a draft clarification to the Methodological Expert Panel within nine  days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment. If no member of the  Methodological Expert Panel objects to the draft clarification within seven days of receipt  of the draft clarification, the clarification shall be deemed finalized by the Methodological  Expert Panel. If a member of the Methodological Expert Panel objects to the draft  clarification, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the  Methodological Expert Panel. At the meeting where the case is placed on the agenda, the  Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to finalize the clarification within one  meeting. 132. The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website. 7.1.4. Regular track 133. If the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 127(ii) above,  the secretariat shall prepare a draft recommendation of a clarification to the  Methodological Expert Panel using the “Form: Approved standardized baseline  clarification response”. 134. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,  depending on the technical complexity of the issues in question and the availability of  expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts from the  Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable and available  experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the roster.  25 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 135. The secretariat shall select one member of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward  the draft recommendation to him/her for review. The selected member shall provide input  on the draft recommendation within three days of receipt. 136. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the  Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in  paragraph 27 above. 137. The secretariat may also forward the draft recommendation to the DNA for review. In this  case, the DNA shall provide input on the draft recommendation within seven days of  receipt. 138. The secretariat shall finalize the recommendation, taking into account the input from the  selected member and the DNA, as applicable, and submit it to the Methodological Expert  Panel for consideration. 139. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the recommendation, finalize the  recommendation and forward it to the Supervisory Body and publish it in its corresponding  meeting report, indicating the version(s) of the approved standardized baseline to which  the clarification applies. The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to  finalize the recommendation within one meeting. 140. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation above within 28  days of receipt of the recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be  deemed to be the decision adopted by the Supervisory Body. 141. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat  shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. 142. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days  prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the  Supervisory Body meeting after that one. 143. At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body  is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall decide to either:  (a) Approve the recommended clarification; or  (b) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the  Supervisory Body and provide guidance on the issues for review. 144. If the Supervisory Body approves the clarification, the secretariat shall send the finalized  clarification to the enquirer and the DNA. 145. The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website. 7.1.5. Other 146. At any step before the clarification is finalized in accordance with paragraphs 130, 131 or  (a) above, the secretariat may request the enquirer to provide additional information  regarding the request for clarification within a defined time frame to facilitate the  assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert  26 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  Panel. If such information significantly affects the outcome of the consideration, the  secretariat shall make the information publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 7.2. Top-down process 147. If the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert Panel, or the secretariat finds it  necessary, taking into account the principles for clarifications referred to in appendix to  this procedure, to clarify provisions of an approved standardized baseline, the process to  revise the approved standardized baseline as defined in section 6.2 shall be followed. In  this case, the draft revised standardized baseline shall incorporate all relevant  clarifications issued prior to the revision. 8. Update of a standardized baseline 8.1. Bottom-up process 8.1.1. Submission of a proposed updated standardized baseline 148. A proponent may propose an updated standardized baseline through the DNA of the Party  for which the updated standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, the proponent shall  ensure that the proposed updated standardized baseline complies16 with the “Standard:  Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines”, including the  requirements related to the data coverage period, data currentness and the validity of  standardized baselines. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed updated  standardized baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs149‒151 below. 149. The DNA submitting the proposed updated standardized baseline shall submit the  following documentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made  available on the UNFCCC website between 270 to 180 days prior to the date when the  validity of the current standardized baseline expires:17  (a) The completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”;  (b) The proposed updated standardized baseline, highlighting the proposed changes  to the approved standardized baseline;  (c) A spreadsheet 18 containing all data used and the calculations performed for the  establishment of the proposed updated standardized baseline;  (d) A quality control report prepared in accordance with the “Guideline: Quality  assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized  baselines”;  (e) An assessment report on the proposed updated standardized baseline containing  the information referred to in paragraph 17 above and prepared in accordance with  paragraph 150 below. 16  Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification when proposing  an update of an approved standardized baseline. 17  Any delay in the submission from this time frame may create a gap period between the expiry of the  current standardized baseline and the entry-into-force of the updated standardized baseline. For the  requirement for addressing such gap period, see section 9 below. 18  In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format.  27 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  (a) All additional documentation supporting the submission (e.g. statistics and/or,  studies etc.), where applicable;  (b) Letter of approval on the proposed updated standardized baseline from the DNA. 150. In cases where no new or additional data were required to establish the proposed updated  standardized baseline:  (a) The documentation referred to in paragraph (d) above is not required to be  submitted;  (b) The assessment report referred to in paragraph 1(e) above does not need to  include a positive assessment opinion on the compliance of the quality assurance  and quality control system referred to in paragraph 17(a) above. Consequently, the  assessment report only needs to include a positive assessment opinion that the  proposed standardized baseline meets the requirements of one of the approaches  referred to in paragraph 17(b) above. 151. The assessment report referred to in paragraph 1(e) above may be prepared by a DOE  contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other entity under agreement with the  DNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be prepared by a DOE with funding support  in accordance with the modalities described in appendix 1 to this procedure. 152. The secretariat shall make every effort to inform the DNA in advance of the period for  requesting update of the approved standardized baseline. It remains the responsibility of  the DNA to ensure that all actions are taken in accordance with this section of the  procedure in a timely manner. 153. The Supervisory Body may, upon request from the DNA, decide to request the secretariat  to provide technical support to the DNA for the preparation of the request without prejudice  to the outcome of the subsequent request. 154. No fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed updated  standardized baseline. 8.1.2. Initial assessment 155. The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:  Approved standardized baseline update request initial assessment” within 21 days of  receipt of the submission. The secretariat shall assess whether:  (a) The DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 149 and  150 above;  (b) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”, including the name  and contact details of the proponent, has been duly completed;  (c) The proposed updated standardized baseline was derived from the same  approach as the one used in the approved standardized baseline that is being  proposed for an update;  (d) The proposed updated standardized baseline, if developed using the approach  referred to in paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above, does not require revision to the  underlying approved methodology or methodological tool. If it requires such  revision, the secretariat shall propose that the Board carry out the revision through  28 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  the top-down process in accordance with the “Procedure: development, revision  and clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological  tools”;  (e) The assessment report includes positive assessment opinion in accordance with  paragraph 17 above. 156. The secretariat shall inform the DNA and the proponent of the outcome of the initial  assessment. If the secretariat finds that the required documentation or information is  incomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA  should provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification. 157. The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of receipt of missing  documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion of the  initial assessment. If the DNA does not provide the missing documents or information  within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission and ascertain  from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed updated standardized baseline  continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as  soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if the DNA does  not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the initial notification,  the submission shall be considered withdrawn. 158. Upon successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall assign a  reference number to the proposed updated standardized baseline and make the submitted  documentation publicly available on the UNFCCC website with the exception of  information declared confidential and/or proprietary by the DNA. Aggregated data and  information used to derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential  or proprietary. 8.1.3. Preparation of a draft recommendation 159. Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall  prepare a draft recommendation on the proposed updated standardized baseline using  either:  (a) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline update recommendation” for the  recommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 160(a) or 160(c) below;  or  (b) The “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request” for the recommended  course of action referred to in paragraph 160(b) below. 160. The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of  action:  (a) Approve the proposed updated standardized baseline;  (b) Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted  documentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or  (c) Not approve the proposed updated standardized baseline. 161. In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,  depending on the technical complexity of the proposed updated standardized baseline  and the availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external  29 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  experts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable  and available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the  roster. 162. The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward  its draft recommendation to them. 8.1.4. Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel 163. The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of  receipt of the draft recommendation, independently assess the proposed updated  standardized baseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the  outcome of their assessment. 164. If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft  recommendation to approve or not to approve the proposed updated standardized  baseline, the secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body  and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 165. If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft  recommendation that the proposed updated standardized baseline requires further input  from the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using  the “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”. The DNA should submit the  requested input within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the  “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”. If the DNA does not provide the  requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the  submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized  baseline continue to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the  submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the DNA does not  provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the submission shall  be considered withdrawn. 166. The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed updated standardized baseline  be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the  DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. 167. The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input  and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend  that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The  secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the two selected members  of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration. In this case, the steps in  paragraphs 164 or 168−172 below shall follow. 8.1.5. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel 168. If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the  draft recommendation or requests that it be considered by the Methodological Expert  Panel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert  Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed updated  standardized baseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is  received at least 14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the  meeting after that one.  30 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 169. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration within two meetings,  unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is  required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is  sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration at the meeting  immediately following receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, the  Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed updated  standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The secretariat shall forward  it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly available on the  UNFCCC website. 170. If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the  secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA  should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not  submit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing  the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed  standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume  processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the  DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the  submission shall be considered withdrawn. 171. The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds  that the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed updated  standardized baseline be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct  communication with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify  remaining issues. 172. The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input  and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend  that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The  secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert  Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to  recommend that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not  approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body  and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. 8.1.6. Preparation of draft updated standardized baseline 173. If the draft recommendation is to approve the proposed updated standardized baseline in  accordance with paragraphs 164, 169 or 172 above, the secretariat shall, before  forwarding it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body, reformat the proposed  updated standardized baseline and send it to the two selected Methodological Expert  Panel members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered it last. Upon  receipt of an agreement on the reformatted updated standardized baseline from the two  selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological Expert Panel,  as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the reformatted updated standardized  baseline to the DNA and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or  request modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by  this deadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be  delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the reformatted updated standardized  baseline and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the  reformatted updated standardized baseline and the response from the DNA to the two  selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel,  whichever considered the draft recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the  31 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  response from the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall  finalize the reformatted updated standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the  Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the reformatted updated standardized baseline  at its next meeting, as applicable. 8.1.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body 174. If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation received in  accordance with paragraphs 164, 169 or 172 above within 28 days of receipt of the  recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision  adopted by the Supervisory Body. 175. An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair  of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat  shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. 176. If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days  prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the  next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the  Supervisory Body meeting after that one. 177. If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the  following courses of action at the meeting:  (a) Approve the proposed updated standardized baseline;  (b) Not approve the proposed updated standardized baseline;  (c) Continue the consideration of the proposed baseline at the next Supervisory Body  meeting; or  (d) Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation and  provide guidance on the issues for the review. 178. Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the  DNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory  Body, as applicable, and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the  UNFCCC website. 179. If the proposed updated standardized baseline is not approved, the DNA may at any time  resubmit a proposed updated standardized baseline with revised documentation. Upon  submission of the revised documentation, the submission shall be treated as a new  submission of a proposed updated standardized baseline. 9. Validity of new, updated and revised standardized  baselines 180. The reference number of an approved new standardized baseline shall indicate the year  when the standardized baseline comes into force. The approved new or revised  standardized baseline shall come into force from the date as indicated in the approved  new or revised standardized baseline. From this date, a project or PoA may apply the  approved new or revised standardized baseline for the purpose of publishing a PDD or  PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a request for registration, or  submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA period, in accordance with  32 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1  the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of  activities”. The approved new or revised standardized baseline shall be valid for the period  indicated in the approved new or revised standardized baseline. The validity period of a  standardized baseline does not change due to a revision. 181. The year indicated in the reference number of an approved standardized baseline shall  be replaced by the year when an updated standardized baseline comes into force if the  Supervisory Body approves the updated standardized baseline in accordance with  paragraph 177(a) above. The version number of the updated standardized baseline shall  also be reset to 01.0 (e.g. from 02.1 to 01.0). The updated standardized baseline shall  come into force from the date as indicated in the updated standardized baseline for the  purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a  request for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA  period, in accordance with the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle  procedure for programmes of activities”. If, after the publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for  global stakeholder consultation, the applied standardized baseline has expired and an  updated standardized baseline is available at the time of submission of a request for  registration or renewal, the activity participants or the coordinating/managing entity shall  revise the PDD or PoA-DD applying the updated standardized baseline. If, after the  publication of the PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, the applied  standardized baseline has expired and no valid updated standardized baseline is available  at the time of submission of a request for registration or renewal, the activity participants  or the coordinating/managing entity shall revise the PDD or PoA-DD replacing the  standardized baseline with the corresponding parameter values calculated by themselves  in accordance with the applied methodology and/or applicable methodological tool. In  these cases, the DOE shall not publish the revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder  consultation but shall submit it when it submits a request for registration unless otherwise  decided by the Supervisory Body when it approves the updated standardized baseline.  The updated standardized baseline shall be valid for the period indicated in the approved  updated standardized baseline. 182. If the entry into force of an updated standardized baseline is not immediately after the  expiry of its previous version, thus creating a gap period in the validity of the two  consecutive versions of the standardized baseline, the activity participants and the  coordinating/managing entities shall, for the purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for  global stakeholder consultation, submitting a request for registration, or submitting a  request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA period, in accordance with the “Activity  cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”,  choose one of the following options for calculating baseline emissions for such gap period:  (a) Determine the parameter values in accordance with the applied methodology  and/or applicable methodological tool;  (b) Use the more conservative value between the previous and the updated  standardized baseline. 183. The version number of an approved standardized baseline shall increase by one whole  number (e.g. from 01.0 to 02.0) if the Supervisory Body approves a revised standardized  baseline indicating that it is a major revision in accordance with paragraphs 99(i) or 122(i)  above.

Funding modalities for the preparation of  assessment reports for establishing  standardized baselines 1. A designated national authority (DNA) for the the Article 6.4 mechanism may engage a  designated operational entity (DOE) to prepare an assessment report using its own  resources or with the funding support from the secretariat. The latter is subject to  availability of funds. 2. The Supervisory Body shall determine the total amount of funding available for such  funding support and the period for which the funding is made available. The Board may  also determine a ceiling on the fund available for the preparation of each assessment  report. 3. The secretariat or its contractual partner UN organization (e.g., The United Nations Office  for Project Services) will conduct a procurement exercise with eligible and interested  DOEs and have a framework contract with the selected DOEs. 4. The DNA that wishes to receive support from the secretariat for the preparation of the  assessment report may request support by submitting a duly completed “Request for  funding for assessment report form” to the secretariat. 5. Within 21 days of receipt of the submission from the DNA, the secretariat shall confirm  whether the funding is available and whether the submission is complete. 6. If the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall inform the DNA  accordingly and request it to submit any missing documents or information to the  secretariat within 10 days. 7. If the missing documents or information are not submitted within the deadline referred to  in paragraph 6 of this appendix, the secretariat shall suspend processing the request for  funding until it receives the missing documents or information. 8. Once the submission is considered complete, subject to availability of funds, the  secretariat or another UN entity under agreement with the secretariat shall make a  contractual arrangement with the DOE. 9. The DOE shall prepare an assessment report according to the timeline agreed. 10. Once the standardized baseline is submitted and considered complete, the secretariat  shall make arrangements through its contractual partner to disburse the funds to the DOE.  35 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 Appendix 2. Principles for the revision and clarification of  standardized baselines 1. Background 1. This appendix provides guiding principles for initiating a revision to an approved  standardized baseline and for initiating a (request for) clarification of an approved  standardized baseline. 2. Principle for revision 2. A revision is the modification of an approved standardized baseline in order to improve it  or broaden its scope and applicability. 3. A revision of an approved standardized baseline may be initiated if one or more of the  following conditions apply:  (a) New or generally accepted scientific evidence indicates that emission reductions  or removal enhancements will be overestimated or underestimated based on the  approved standardized baseline or that the reductions or enhancements may not  be real, measurable and verifiable;  (b) The applicability conditions require broadening to include more potential project  activity types or conditions for use;  (c) There are identified inconsistencies, errors and/or ambiguities in the language  and/or formulae used within the approved standardized baseline;  (d) Further simplification (e.g. default values) is required to improve the user-  friendliness of the approved standardized baseline;  (e) Key issues clarified through a request for clarification of the approved standardized  baseline in accordance with section 7 of (the main part of) this procedure are  required to be incorporated in the approved standardized baseline;  (f) There are changes to the additionality demonstration, baseline and/or baseline  emission factors as determined in the approved standardized baseline. 3. Principles for clarification 4. A clarification on an approved standardized baseline is to clarify:  (a) The applicability of the approved standardized baseline;  (b) Various procedures provided in the approved standardized baseline, inter alia, for  identifying the baseline scenario, demonstrating additionality and estimating  baseline emission factors; or  (c) Monitoring data and procedures provided in the approved standardized baseline.  36 of 37  A6.4-PROC-METH-002 Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines Version 01.1 5. A clarification on an approved standardized baseline may be requested if:  (a) Any of the provisions of the approved standardized baseline are unclear or  ambiguous, and there is room for interpretation of the provisions; and/or  (b) Rationale or further background information is needed regarding conditions under  which the approved standardized baseline is to be applied.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.1 6 October 2024 Corrective revision to paragraph 7 of sub-section 2.3, Entry into  Force.  01.0 13 July 2023 SB 006, Annex 5  Initial adoption.

Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism).1 Chapter XI.A of the RMPs contains provisions that allow  transition of project activities and programmes of activities (PoAs) registered under the  clean development mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol or listed as  provisional as per the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Board of the CDM 2  (hereinafter referred to as provisional requests) to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated key conditions and processes for such  transition.3 At the same session, the CMA also requested4 the Supervisory Body to  facilitate the tasks related to the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism  by:  (a) Developing and operationalizing a procedure for requesting transition, which  includes relevant forms, by no later than June 2023;  (b) Developing and operationalizing the transition process and reporting back to the  CMA at its fifth session. 3. The CMA, at its sixth session,5 decided that afforestation and reforestation project  activities and programmes of activities registered under the CDM may transition to the  Article 6.4 mechanism and be registered as Article 6.4 activities. The CMA also elaborated  key conditions for such a transition. 4. Pursuant to its mandate from the CMA to operationalize the transition process, the  Supervisory Body has adopted the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article  6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) as contained in this document  and the “Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter  referred to as the transition procedure) and relevant forms. 5. The Supervisory Body at its 16th meeting agreed to provisions on avoidance of double  issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities. The Supervisory  Body further decided to require the use of re-evaluated values for the fraction of non- 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10a01E.pdf . 2 At its 108th meeting (see paragraphs 7‒8 of the meeting report) and later clarified in the document entitled  “Clarification: Regulatory requirements under temporary measures for post-2020 cases” available at  http://cdm.unfccc.int/sunsetcms/storage/contents/stored-file-20220314132358671/Reg_Clar03v02.pdf. 3 Decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapter I, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/10/Add.2  available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_10a02E.pdf . 4 Decision 7/CMA.4, paragraph 23. 5 Decision -/CMA.6 \"Further guidance on the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the  Paris Agreement” (Advance unedited version), Section VI.

Methodology 22. A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism may continue to apply the currently applied CDM methodology until the earlier  of the end of the current crediting period or PoA period as applicable, or 31 December  2025. After that date, it shall apply an Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter  referred to as mechanism methodology). 23. For a CDM project activity or CPA with the fixed crediting period type, if the replacement  of the currently applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology is due before  the end of the current crediting period under the Article 6.4 mechanism, such replacement  shall be made through the post-registration change process applicable to any new A6.4  activities. 24. Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 22 above, if the currently applied CDM  methodology does not meet the methodological requirements that may be specified by the  host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, it shall be replaced with a  mechanism methodology. 25. A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, may voluntarily replace the currently  applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology at transition. Also, they may  be required to do so in accordance with paragraph 24 above. In these cases, the project  design document, or PoA design document and CPA design documents, shall be revised  by the project participant, validated by a designated operational entity, and approved by  the Supervisory Body in accordance with the transition procedure. 26. For a transitioning CDM PoA,:  (a) If the PoA continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition  in accordance with paragraph 22 above, no new CPA may be included in the PoA  until the PoA period is renewed under the Article 6.4 mechanism applying a  mechanism methodology;  (b) The mandatory replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a  mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 24 above shall be made to both  the PoA and the CPAs therein at transition;  (c) If the voluntary replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a  mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 25 above takes place at the PoA  level at transition, any new CPAs that may be included after the transition shall  apply the mechanism methodology, while the existing CPAs may choose to  continue applying the currently applied CDM methodology until the earlier of the  end of their respective current crediting periods or 31 December 2025, or switch to  the mechanism methodology at transition;  7 of 14  A6.4-STAN-AC-001 Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 04.0  (d) If the voluntary replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a  mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 25 above takes place for any of  the existing CPAs at transition, such voluntary replacement shall also take place  at the PoA level at transition. 27. A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism are in compliance with the requirement of paragraph 31(a) of the RMPs  regarding additionality of their mitigation of GHG emissions as long as they continue to  apply the CDM methodology in accordance with paragraph 22 above. If the CDM  methodology is replaced with a mechanism methodology mandatorily or voluntarily,  additionality shall be demonstrated in accordance with the relevant requirements  applicable to any new A6.4 activities. 28. In addition to the provisions in paragraph 27 above afforestation and reforestation CDM  project activities, or PoAs and CPAs therein that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism shall comply with the applicable requirements for activities involving removals  under the mechanism, as contained in the Supervisory Body “Standard: Requirements for  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. 29. CDM A/R projects, PoAs and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism shall comply with the following elements of the “Standard: Requirements for  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”:  (a) Identification of risk of reversals: This shall include identification and justification of  the risks of reversals that may be attributed to the A/R CDM project activity, or A/R  CDM PoA and A/R CPAs therein, aligned with the provisions of the “Standard:  Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”  and other applied methodological regulatory documents approved by the  Supervisory Body. The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to:  (i) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity  costs;  (ii) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal  risks, acts of terrorism, crime, and war;  (iii) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and  geological faults and fractures;  (iv) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks.  (b) Reversal risk assessment: This assessment shall be undertaken in accordance  with the provisions of the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals  under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applied methodological regulatory  documents approved by the Supervisory Body. The assessment shall calculate an  overall percentage-based risk rating that accounts for both avoidable and  unavoidable reversals, taking into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude,  likelihood, and duration of the risks;  (c) Reversal risk mitigation plan: If a risk of non-permanence is identified, the project  participants shall develop and implement a risk mitigation plan, aligned with the  corresponding eligibility criteria, to address any risks identified through the reversal  risk assessment. This plan shall follow the relevant provisions of the “Standard:  Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”  8 of 14  A6.4-STAN-AC-001 Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 04.0  and other applied methodological regulatory documents approved by the  Supervisory Body;  (d) Remediation of reversals: The project participants shall describe the measures to  be implemented to remediate reversals aligned with the corresponding eligibility  criteria, including proactive measures to mitigate reversal risks and avoid  reversals, as per the requirements of the “Standard: Requirements for activities  involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applied  methodological regulatory documents approved by the Supervisory Body;  (e) Post-crediting period monitoring plan: The project participants shall describe the  monitoring to be conducted after the end of the last active crediting period of the  A/R CDM project activity, or A/R CDM PoA and A/R CPAs therein, to assess  whether any reversals have occurred. This monitoring shall be in accordance with  the requirements of the selected methodology and/or standardized baseline, the  provisions of the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under  the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applied methodological regulatory  documents approved by the Supervisory Body. 6.3.

The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The Supervisory Body, at its ninth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 activity standard for  projects” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that sets out the requirements relating  to the design, implementation and other attributes of Article 6.4 mechanism projects (A6.4  projects). 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of  Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies  standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article  6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article  6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two  standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas  the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have  met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental  risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to  sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of  the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). 5. The Supervisory Body, at its fifteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Demonstration of  additionality for mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the additionality  standard) that sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to  demonstrating additionality. 1.2. Objectives 6. The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to the design,  implementation and other attributes of A6.4 projects. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex A available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. 2 Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a). 3 Decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapters III‒VI.

It does not apply to distributed unit projects in  which the project boundary consists of a region. 8 Examples of “types and levels of services” include the amount of a certain type of cement produced or  the amount of electricity fed into the electricity grid.  7 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 6.3. Double or revived registration 17. The activity participants shall confirm that the proposed A6.4 project is none of the  following:  (a) Already registered as an A6.4 project;  (b) Already included as a component project (CP) in a registered Article 6.4  mechanism programme of activities (A6.4 PoA);  (c) Previously deregistered from the Article 6.4 mechanism. 18. Additionally, the activity participants shall confirm one of the following:  (a) The proposed A6.4 project is not currently registered or being pursued for  registration, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional,  national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme;  (b) The proposed A6.4 project was previously registered under or covered by a  programme under any other international, regional, national, or subnational or  sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme but deregistered or excluded from  the other crediting scheme before fully exhausting the crediting period under the  other crediting scheme;  (c) The proposed A6.4 project is currently registered or covered by other international,  regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme. 19. For the cases described in paragraph 18(b) above, the activity participants shall obtain a  confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of deregistration or  exclusion and the remaining crediting period under the other crediting scheme at the time  of deregistration or exclusion. 20. For the cases described in paragraph 18(c) above, the activity participants shall obtain a  confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of the registration or  coverage, the start and end dates of the crediting period, and the monitoring periods for  which credits have been issued under the other crediting scheme. 21. If the proposed A6.4 project was a CP that has been excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA,  the activity participants shall ensure that:  (a) The PDD transparently declares that the project was a CP that has been previously  excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to erroneous  inclusion;  (b) The crediting period type (i.e., renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting  period are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of  the exclusion. A6.4ERs may be claimed for the period only after the effective date  of registration as an A6.4 project, as per the activity cycle procedure, and:  (i) If the crediting period is renewable, the request for registration shall be  submitted by the validating DOE within one year of the end date of the  crediting period valid for the CP at the time of the exclusion. Missing this  deadline precludes the submission of the request for registration;  (ii) If the crediting period is fixed, the request for registration shall be submitted  by the validating DOE prior to the end date of the crediting period valid for  8 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  the CP at the time of the exclusion. Missing this deadline precludes the  submission of the request for registration;  (c) The project meets all relevant registration requirements of projects valid at the time  of submission of the request for registration as an A6.4 project;  (d) If the project applies a methodology that potentially accrues negative GHG  emission reductions, GHG emission reductions have been continuously monitored  in accordance with the monitoring plan as described in the CP design document  (CP-DD) and verified by a DOE since the end of the monitoring period in the last  published monitoring report that covered the CP, including the exclusion period.  For such project, if net negative GHG emission reductions occurred during the  period before the registration as an A6.4 project, the equivalent amount shall be  deducted from the first requests for issuance of A6.4ERs after the registration;  (e) If the CP has been excluded due to erroneous inclusion and if A6.4ERs were  issued for the CP, an equivalent amount of A6.4ERs have been compensated by  the DOE that included the CP, to the Article 6.4 mechanism registry in accordance  with the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. 22. The activity participants shall declare, if applicable, the existence of a registered A6.4  project, CP under a registered A6.4 PoA or an activity under any other international,  regional, national or subnational GHG mitigation crediting scheme whose crediting period  has or has not expired (hereinafter referred to as former project) in the same geographical  location as that of the proposed A6.4 project. 23. If the activity participants identify that the proposed A6.4 project is in the same  geographical location as that of a former project, they shall declare that the proposed A6.4  project will not lead to the discontinuation or modification of the former project and does  not decrease the levels of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals by the former  project, and that the proposed A6.4 project complies with the following conditions:  (a) It utilizes both different measure and a different technology(ies), technique(s)  and/or resource(s) from those of the former project;  (b) It does not share or utilize any of the assets of the former project;  (c) It utilizes a different resource type compared to the former project. 24. The following definitions shall apply for paragraph 23 above:  (a) Measure: fuel/feedstock switch, technology switch, methane destruction and  methane avoidance;  (b) Technology: equipment or conversion process used for the production of goods or  provision of services. Two technologies are considered to be the same  technologies if they:  (i) Provide the same kind of output and use the same kind of equipment and  conversion process; or  (ii) Undertake the same course of action that results in the same kind of effect;  (c) Assets: resources with economic value that an individual, corporation or country  owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide future benefit; the assets  could be physical, such as project equipment, or non-corporeal such as permits  9 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  and exclusive position in legislation. The definition of assets in this context  excludes land;  (d) Output: amount of goods or services produced by a technology;  (e) Resource: a source of supply or support needed for the production of an output. It  may include categories of goods, energy and energy carriers that are supplied into  the project location and are required for the implementation of the project /CP, such  as fossil fuel, by-product of a process, biomass, solar, wind and geothermal heat. 25. If the proposed A6.4 project involves the implementation of distributed units in households  and the conditions in paragraph 23(a)−(c) above are not met, the activity participants shall  request a DOE to validate and confirm by other means that the project will not lead to the  discontinuation or modification of the former project, and does not decrease the GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals by the former project, in accordance with the  “Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects” (hereinafter referred as the  validation and verification standard). 26. In all other cases, the activity participants may submit a communication to the Supervisory  Body to request clarification prior to the submission of a request for registration. 6.4. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 27. The activity participants shall select valid9 methodologies that have been approved by the  Supervisory Body, applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and, if applicable, are  compatible with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party  in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 28. In selecting a methodology for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants may, in  accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies  and methodological tools\":  (a) Propose a new methodology;  (b) Propose a revision to an approved methodology;  (c) Seek clarification on the applicability of an approved methodology; or  (d) Request approval of deviation from an approved methodology or methodological  tool. 29. The activity participants may select a standardized baseline that has been approved by  the Supervisory Body if it is valid10 and applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and to the  selected methodology in accordance with the applicability section of the standardized  baseline (hereinafter referred to as selected standardized baseline). 9 The valid version of a methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission of the  request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat in accordance with the activity  cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version, for use in accordance with the  “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”. 10 The valid version of a standardized baseline is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission  of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat in accordance with the  activity cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance with  the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.  10 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 30. Notwithstanding paragraph 29 above, the activity participants shall select an approved  standardized baseline for the proposed A6.4 project if the standardized baseline is valid,  applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and to the selected methodology, and the selection  of the standardized baseline is mandatory in accordance with the applicability section of  the standardized baseline11 or required by the host Party in accordance with paragraph  27(a) of the RMPs.12 31. In selecting a standardized baseline for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants  may, in accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update  of standardized baselines” (hereinafter referred to as the standardized baseline  procedure):  (a) Propose a new standardized baseline;  (b) Propose a revision to an approved standardized baseline;  (c) Seek clarification of an approved standardized baseline; or  (d) Propose an updated standardized baseline. 6.5. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 6.5.1. General requirements 32. The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC  reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized  baselines that are applied to the proposed A6.4 project, including any other methodologies  or methodological tools to which the selected methodologies refer. 33. The activity participants shall demonstrate why the selected methodologies, standardized  baselines, and any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines  applied in accordance with the selected methodologies (hereinafter, “any other standards,  methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines (to be) applied in accordance with the  selected (applied) methodologies” are collectively referred to as the other applied  methodological regulatory documents) are applicable to the proposed A6.4 project. This  shall be done by showing that the project meets all applicability conditions of these  regulatory documents and, if applicable, is compatible with the methodological  requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)  of the RMPs. 34. The activity participants shall ensure that the proposed A6.4 project complies with all the  requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and other  applied methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological  requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)  of the RMPs. 11 The date when the selection of a standardized baseline becomes mandatory is to be determined in  accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update of standardized  baselines”. 12 Such standardized baselines may, for example, state in their applicability section that the latest approved  and valid values of the standardized baseline are the only values of the carbon dioxide emission factor(s)  that shall be applied for the project electricity system.  11 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 6.5.2. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases 35. The activity participants shall describe the project boundary of the proposed A6.4 project,  including the physical delineation of the project using GPS coordinates where appropriate.  The activity participants shall further specify which sources, sinks and GHGs are included  within the project boundary, in accordance with the applied methodologies and the applied  standardized baselines. In this context, project boundary is the physical delineation or  geographical area that encompasses sources, sinks and GHGs under the control of the  activity participants, which are significant and reasonably attributable to the project in  accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable, the applied  standardized baselines. 36. If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity  participants to choose whether a source, sink or GHG is to be included in the project  boundary, the activity participants shall explain and justify their choice. 6.5.3. Baseline scenario 37. The activity participants shall establish and describe the baseline scenario for the  proposed A6.4 project in accordance with: the applied methodologies; standardized  baselines; a more ambitious baseline requirement determined by the host Party and  approved by the Supervisory Body; other applied methodological regulatory documents;  and the provisions outlined in paragraphs 38–42 below and, where applicable, the  baseline approaches specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of  the RMPs. 38. The activity participants shall provide information on the facilities, systems and equipment  to be operated both under the proposed A6.4 project and the baseline scenario. 39. When establishing the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee that future  anthropogenic emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to  specific circumstances in the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed  demand in the applied methodology or propose a revision to an approved methodology to  cover such scenario if it is not covered in the methodology. 40. In case of replacement of existing equipment, the activity participants shall estimate the  point in time when the existing equipment would be replaced in the absence of the  proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the guidance on determining the remaining  lifetime of equipment in the applied methodology if applicable. 41. If the proposed A6.4 project is registered under or covered by another international,  regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the most  conservative baseline scenario between that is required by the applied methodology and  that is set under such other crediting scheme, in accordance with guidance to be provided  by the Supervisory Body. 42. Notwithstanding paragraphs 37‒41 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an  approved standardized baseline that standardizes baseline scenario, the activity  participants shall describe the baseline scenario as per the applied standardized baseline.  12 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 6.5.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 43. The activity participants shall identify and describe the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario  or reference benchmark emissions for the proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the  applied methodologies or other applied methodological regulatory documents. 6.5.5. Demonstration of additionality 44. The activity participants shall demonstrate, in accordance with the applied methodologies,  other applied methodological regulatory documents, and the requirements related to prior  consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in section 6.1 above, that the  proposed A6.4 project would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the  Article 6.4 mechanism. 45. Activity participants shall ensure that additionality is demonstrated for an A6.4 project in  its entirety and is not separately demonstrated for different parts of an A6.4 project,13  unless the different parts can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect  each other.14 46. Additionality shall be demonstrated following the requirements for demonstration of  additionality included in the applied methodologies, using a robust assessment that shows  the project would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism.  This assessment should be made, taking into account all relevant national policies,  including legislation, and represent mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required  by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that avoids locking in levels of  emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with paragraph 33 of  the RMPs. 47. Activity participants shall, in accordance with the applied methodologies, demonstrate  additionality using the appropriate approaches for demonstration of additionality, including  regulatory analysis, analysis of lock-in risk, investment analysis, barrier analysis, common  practice analysis and performance-based approach. 48. For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the  PDD as part of the investment analysis. 6.5.6. Addressing non-permanence for projects involving removals and emission  reduction projects with reversal risks 49. For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  activity participants shall, in the PDD, identify and assess the risks of reversals, aligned  with the provisions of the removals standard and other applied methodological regulatory  documents approved by the Supervisory Body, and conduct the risk assessment in  accordance with the applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 50. The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to: 13 For example, if a project involves the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the landfill gas for  energy generation, additionality should be demonstrated for both parts together, and not separately for  the landfill gas capture part and for the energy generation part. 14 For example, if the project involves the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the  catalytic abatement of N2O emissions at a nitric acid production plant.  13 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (a) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity costs;  (b) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,  acts of terrorism, crime and war;  (c) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and geological  faults and fractures;  (d) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. 51. The risk assessment shall include:  (a) A risk mitigation plan using the reversal risk assessment tool to be developed by  the Supervisory Body to identify, assess and mitigate reversal risks; and  (b) The calculation of an overall percentage-based risk rating (hereinafter referred to  as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals, taking  into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood and duration of the risks. 52. The risk assessment shall be reviewed and revised by activity participants and verified by  a DOE every five years from the start of the first crediting period and in any of the  circumstances referred to in paragraph 72 below. 6.5.7. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals 53. The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex-post calculation of  baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by the proposed A6.4 project. The activity  participants shall also provide the ex-ante calculation of those for each year of the crediting  period, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines  and other applied methodological regulatory documents. If the proposed A6.4 project  contains more than one component, the activity participants shall apply this requirement  for each component separately. The activity participants shall describe all steps to be  undertaken for these calculations and provide all results. 54. For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the estimation of  removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the PDD in accordance with the  methodology(ies) applicable to the project. 55. The activity participants shall calculate the difference between baseline emissions and  BAU emissions for each year of the crediting period and the total amount over the crediting  period to determine a downward adjustment based on BAU. 56. The activity participants shall determine whether the baseline must be adjusted downward  as per the guidance below:  (a) The activity participants shall describe in the PDD the factors and quantitative  methods for downward adjustment and update them at each renewal of the  crediting period in accordance with paragraphs 55 above and 56(b) below. Activity  participants shall also apply more stringent factors or quantitative methods  determined by the host Parties for downward adjustment, according to their  circumstances;  14 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers the  economic viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and  decarbonization technologies, and negative emission approaches while ensuring  that methodologies are aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris  Agreement, and may be operationalized through:  (i) Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies  approved by the Supervisory Body that may be proposed by activity  participants or stakeholders;15  (ii) Factors or quantitative methods jointly developed by the Supervisory Body  and the host Party;  (iii) Factors or quantitative methods developed by the host Party that are  specified to the Supervisory Body for approval;  (c) If the downward adjustment based on the BAU referred to in paragraph 55 above  is greater than the downward adjustment determined based on paragraphs 56(a)  and 56(b) above, no further adjustment to the baseline is required; otherwise  further adjustment is required to align with the result of paragraphs 56(a) and 56(b)  above to ensure consistency with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMPs,  in accordance with other applied methodological regulatory documents. 57. The activity participants shall determine the leakage emissions in the PDD as follows:  (a) Identify all potential sources of leakage that may reasonably be attributable to the  activity following the applicable methodology and other applied methodological  regulatory documents. If any of the sources of leakage is excluded from  consideration, proper justification shall be provided;  (b) Describe how each of the sources of leakage identified above will be avoided or  minimized and accounted for, following the applicable methodology and other  applied methodological regulatory documents;  (c) Take into account relevant information from the designated national authority  (DNA) of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 58. If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied  methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide  different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify  their choice. 59. To determine the performance of the equipment used in the proposed A6.4 project, when  required for calculating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the activity  participants shall use: 15 Activity participants or stakeholders may propose factors or quantitative methods for the consideration  of the Supervisory Body in consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being  involved. If a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the \"Procedure:  Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\" shall be applied. See here  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-METH-002.pdf  15 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (a) The appropriate values, or the values calculated based on the methods specified  in the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and other applied  methodological regulatory documents;  (b) The national standard for the performance of the equipment type, identifying the  standard used, if the values referred to in subparagraph (a) above are not  available;  (c) An international standard for the performance of the equipment type, such as  International Standardization Organization (ISO) or International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC) standards with the identification of the standard used, if the  values referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above are not available;  (d) The manufacturer’s specifications, provided they are tested and certified by  national or international certifiers, if the values referred to in subparagraphs (a)−(c)  above are not available;  (e) Performance data from test results conducted by an independent entity for the  equipment to be installed under the project, if the values referred to in  subparagraphs (a)−(d) above are not available. 60. The activity participants shall use the valid version of the norms, specifications, standards  and test procedures referred to in the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents, as available at the time  of submission of the request for registration. 61. The activity participants shall provide the data and parameters that will not be monitored  but are determined before the registration of the proposed A6.4 project and remain fixed  throughout the first crediting period, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  These data and parameters shall be available at the time of the validation of the project  for registration. 62. The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the proposed A6.4 project results  in conservative estimates. 63. The activity participants may use sampling for the determination of parameter values for  calculating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals if the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents allow this. In such cases, the activity participants shall develop and describe a  sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for Article 6.4  mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 6.5.8. Monitoring plan 64. The activity participants shall develop and describe a monitoring plan for the proposed  A6.4 project in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, as well as all other  applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and the provisions outlined in  paragraphs 66–69 below. 65. For projects involving removals, activity participants shall carry out the monitoring of  removals based on data derived from measurements, sampling, remote-sensing, third-  16 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  party sources and published literature that are robust and statistically representative,  conservative and take appropriate account of the associated uncertainties. 66. In developing a monitoring plan for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants shall  apply the following requirements, unless specified otherwise in the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or other applied methodological regulatory documents:  (a) Data variables that continuously impact the GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals (e.g. quantity of fuel inputs, amount of heat or electricity produced, gas  captured) shall be measured continuously and recorded at appropriate intervals;  (b) Measuring equipment shall be certified to national or IEC standards;  (c) The calibration of measuring equipment shall be carried out by an accredited  person or institution;  (d) Measured data with high levels of uncertainty shall be compared with data from  other sources to ensure consistency. 67.

The monitoring plan shall include all data, parameters and related information required by  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents, including:  (a) Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures;  (b) Uncertainty levels, methods and the associated accuracy level of measuring  instruments to be used for various parameters and variables;  (c) Specifications of the calibration frequency for the measuring equipment. If no  requirements for calibration frequency for measuring equipment is specified in the  applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied  methodological regulatory documents, or the Supervisory Body’s guidance, the  activity participants shall ensure that the equipment is calibrated in accordance  with the local/national standards or the manufacturer’s specifications. If  local/national standards or the manufacturer’s specifications are not available,  international standards may be used. 69. The monitoring plan shall also include a description of the monitoring management  system, including the following elements:  (a) The operational and management structure to be put in place to implement the  monitoring plan;  17 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) Provisions to ensure that data monitored and required for verification of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals and issuance of A6.4ERs is kept and  archived for at least two years after the end of the final crediting period or the last  issuance of A6.4ERs, whichever occurs later;  (c) Definitions of responsibilities and institutional arrangements for data collection and  archiving. 70. Unless the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents state otherwise, the activity participants may opt for  a delayed submission of the monitoring plan, which can occur after the registration of the  proposed A6.4 project and:  (a) At any time prior to the submission of the request for issuance of A6.4ERs for the  first monitoring period; or  (b) Together with the request for issuance of A6.4ERs for the first monitoring period. 71. If the activity participants choose to delay the submission of the monitoring plan in  accordance with paragraph 70 above, they shall clearly state in the PDD that the  submission of the monitoring plan is delayed and therefore the PDD submitted for  registration of the proposed A6.4 project does not contain information related to the  monitoring plan. 72. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment shall be reviewed and updated during the  crediting period and verified by a DOE if:  (a) The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan  based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan and the risk assessment  plan;  (b) Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are  not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;  (c) The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk  factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring  plan and the risk assessment plan. 6.6. Start date, crediting period type and duration 73. The activity participants shall determine the start date of the proposed A6.4 project as the  date on which they commit to making expenditures for constructing or modifying the main  equipment or facility (e.g., a wind turbine), or for providing or modifying a service (e.g.,  distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, change of transport management system) under  the proposed A6.4 project. If a contract for such expenditures (e.g. for procurement of a  wind turbine) is signed, the start date is the date on which the contract is signed. In other  cases, it is the date on which such expenditures are incurred. If the proposed A6.4 project  involves more than one of such contracts or incurred expenditures, the start date is the  earliest of the respective dates. Activities incurring minor pre-project expenses (e.g.,  feasibility studies, preliminary surveys) are not considered in the determination of the start  date. 74. The start date of the proposed A6.4 project shall be on or after 01 January 2021.  18 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 75.

The activity participants shall indicate in the PDD the same crediting period type  (renewable or fixed), start date and duration of the crediting period for the proposed A6.4  project as approved by the host Party in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,  which is:  (a) For GHG emission reduction projects:  (i) Each renewable crediting period shall be maximum five years and may be  renewed maximum twice, for a maximum total length of 15 years, or any  shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph  27(b) of the RMPs or by the applied methodologies; or  (ii) A fixed crediting period shall be maximum 10 years, or any shorter crediting  period specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs  or by the applied methodologies;  (b) For GHG removal projects, each renewable crediting period shall be maximum 15  years and may be renewed maximum twice, for a maximum total length of 45  years, or any shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to  paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs or by the applied methodologies. 77. The start date of the crediting period may be as early as 1 January 2021, but no later than  two years from the date of the submission of the PDD for global stakeholder consultation  in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 78. A project that has been registered as an A6.4 project may not be re-registered after the  expiration of its final crediting period. 6.7. Environmental, social and sustainable development impacts 79. The activity participants shall carry out an analysis of the environmental, social and the  sustainable development impacts of the proposed A6.4 project, and provide, in the PDD,  a summary of the analysis and a monitoring plan of such impacts and planned remedial  measures of negative impacts, if any, during the implementation and operation of the  project in accordance with the A6.4 SD Tool, and the filled in forms required by the A6.4  SD Tool as follows:  (a) Provide the identification, evaluation and avoidance of environmental and/or social  risks that may be caused by a proposed A6.4 activity in the A6.4 Environmental  and social safeguards risk assessment form;  (b) Provide the relevant mitigation and minimization measures and monitoring to be  implemented in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form in cases  where risks are identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form;  (c) Provide the evaluation of sustainable development impacts and the measuring,  monitoring and reporting methodology in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form.  19 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 80. In addition, if an environmental impact assessment and/or social impact assessment were  carried out for the proposed A6.4 project as required by and in accordance with relevant  procedures of the host Party, the activity participants shall provide all conclusions of such  assessments and references to all related documentation. 81. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by activity participants or by the DOE  during the validation, that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and  criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants may  request a deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4 SD Tool forms  accordingly. 6.8. Integrity safeguards 82. The development, implementation and operation of a proposed A6.4 project shall not  involve any illegal activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery and  criminal activities. For this purpose, the activity participants shall prepare a declaration  and submit it to the DOE as part of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project  in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 6.9. Local stakeholder consultation 83. The activity participants shall conduct a local, and where appropriate, subnational  stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively referred to as local stakeholder  consultation) on the proposed A6.4 project. The local stakeholder consultation shall be  conducted in accordance with applicable host Party rules and align with the modalities  contained in Appendix 2 and any additional elements for consultation required by the A6.4  SD Tool, at minimum. In this context:  (a) If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional  elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool, require more than those  required by the host Party rules, the activity participants shall follow the former,  covering any gaps between the two;  (b) If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional  elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool, and those required by the  host Party rules are not compatible where it is not possible to follow the  requirement in subparagraph (a), the activity participants shall describe the  modalities chosen and justify the choice. 6.10.

Post-registration activities 7.1. Continuous engagement of stakeholders 87. After the registration of the project under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the activity  participants shall create and maintain a window for local stakeholders to comment on the  implementation or the operation of the project until the end of the valid crediting period of  the project, taking into account any additional elements for consultation required by the  A6.4 SD Tool. 88. The activity participants shall also review any comments on the registered A6.4 project  submitted by Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations and  published on the UNFCCC website in accordance with the activity cycle procedure, if any. 89. The activity participants shall address the issues raised in the comments referred to in  paragraphs 87 and 88 above as appropriate and provide a summary of how they have  addressed the comments in the next monitoring report. 7.2. Integrity safeguards 90. The activity participants shall continue to ensure that the development, implementation  and operation of the registered A6.4 project do not involve any illegal activities, including  money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery and criminal activities. 7.3. Post-registration changes 7.3.1. General requirements 91. If there are any changes to the modalities or information in the MoC statement referred to  in paragraph 86 above after the request for registration has been submitted, the activity  participants shall revise the MoC statement and obtain approval of the changes from the  secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 92. The activity participants shall identify any proposed or actual changes to the  implementation, operation or monitoring of the registered A6.4 project. 93. The activity participants shall determine whether the proposed or actual changes referred  to in paragraph 92 above are temporary deviations, as referred to in section 7.3.2 below,  or permanent changes, as referred to in section 7.3.3 below. 94. For temporary deviations, the activity participants are not required to prepare a revised  PDD but shall describe the actual changes in the monitoring report. For permanent  changes, the activity participants shall prepare a revised PDD, the revised A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the revised A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and the revised A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form (both in track-change and clean versions) reflecting the  proposed or actual changes, using the valid version of the applicable PDD form. The  activity participants shall also provide a summary of the changes, including the reasons  for the changes and any additional information relating to the changes to the PDD.  21 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 7.3.2. Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms  (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form, and the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 95. If the activity participants are temporarily unable to monitor the registered A6.4 project in  accordance with the monitoring plan outlined in the registered PDD (hereinafter referred  to as the registered monitoring plan), the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants shall describe the nature, extent and  duration of the non-conforming monitoring period in the monitoring report, and:  (a) Propose alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-conforming monitoring  period. In this case, the activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions  or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of  the deviation; or  (b) Apply the following most conservative values approach when alternative  monitoring arrangements are not proposed:  (i) If the A6.4 project is to achieve GHG emission reductions, apply zero for  baseline GHG emissions for the entire non-conforming monitoring period; or  (ii) Apply the values assuming that the source of GHG emissions is operated at  the maximum capacity for the entire non-conforming monitoring period. In  the case of project GHG emissions related to the consumption of electricity,  add 10 per cent to account for transmission and distribution losses. 96. If the monitoring of environmental, social and sustainable development parameters results  in negative impacts that exceed the risks identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form and the indicators defined in both the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and in the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form and cannot be remediated by conducting additional consultation  with stakeholders or by employing mitigation measures, the activity participants shall  describe the reasons for the negative impact and the measures that will be employed to  prevent the negative impact in the future. 7.3.3. Permanent changes 7.3.3.1. Corrections 97. If the activity participants make any corrections to the project information or parameters  fixed at the registration of the A6.4 project, as described in the registered PDD, the activity  participants shall document these corrections in a revised PDD.16 16 This provision does not allow the parameter values fixed ex ante at the time of the registration of the  A6.4 project to be updated, as it is not regarded as a correction.  22 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 7.3.3.2. Changes to the start date of the crediting period 98. The activity participants of a registered A6.4 project may request a change to the start  date of the crediting period of the project if no request for issuance for the project has been  submitted yet and if the host Party approves the change in accordance with the activity  cycle procedure. In this context:  (a) The new start date shall not be later than two years from the date of submission of  the PDD for global stakeholder consultation conducted prior to registration in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure;  (b) Delaying the start date by up to one year or bringing forward the start date shall  not require any review and change to the application of methodologies and  standardized baselines;  (c) Delaying the start date by more than one year shall require full review and possible  changes to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized  baselines. 7.3.3.3. Inclusion of monitoring plan 99. The activity participants may submit the monitoring plan of an A6.4 project after its  registration in accordance with paragraph 70 above. In this case, if, at the time of  submission of the monitoring plan, there is a newer version of any of the methodologies  applied at the registration of the project, the activity participants shall prepare the  monitoring plan and revise other sections of the PDD by applying the latest valid version  of the methodology(ies). 7.3.3.4. Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool  forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the  A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4  Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of  monitoring from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 100. If the activity participants are unable to implement the registered monitoring plan, or if the  monitoring would permanently deviate from the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants shall describe the nature and extent  of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed alternative monitoring for the project  in a revised PDD. 101. If the monitoring would permanently deviate from the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the activity participants shall  describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed  alternative monitoring for the project in the revised A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 102. If the monitoring plan and risk assessment plan need to be reviewed and updated as per  paragraph 72 above, the activity participants shall describe the changes to the monitoring  plan and risk assessment plan in a revised PDD.  23 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 103.

Changes to project design 104. Where there are changes to the project design of a registered A6.4 project, the activity  participants shall prepare a revised PDD describing the nature and extent of the proposed  or actual changes. 105. Changes to a registered A6.4 project may include:  (a) Increasing the capacity17 specified in the registered PDD, subject to the following  conditions:  (i) An increase of the capacity that would result in additional GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals up to the same level as the materiality  thresholds for verification defined in the “Article 6.4 validation and verification  standard for projects”, which are:  a. 0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of 500,000 tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent or more per year;  b. 1 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of between 300,000  and 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year;  c. 2 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of 300,000 tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent or less per year;  (ii) An increase of the capacity that would result in additional GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals exceeding the respective thresholds  referred to in subparagraph (i), subject to the approval of such increase by  the host Party;  (b) Decreasing the capacity specified in the registered PDD;  (c) Updating the inputs to the investment analysis if the PDD was submitted for  validation prior to the start date of the project based on information and data that  was available at the start date of the project. This is only applicable for projects  that have demonstrated additionality through an investment analysis;  (d) Adding new components or extending/adding technologies/measures, subject to  the approval of the host Party, that introduces: 17 Installed/rated capacity that directly impacts GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.  24 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (i) Complementary technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy  transfer to/from the technologies/measures specified in the originally  registered PDD;18 or  (ii) More advanced version of the same technologies, as per the definition of “the  same technologies” in paragraph 24(b) above (e.g. improved performance in  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, efficiency, health, safety  and durability evidenced according to a relevant national or international  standard);19  (e) Removing a component or technology/measure specified in the registered PDD;  (f) Changing the technologies/measures to those that result in the same  technologies/measures as the ones in the originally registered PDD as per the  definition of “the same technologies” in paragraph 24(b) above;20  (g) Removing from or adding one or more site to the project registered with multiple  sites;  (h) Changing the actual operational parameters that are within the control of the  activity participants, that differ from the expected parameters;  (i) Any consequential changes to the application of methodologies, standardized  baselines and/or other methodological regulatory documents resulting from the  changes referred to in subparagraphs (a)–(f) above, including change to or addition  of other methodologies, other standardized baselines and/or other methodological  regulatory documents, or application of a baseline scenario that is more  appropriate as a result of the proposed or actual modifications to the project;  (j) Voluntarily updating the applied methodologies or the other applied methodological  regulatory documents to a later valid version, or voluntarily changing to other  methodologies, provided all requirements in the updated/changed methodologies  and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are met. 106. The activity participants shall report the impacts of the proposed or actual changes to the  registered A6.4 project on the following in the revised PDD:  (a) The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents with which the project has been registered; 18 Examples include:  (a) A landfill gas capture and electricity generation activity using three electricity generating units adds  an additional electricity generating unit without altering the quantity of landfill gas extracted (i.e. the  capacity of the landfill gas extraction system remained the same);  (b) Addition of a back-up electricity generating source to supply electricity during exigencies when the  project fails to meet the demand or is not available due to operational reasons. 19 Examples include a project disseminating lamps with useful life of two years changing to distribute lamps  with useful life of seven years. 20 Examples include changing the mode of utilization of recovered methane from a landfill, such as shifting  from flaring to heat generation or from heat generation to electricity generation.  25 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) The project boundary and any implications on the inclusion or exclusion of  emissions sources and leakage emissions;  (c) Compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (d) The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring of the project compared  with the requirements contained in the registered monitoring plan;  (e) The additionality of the project;  (f) The compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool. 107. The following applies if the proposed or actual changes affect the additionality of the  registered A6.4 project, as referred to in paragraph 106(e) above:  (a) For changes referred to in paragraph 105(c) above, additionality shall be  reassessed based on data and information that were available at the start date of  the A6.4 project, and subject to validation by a DOE through a post-registration  change process either prior to or as part of the first verification of emission  reductions or net removals;  (b) For all other changes, the demonstration of the impacts of the changes on the  additionality shall be based on the original input data for all other elements other  than the changes.21 108. If the proposed or actual changes referred to in paragraph 105(a)–(j) above affect the  identification, assessment or monitoring of environmental, social or sustainable  development impacts, the activity participants shall reassess, based on paragraph 106(f)  above, the impact caused by the changes by providing a revised version of the A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form (if applicable) and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form. These revised forms shall be subject to validation by a DOE prior to or as part of the  first verification of emission reductions or net removals. 109. Where the activity participants cannot demonstrate compliance with the requirements of  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents with which the A6.4 project has been registered, the  activity participants shall:  (a) Revise the PDD, applying:  (i) A later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents; or  (ii) Other methodologies, other standardized baselines or other methodological  regulatory documents that are applicable to the project; and  (b) Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the newly applied  methodologies, the newly applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents in the revised PDD. 21 Ifa proposed or actual modification adversely impacts the additionality of the project, subsequent  requests for issuance of A6.4ERs based on such modifications will be rejected.  26 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 7.3.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme 110. If an A6.4 project, after its registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism, is also registered  under, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional, national,  subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the activity participants shall  obtain a confirmation of such registration or coverage from the other scheme. 7.4. Reversals related actions for projects involving removals and emission  reductions projects with reversal risks 111. In case of occurrence of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that  could potentially lead to a reversal, activity participants shall prepare a preliminary  assessment report in order to determine whether the observed event has resulted in an  actual reversal. The report shall contain the following information:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the  monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed; 112. If the observed event is an ongoing event, the preliminary assessment report shall be  prepared after the event has ended or has been fully contained. 113. The preliminary assessment report shall conclude, on the basis of transparent and  verifiable evidence, whether the observed event did or did not result in actual reversals. 114. If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report or if the  preliminary assessment concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual  reversal, the activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report based on the monitoring  plan contained in the PDD and submit it to a DOE for verification. The monitoring report  shall include:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the  monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;  (d) Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could  have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions, along with a  summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period  covered by the monitoring report;  (e) Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent  with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered PDD;  (f) Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been  assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the  registered PDD.  27 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 115. Following the submission of the monitoring report referred in paragraph 114 above, activity  participants shall:  (a) Review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk rating of  the activity as necessary, which shall include the development of plans to prevent  further releases of GHGs through a post-registration change;  (b) Review the compliance with the requirements and safeguards contained in the  A6.4 SD Tool, taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts  caused by the reversal and develop plans to prevent the recurrence of such  negative environmental and social impacts;  (c) Review and update the monitoring plan in case additional risk factors are identified  following a reversal that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan. 8. Implementation and monitoring 8.1. General requirements 116. The activity participants shall implement and operate the registered A6.4 project in  accordance with the description provided in the registered PDD, including all physical  features. 117. The activity participants shall continuously monitor the registered A6.4 project and its GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals in accordance with the registered monitoring  plan. 118. The activity participants shall describe the implementation of the registered A6.4 project  and the monitored GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals in monitoring reports  to provide an understanding of how the implementation and monitoring were conducted. 119. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  monitoring reports shall be based on the monitoring plan contained in the latest version of  the PDD and shall include the elements specified in paragraph 114 above. 120. The activity participants shall report monitoring results in monitoring reports, including the  relevant forms of the A6.4 SD Tool, in the following manner:  (a) Each monitoring report shall cover the entire duration of a monitoring period without  any gaps. If monitoring did not occur during any part of the monitoring period due  to force majeure circumstances or for other reasons the issuance of A6.4 ERs is  not sought, the monitoring report shall clearly indicate such period and explain the  circumstances;  (b) The first monitoring period shall start from the start of the crediting period as  specified in the registered PDD. If actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals have not occurred by the start of the crediting period, the monitoring  report for the first monitoring period shall report zero GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals for the period until they occur;  (c) If negative GHG emission reductions (i.e., net GHG emissions) have occured  during a monitoring period, such negative values shall be clearly indicated and  28 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  deducted from the total amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  for that monitoring period;  (d) The monitored amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals shall be  presented by year of occurrence in monitoring reports;  (e) The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level environmental and social indicators  shall be presented using the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form of the A6.4 SD Tool, if applicable;  (f) The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level sustainable development indicators  shall be presented using the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form of the  A6.4 SD Tool;  (g) Monitoring reports shall be prepared chronologically and with no gaps between two  successive monitoring periods;  (h) Monitoring results for different crediting periods shall be documented in separate  monitoring reports. 121. Notwithstanding paragraphs 120(e) and 120(f) above, for projects that have successfully  transitioned from the CDM and prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits  description report” in accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool”  developed under the CDM at the time of transition, the monitoring report shall include the  outcome of monitoring of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on  the document describing how the activity participant intends to monitor sustainable  development co-benefits of the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring  results in accordance with the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4  mechanism”. 122. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  monitoring reports shall be submitted within the frequency specified by the applied  methodologies or in shorter intervals, or following the observation of an event of GHG  release that could potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in section 7.4 above. 123. All monitoring, verifications and requests for issuance of A6.4ERs in respect of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by A6.4 projects shall be calculated  using the GWPs contained in Appendix 1 in accordance with section 5.2 above. 124. The activity participants shall maintain all monitoring results for the registered A6.4 project  in accordance with the monitoring management system described in the registered  monitoring plan as per paragraph 69 above. 8.2.

When describing the implementation and monitoring of the registered A6.4 project, activity  participants shall provide, inter alia, the following information:  (a) The title and UNFCCC reference number of the project;  (b) Names of the activity participants involved;  (c) Location of the project;  29 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (d) Titles, versions and UNFCCC reference numbers of the applied methodologies  and, where applicable, the applied standardized baselines, including any other  methodologies or methodological tools to which the applied methodologies refer;  (e) The type, start date and duration of the crediting period;  (f) The monitoring period sequence number and dates of coverage;  (g) The version number of the PDD applicable to the monitoring period. 8.3. Avoidance of double issuance 126. The activity participants shall confirm that the reported GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals for which they intend to request issuance of A6.4ERs do not overlap with  any of the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for which they have already  requested or intend to request credits under any other international, regional, national,  subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme. The activity participants shall  further acknowledge that if such double issuance is detected, the DOE will issue a  negative verification opinion, the request for issuance will be rejected by the Supervisory  Body, or the double issuance amounts will be deducted from future issuance of A6.4ERs  for the same A6.4 project if the requested A6.4ERs have already been issued. 127. If the A6.4 project is also registered under, or covered by a programme, under any other  international, regional, national subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting  scheme prior to the request for issuance, the activity participants shall also obtain a  confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have not been or will not be  credited under such other crediting scheme. 8.4. Description of implemented registered project 128. The activity participants shall provide a description of the implemented registered A6.4  project including:  (a) A description of the installed technologies, technical processes and equipment;  (b) Information on the implementation and actual operation of the project, including  relevant dates (e.g., construction, commissioning, start of operation). For a project  that consists of more than one site, the activity participants shall describe the status  of implementation and start date of operation for each site. For a project with  phased implementation, the activity participants shall indicate the progress of the  project achieved in each phase. 129. The activity participants shall indicate whether there are any temporary deviations from  the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents, in accordance with  section 7.3.2 above, or if there are any permanent changes to the registered A6.4 project  or the registered monitoring plan, in accordance with section 7.3.3 above (hereinafter  referred to as post-registration changes). For post-registration changes that have been  approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall indicate the dates of  approval.  30 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 8.5. Description of monitoring system 130. The activity participants shall describe the monitoring system, and provide diagrams  (graphical schemes) showing all relevant monitoring points. This description may include  data collection procedures (information flow including data generation, aggregation,  recording, calculations and reporting), organizational structure, roles and responsibilities  of personnel, and emergency procedures for the monitoring system. 8.6. Data and parameters 131. The activity participants shall provide all parameters used to calculate the baseline, BAU,  project and leakage GHG emissions, or the baseline and actual net GHG removals, as  well as other relevant parameters for the monitoring period as required by the registered  monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. The activity participants shall provide  information on how these data and parameters were monitored. 132. For each parameter, the activity participants shall:  (a) Provide the values of the monitored parameter necessary for calculating GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals. Where data are continuously  measured, they shall be presented using an appropriate time interval. For any  default value that is not fixed at the time of registration of the A6.4 project, the most  recent value shall be applied;  (b) Describe the equipment used to monitor each parameter, including details on  accuracy class and calibration information (frequency, date of calibration and  validity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan;  (c) Describe how the parameter is measured/calculated including the measurement  and recording frequency;  (d) Provide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g., logbooks, daily records, surveys);  (e) Provide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant;  (f) Describe the QA/QC procedures applied, if applicable, as per the registered  monitoring plan;  (g) Provide information on appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values and any  other relevant reference values. 133. If monitored data and parameters are determined through a sampling approach, the  activity participants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance  with the sampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan. 134. For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing  a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-ante determination,  or that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring a determination of these  values ex-ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of the  submission of the request for registration for this purpose, the activity participants shall  apply the same version of the standardized baseline monitoring until the end of the first  crediting period.  31 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 135. For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing  a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-post determination  where there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of registration, the  activity participants may switch to the ex-ante determination, at any time during the first  crediting period, by applying an applicable standardized baseline that becomes available  after the registration and is valid at the time of the switch, and apply the same version of  the standardized baseline for the purpose of monitoring for the remainder of the same  crediting period. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline shall undergo the  post-registration change approval process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,  and the standardized baseline shall be valid at the time of the submission of the post-  registration change approval request. 136. For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing  a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals, if the selected crediting period type is  renewable, the activity participants shall, at each renewal of the crediting period, choose  the ex-ante or ex-post determination of parameter values, unless otherwise required by  the applied methodology or methodological tool, and shall follow the same rules in terms  of the use and validity of standardized baselines as in paragraphs 134 and 135 above. 137. Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form, if applicable, and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form containing all  parameters used to monitor the environmental and social impacts and the sustainable  development impacts and explaining how any negative environmental and social impacts  have been assessed, mitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in  the registered PDD. 138. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the  DOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements  and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants  may request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4  SD Tool forms accordingly. 139. For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the  monitoring report as part of the investment analysis. 8.7. Calculation of emission reductions or net removals 140. The activity participants shall identify the formulae used by the registered A6.4 project for  the monitoring period and provide the calculations of the following:  (a) Baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals;  (b) Project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals;  (c) Leakage GHG emissions;  (d) GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals. 141. Where projects involving removals also result in emission reductions, the accounting of  removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the monitoring report in  accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity.  32 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 142. The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project with their estimates provided  in the registered PDD. 143. For any registered A6.4 project, the activity participants shall explain the cause of any  increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the  monitoring period (e.g., higher water availability, higher plant load factor), including all  information (i.e., data and/or parameters) that is different from what is stated in the  registered PDD. 9. Renewal of crediting period 144. The crediting period of a registered A6.4 project may be renewed if the host Party has  approved the renewal when approving the project prior to its registration in accordance  with the activity cycle procedure. 145. To support a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project, the  activity participants shall, using the valid version of the applicable PDD form, update the  sections of the PDD of the project relating to:  (a) The baseline emissions, including updating the downward adjustment as per  paragraphs 55 and 56 above;  (b) The BAU scenario and emissions, and the difference between the baseline  emissions and BAU emissions as annual and total amounts with respect to the  crediting period to be renewed;  (c) The additionality by updating the regulatory analysis;  (d) The estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable);  (e) The monitoring plan (if applicable);  (f) The A6.4 SD Tool forms;  (g) The risk assessment and monitoring plan for projects involving removals and for  emission reduction projects with reversal risks;  (h) The crediting period. 146. When updating the PDD, activity participants shall apply methodologies in one of the  following manners:  (a) The activity participants shall use the valid version of the methodologies and  methodological tools applied in the registered PDD; that is, either the latest version  at the time of the submission of the request for renewal or the previous version if  the submission of the request for renewal is still within the grace period of the  previous version for use;22  (b) If any of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD was withdrawn after the  registration of the project and was replaced by consolidated methodologies, the  activity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies; 22 Referredto in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools”.  33 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) If the project no longer meets the applicability conditions of the methodologies or  methodological tools mentioned in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above due to the  methodologies or methodological tools revisions or due to an update of the project  baseline, the activity participants shall either:  (i) Select other applicable approved methodologies; or  (ii) Request, either through the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the  crediting period or by the activity participants, a clarification as to whether a  deviation from the valid version of the methodologies (including consolidated  methodologies thereof) or the methodological tools applied in the registered  PDD, or from any other selected methodologies, or any other methodological  tools applied in accordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable.  This clarification shall be made under the clarification process outlined in the  “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of baseline and  monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. 147. In updating the PDD of the registered A6.4 project in accordance with paragraphs 145 and  146 above, the activity participants shall consider the application of an approved  standardized baseline to the project as follows:  (a) The activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved standardized  baseline if:  (i) The standardized baseline is applied in the registered PDD and the valid  version of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the project and to  the methodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 146 above; or  (ii) The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD but the valid  version of the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory23 is  applicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with  paragraph 146 above. However, if the submission of the request for renewal  of the crediting period is made within 240 days after the standardized  baseline became valid, the activity participants may update the PDD without  selecting the standardized baseline.  (b) If the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD is  no longer applicable to the project and/or to the valid version of the methodologies  applied in the registered PDD due to a revision of the standardized baseline after  the registration of the project, the activity participants shall:  (i) Select another applicable approved standardized baseline; or  (ii) Use only the valid version of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD  that are still applicable to the project and that can be used independently for  estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals without using the  standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD;  (c) The activity participants may use the valid version of an applicable approved  standardized baseline if:  (i) The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD; and 23 For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 11.  34 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (ii) The standardized baseline does not require its mandatory selection but is  applicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with  paragraph 146 above. 148. The activity participants shall demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update  in accordance with paragraphs 149−150 below. 149. To demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update, the activity participants  shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies, standardized  baselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 150. If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline were determined ex-  ante and were not monitored during the crediting period and are no longer valid, the activity  participants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be  provided by the Supervisory Body. 151. The results of the process described in paragraphs 145–150 above shall be used to define  a new version of the PDD. 152. The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up to date. 153. If the activity participants plan to make, or have already made, a post-registration change  to the project design effective from the start date of the new crediting period, they shall  clearly indicate this change in the new version of the PDD, distinguishing it from other  updates of information due to renewal of the crediting period. 10. Post-crediting monitoring and reporting 154. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks,  activity participants shall continue monitoring the project after the end of the last active  crediting period to:  (a) Assess whether any reversals have occurred;  (b) Quantify the amount of reversals; and  (c) Confirm the continued storage of the GHGs. 155. Activity participants may terminate the post-crediting monitoring, subject to approval by  the Supervisory Body, if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable  information, that:  (a) The stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or  (b) The potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of  the relevant section of the removals standard (i.e., Remediation of reversals). 11. Voluntary deregistration of project 156. The activity participants may request the secretariat to deregister an A6.4 project in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure at any time after the registration of the project. 157. An A6.4 project that has been deregistered may not be reregistered as an A6.4 project or  included as a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA.  35 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 Appendix 1.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, to among others, develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated several elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The Supervisory Body, at its eighth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 validation and  verification standard for projects” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that sets out the  requirements relating to validation and verification for Article 6.4 projects (A6.4 projects). 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of  Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”4 (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies  standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article  6.4 mechanism”5 (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article  6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two  standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas  the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have  met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental  risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to  sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of  the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). 5. The Supervisory Body, at its fifteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Demonstration of  additionality for mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the additionality  standard) that sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to  demonstrating additionality. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex.

Fair presentation 13. Ensure that the validation or verification activity, findings, conclusions and reports are  truthfully and fairly presented. Report significant obstacles encountered during the  validation or verification, as well as unresolved, diverging opinions among validators or  verifiers, to the responsible party (e.g. the secretariat/the Supervisory Body) and the client  (e.g. the activity participants). 4.5. Documentation 14. Document the validation or verification and ensure it establishes the basis for the  conclusion and conformity with the criteria. 4.6. Conservativeness 15. When assessing comparable alternatives, use a selection that is cautiously moderate. 5. General validation and verification requirements 5.1. Validation and verification approach 16. The DOE shall select a competent team to perform the validation or verification for the  A6.4 project in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”. 17. In carrying out its validation or verification work, the DOE shall:  (a) Follow this standard and integrate its provisions into the DOE’s own quality  management systems;7  (b) Apply the most recent applicable decisions and guidance provided by the  Supervisory Body;  (c) Determine whether each proposed or registered A6.4 project complies with all  applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, including those specified  in the “Article 6.4 activity standard for projects” (hereinafter referred to as the  activity standard), the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and  guidelines applied in accordance with the selected methodologies (hereinafter “any  other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines (to be)  applied in accordance with the selected/applied methodologies” are collectively  referred to as “other applied methodological regulatory documents’’); 7 For more information on the quality management system, see “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation”, A6.4-  STAN-ACCR-001, Section 13.  7 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (d) Assess the accuracy, conservativeness, relevance, completeness, consistency  and transparency of the information provided by the activity participants;8  (e) Determine whether information provided by the activity participants is reliable and  credible;9  (f) Apply consistent validation or verification criteria to:  (i) The requirements of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents  throughout the crediting period(s);  (ii) A6.4 projects with similar characteristics such as a similar application of the  selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other  applied methodological regulatory documents, use of technology, time period  or region;  (iii) Expert judgements, both over time and among A6.4 projects;  (g) Base its findings and conclusions on objective evidence and conduct all validation  or verification activities in accordance with Article 6.4 mechanism rules and  procedures;  (h) Not omit evidence that is likely to alter the validation or verification opinion;  (i) Present information in the validation report or verification and certification report in  a factual, neutral and coherent manner and document all assumptions, provide  references to background material, and identify changes made to the  documentation;  (j) Safeguard the confidentiality of all information obtained or created during the  validation or verification;  (k) Conduct an independent and thorough assessment in accordance with the  applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements. 5.2. Use of and compliance with applicable standards 18. In carrying out its validation and verification work, the DOE shall use and determine the  compliance with the valid version of applicable standards, methodologies, standardized  baselines, methodological tools, A6.4 SD Tool, guidelines and other regulatory documents  adopted by the CMA or the Supervisory Body. 5.3. Use of applicable forms 19. The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants completed the valid version of  the relevant forms by following the instructions therein. 8 These principles can also be found in the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects”. 9 Information is credible if it is authentic and is able to inspire belief or trust, and the willingness of persons  to accept the quality of evidence. Information is reliable if the quality of evidence is accurate and credible  and able to yield the same results on a repeated basis.  8 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 20. The DOE contracted to conduct validation for registration of a proposed A6.4 project, post-  registration changes or renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project shall  prepare a validation report using the valid version of the relevant validation report form 10  and following the instructions therein. 21. The DOE contracted to conduct verification and certification of the implementation of the  registered A6.4 project and monitored GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  shall prepare a verification and certification report using the valid version of the relevant  verification and certification report form11 and following the instructions therein. 5.4. Use of applicable global warming potentials 22. The DOE shall determine whether the global warming potentials (GWPs) were correctly  applied in both the project design document (PDD) and the monitoring report, in  accordance with relevant requirements of the activity standard. 6. Validation for registration of projects 6.1. General requirements 6.1.1. Overarching requirement 23. The DOE shall determine whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with all relevant  requirements in the activity standard for registration of the project under the Article 6.4  mechanism. 6.1.2. Standard auditing techniques 24. The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. 25. When assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of validation specified  throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including,  but not limited to:  (a) Document review, involving:  (i) Reviewing of data and information;  (ii) Crosschecking the information provided in the PDD against independent  sources of information not used to determine the reliability of information in  the PDD. This may include where available, sectoral or local expertise of the  DOE; and, if necessary, conducting independent background investigations;  (b) Conducting follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection and telephone or e-mail  interviews), including:  (i) Interviews with relevant stakeholders in the host country, such as personnel  with knowledge of the project design and implementation; 10 All types of validation report forms are available on the UNFCCC website. 11 All types of verification and certification report forms are available on the UNFCCC website.  9 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (ii) Crosschecks between information provided by interviewed personnel (i.e. by  checking sources or other interviews) to ensure that no relevant information  has been omitted;  (c) Referencing to available information relating to projects or technologies similar to  the proposed A6.4 project under validation;  (d) Reviewing the appropriateness of formulae and accuracy of calculations, based on  the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other  applied methodological regulatory documents;  (e) Applying sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and  surveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory  Body. 26. It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at validation for the proposed  A6.4 project if:  (a) Its estimated annual average of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is  more than 100,000 t CO2 eq; or  (b) There is pre-project information that is relevant to the requirements for registration  of the project and may not be traceable after the implementation of the project;  (c) The project is deemed to have high risk of uncertainty in terms of the achievement  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals as estimated in the PDD, to be  determined in accordance with the relevant guidance to be provided by the  Supervisory Body. 27. For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 26 above, it is optional for the DOE to  conduct an on-site inspection at validation. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site  inspection as a means of validation, it shall describe the alternative means used and justify  that they are sufficient for the purpose of validation. If the DOE conducts a remote  inspection as an alternative means to an on-site inspection, the DOE should follow the  guidance contained in Appendix 1. 28. Where no specific means of validation is specified, the DOE shall apply the standard  auditing techniques described in paragraph 25 above. 6.1.3. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests 29. If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order  to determine whether the proposed A6.4 project meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism  rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues are accurately identified,  formulated, discussed and concluded in the validation report. 30. The DOE shall raise a corrective action request (CAR) if one of the following situations  occurs:  (a) Mistakes have been made by the activity participants that may influence the ability  of the proposed A6.4 project to achieve real, measurable, verifiable and additional  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (b) The applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have not been met;  10 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) There is a risk that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals cannot be  monitored or calculated. 31. The DOE shall raise a clarification request (CL) if the information provided by the activity  participants is insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article  6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have been met. 32. The DOE shall raise a forward action request (FAR) if issues related to project  implementation that require review during the first verification after the validation of the  proposed A6.4 project are identified. The DOE shall not raise a FAR that relates to the  Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements for registration of the project. 33. The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants take  appropriate actions, such as rectifying the project design and/or the PDD, or providing  additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s concerns. If this is not done,  the DOE shall not submit a request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project. 34. The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its validation report. This reporting  shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity participants, the  means of validation of such responses and references to any resulting changes in the  PDD or its supporting documents, in accordance with paragraph 33 above. 6.2. Validation of compliance with specific requirements for registration 6.2.1. General 35. The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in  sections 5 and 6.1 above, whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with all relevant  requirements for registration as contained in the activity standard, including the  requirements on:  (a) Notification of prior consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism;  (b) Compliance with the host Party’s indication of activity types that it would approve;  (c) Description of the project;  (d) Avoidance of double or revived registration;  (e) Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines and their applicability to  the project;  (f) Deviation from or revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool, if  applicable;  (g) Application of methodologies and standardized baselines, including in terms of:  (i) Defining of the project boundary and identifying of sources, sinks and GHGs  included in the project boundary, and identifying of leakage;  (ii) Identifying of baseline scenario;  (iii) Demonstrating of additionality;  (iv) Assessing the risk of non-permanence of GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals and measures to address reversals if they occur;  11 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (v) Estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (vi) Developing a monitoring plan;  (h) Specification of the project start date, crediting period type, and duration;  (i) Analysis of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development  impacts;  (j) Undergoing local or subnational stakeholder consultation;  (k) Undergoing global stakeholder consultation;  (l) Approval of the project by the host Party;  (m) Authorization of activity participants by the host Party and other participating  Parties;  (n) Preparation of the modalities of communication statement. 36. When validating the compliance of the proposed A6.4 project with the requirements for  registration referred to in paragraph 35 above, the DOE shall additionally follow the  specific guidance on validation regarding some of these requirements provided in sections  6.2.2−6.2.12 below. 6.2.2. Treatment of double or revived registration 37. The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to double or  revived registration contained in the activity standard, based on publicly available  information and/or information provided by the activity participants upon the DOE’s  request. 6.2.3. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 38. The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are compatible with  the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance  with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. 39. If, based on local and sectoral knowledge, the DOE is aware that comparable information  is available from credible sources other than that used in the PDD, it shall cross-check the  PDD against such other sources to confirm that the A6.4 project meets the applicability  conditions of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 40. The DOE shall determine whether the proposed A6.4 project has selected the  standardized baselines where their selection is mandatory. 41. If the DOE cannot determine the applicability of a selected methodology, methodological  tool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed A6.4 project, the DOE shall request a  clarification on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision  and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and/or the “Procedure:  Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.  12 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 6.2.4. Deviation from methodology or methodological tool 42. The DOE may seek a clarification from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a  deviation from the selected approved methodology or methodological tool in accordance  with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools” prior to the submission of a request for registration, if the DOE, when  performing validation of the proposed A6.4 project, or upon request from the activity  participants, finds that, due to a project-specific12 issue implying that a revision of the  methodology and/or methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the  project deviated from:  (a) The selected methodology or methodological tool; or  (b) Sections in the selected methodology or methodological tool that are not  standardized by the selected standardized baselines, in cases where the proposed  A6.4 project applies standardized baselines. 43. The DOE shall submit an assessment of the case including demonstration that the  deviation does not require revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool.  The DOE shall include a description of the impact of the deviation on GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals by the proposed A6.4 project. 44. Alternatively, if the DOE considers that a revision of the selected methodology or  methodological tool would be required to address the project situation, then the DOE shall  submit, or shall request the activity participants to submit, a request for revision of the  selected methodology or methodological tool in accordance with the “Procedure:  Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”. 12 Examples of project-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following:  (a) The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a  certain method. The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 project face a difficulty in acquiring  the specified instrumentation or a difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however,  they can achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative  instrumentation or measurement method;  (b) A proposed A6.4 project does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology  for a certain parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the project to estimate the  parameter with equal reliability and accuracy;  (c) A minor deviation is sought for a project-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative.  For example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5% of  rated capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the plant  has never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated  capacity (20% below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying conservative  approaches to calculate the emission reduction in such a project-specific case;  (d) A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to  project-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology. For example, a well-  justified conservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to  address uncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period.  13 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 6.2.5. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 6.2.5.1. Host Party methodological requirements 45. The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents are applied in a way to  comply with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in  accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. 6.2.5.2. Project boundary, sources, leakage and greenhouse gases 46. If the applied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines allow the activity  participants to choose whether a source or gas is to be included within the project  boundary, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have justified that  choice and whether the justification provided is reasonable. 47. If the DOE identifies emission sources that will be affected by the implementation of the  proposed A6.4 project and which are expected to contribute more than 1 per cent of the  overall expected average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, and  these sources are not addressed by the applied methodologies or the applied  standardized baselines, the DOE shall request a clarification of, revision to, or deviation  from, the methodologies or the standardized baselines, as appropriate, in accordance with  the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools” or the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update  of standardized baselines”. 6.2.5.3. Baseline scenario 48. If the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the  identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on its expertise  and local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are considered by  the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those required by the  methodologies are realistic and credible in the context of the proposed A6.4 project and  that no alternative scenario has been excluded. The DOE shall assess whether a more  ambitious baseline requirement, as determined by the host Party and approved by the  Supervisory Body, has been applied in the identification of the most plausible baseline  scenario, if applicable. 49. The DOE shall determine whether the most plausible baseline scenario identified is  reasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the PDD. 50. Notwithstanding of paragraphs 48 and 49 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an  approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the DOE shall  determine whether the baseline scenario for the project is the scenario specified by the  applied standardized baseline. 6.2.5.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 51. The DOE shall assess whether the identification and the description in the PDD of the  business-as-usual (hereinafter referred to as BAU) scenario or reference benchmark  emissions comply with the requirements of the activity standard, applied methodologies  and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  14 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 6.2.5.5. Demonstration of additionality 52. The DOE shall determine whether the additionality of the proposed A6.4 project is  demonstrated in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the applied methodological tools for demonstration of additionality, if any,  by verifying the reliability and credibility of all data used, and rationales, assumptions and  justifications provided by the activity participants, and critically assessing the evidence  presented, using local knowledge and sectoral and financial expertise. 53. The DOE shall determine whether the additionality is demonstrated for the A6.4 project in  its entirety and not separately demonstrated for different parts of the A6.4 project,13 unless  the different parts can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect each  other.14 54. Notwithstanding paragraph 52 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an approved  standardized baseline that standardizes additionality, the DOE shall determine whether  the project meets the additionality criteria (e.g. positive lists of technologies) in the applied  standardized baseline. 6.2.5.6. Addressing non-permanence for projects involving removals and emission  reduction projects with reversal risks 55. The DOE shall determine whether the risks of reversals were identified and assessed in  compliance with the requirements of the activity standard, provisions of the removals  standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 56. The DOE shall determine whether the risk assessment was conducted in accordance with  the applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 57. The DOE shall assess the revised risk assessment every five years from the start of the  first crediting period and in any of the following circumstances:  (a) The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan  based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan and the risk assessment  plan;  (b) Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are  not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;  (c) The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk  factors that are not included or are not adequately assessed in the monitoring plan  and the risk assessment plan. 6.2.5.7. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals 58. Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or  parameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided 13 For example, if a project involves the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the landfill gas for  energy generation, additionality should be demonstrated for both parts together, and not separately for  the landfill gas capture part and for the energy generation part. 14 For example, if a project involves the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the catalytic  abatement of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at a nitric acid production plant.  15 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (based on the choice of the baseline scenario, the context of the proposed A6.4 project  and other evidence provided), and that the correct equations and parameters have been  used, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines  and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. 59. The DOE shall verify the justification given in the PDD for the choice of data and  parameters used in the equations as follows:  (a) Data and parameters fixed ex ante: If data and parameters will not be monitored  throughout the crediting period of the proposed A6.4 project but have already been  determined and will remain fixed throughout the crediting period, the DOE shall  determine whether all data sources and assumptions are appropriate and  calculations are correct as applicable to the proposed A6.4 project, and will result  in an accurate or otherwise conservative estimate of GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals;  (b) Data and parameters to be monitored: For data and parameters that will be  monitored or estimated on implementation and hence become available only after  validation of the proposed A6.4 project, the DOE shall determine whether the  estimates provided in the PDD for these data and parameters are reasonable;  (c) If the applied methodologies require that any of the data, parameters or estimates  be determined based on sampling in accordance with the standard for sampling  and surveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the  Supervisory Body, the DOE shall determine whether the sampling efforts were  undertaken in accordance with such standard. 60. For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the DOE shall  assess whether the estimation of removals and emission reductions is separated and was  undertaken in accordance with the applied methodology(ies). 61. The DOE shall determine whether the correct approach was applied for the estimation of  BAU emissions, baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage emissions in  accordance with the relevant provisions of the activity standard and applied  methodology(ies). 62. The DOE shall assess whether the difference between the baseline emissions and BAU  emissions as an annual and total amount with respect to the crediting period was  estimated correctly. 63. The DOE shall assess whether the downwards adjustment of the baseline, if applicable,  was applied in compliance with the requirements of the activity standard and the  respective provisions of the methodologies standard, applied methodologies and other  applied methodological regulatory documents. 64. The DOE shall determine whether the leakage emissions were identified, described and  calculated in accordance with the activity standard and relevant applied methodologies  and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 65. The DOE shall also assess whether the leakage emissions are avoided or minimized and  accounted for in line with the respective requirements of the activity standard, applied  methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  16 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 6.2.5.8.

The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in  sections 5 and 6.1 above mutatis mutandis and section 7.1 above, whether the proposed  or actual post-registration change to a registered A6.4 project falls within one of the  following types of changes that may be allowed and complies with all relevant  requirements for post-registration changes as contained in the activity standard:  (a) Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan in the registered PDD  (thereinafter referred to as the registered monitoring plan), the A6.4 SD Tool forms  (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;  (b) Permanent changes, including:  21 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (i) Corrections;  (ii) Changes to the start date of the crediting period;  (iii) Inclusion of a monitoring plan;  (iv) Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or the A6.4 SD  Tool forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment  form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4  Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring  from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;  (v) Changes to the project design;  (c) Registration under, or overlap with, other crediting scheme. 88. When validating the compliance of the proposed or actual post-registration change with  the relevant requirements for post-registration change, the DOE shall additionally follow  the specific guidance on validation for some types of post-registration changes provided  in sections 7.2.2−7.2.3 below. 7.2.2. Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan and/or the A6.4 SD Tool  forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 89. The DOE shall determine whether there is a temporary deviation from the monitoring plan  in the registered PDD, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social  management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), the applied  methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological  regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool and, if there is, the DOE shall determine  whether the temporary deviation complies with the relevant requirements in the activity  standard. 90. If the deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), the  applied methodologies, the A6.4 SD Tool or the applied standardized baselines is  applicable to the monitoring period under verification and part of the previous or  subsequent monitoring period, the DOE shall determine the exact period to which the  deviation applies. 7.2.3. Permanent changes 7.2.3.1. Corrections 91. If the activity participants have made corrections to project information or parameters fixed  at registration of the A6.4 project as described in the registered PDD, the DOE shall  determine whether:  (a) The corrected information is an accurate reflection of actual project information;  and/or  22 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) The corrected parameters are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the  registered monitoring plan, the applied standardized baselines and the other  applied methodological regulatory documents. 7.2.3.2. Inclusion of monitoring plan 92. If the activity participants chose to omit a monitoring plan at registration of the A6.4 project  and wish to include it thereafter, the DOE shall determine whether the design of the  monitoring plan and other sections of the PDD comply with the relevant requirements in  the activity standard in accordance with section 6.2.5 above. 7.2.3.3. Changes to the start date of the crediting period 93. The DOE shall determine whether there has been no request for issuance having been  submitted for the A6.4 project based on the information on the UNFCCC website and  whether the change is within the allowable limit specified in the activity standard. 94. If the DOE determines that both conditions referred to in paragraph 93 above are met, the  DOE shall further determine whether the change would require full review and possible  change to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized baselines  in accordance with the activity standard, and conduct validation accordingly. 7.2.3.4. Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or A6.4 SD Tool  forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form,  A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring from the  applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other methodological  regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 95. The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring  plan described in the revised PDD are in compliance with the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 96. The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring  plan or the permanent deviation of the monitoring from the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological regulatory documents  is likely to lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation of GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals, and if so, the DOE shall request the activity participants to apply  conservative assumptions or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to  ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as  a result of the permanent change or the permanent deviation. 97. The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the  A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), provided  as part of the revised PDD, are in compliance with the A6.4SD Tool and relevant  provisions of the activity standard. 98. For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  DOE shall determine whether the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan were  reviewed and updated in accordance with relevant provisions of the activity standard,  23 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  removals standard and other applied methodology regulatory documents every five years  and in the circumstances specified in paragraph 57 above. 7.2.3.5. Changes to the project design 99. In case of an actual change, the DOE shall, in its judgement, by means of an on-site  inspection or remote inspection and review of the description in the revised PDD submitted  by the activity participants of the nature and extent of the actual change, determine  whether this description accurately reflects the implementation, operation and monitoring  of the modified A6.4 project. 100. The DOE shall, by means of an on-site inspection or remote inspection, assess the  impacts of the actual change on the monitoring plan, the level of accuracy of the monitoring  activity, and compliance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 101. The DOE shall, by means of reviewing the revised PDD against applicable methodological  requirements, determine whether the proposed or actual change would adversely affect  the conclusions of the validation report of the registered PDD with regard to:  (a) The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents with which the A6.4 project has been registered;  (b) The project boundary and any implications on the inclusion or exclusion of  emission sources or removal sinks and leakage emissions;  (c) The compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (d) The level of accuracy and completeness of the monitoring compared with the  requirements contained in the registered monitoring plan, including the frequency  of measurements, the quality of monitoring equipment (e.g. calibration  requirements, the quality assurance and quality control procedures);  (e) The additionality of the project;  (f) Compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool. 102. For projects that demonstrate additionality through investment analysis for which the PDD  was submitted for validation prior to the start date of the project, and for which the updated  investment analysis is submitted as a post-registration change, the DOE shall determine  whether the investment analysis has been updated based on the data and information for  the investment analysis available at the start date of the project in accordance with the  relevant provisions of the activity standard and other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 103. If the proposed or actual change affects the additionality of the registered A6.4 project, the  DOE shall confirm that the project is still additional after the change. 104. Notwithstanding paragraph 103 above, if the registered A6.4 project applies an approved  standardized baseline that standardizes additionality and if the proposed or actual  changes affect the additionality of the project, the DOE shall determine whether the project  24 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  with the changes meets the additionality criteria (e.g. positive list of technologies) in the  applied standardized baseline. 105. The DOE shall determine whether the revised PDD complies with all the requirements of  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents. 106. If the applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines have been updated to a later  valid version of them, or changed to other methodologies or standardized baselines, the  DOE shall confirm that the revised PDD meets all requirements of the updated/changed  methodologies, including the standards, methodological tools and guidelines applied in  accordance with the updated/changed methodologies, and/or the updated/changed  standardized baselines. 107. The DOE shall confirm the date when the change occurred, the reasons for the change  and whether the change would have been known prior to the registration of the A6.4  project, and determine how the change would impact on the overall operation/ability of the  A6.4 project to deliver GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals as stated in the  registered PDD, and whether the revised estimation of GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals due to the change takes into account the applicable limits in accordance  with the activity standard. 108. In validating the revised PDD containing the proposed or actual change, and in preparing  the validation report, the DOE shall include information on how the findings of previous  verification and certification reports, if any, have been taken into account. 109. If the changes to the project design affect the identification, assessment or monitoring of  environmental, social or sustainable development impacts, the DOE shall assess whether  the impacts caused by the changes were assessed and revised versions of the A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form (if applicable) and A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form were provided. The DOE shall assess, prior to or as part of the first verification of  emission reductions or net removals, whether the revised A6.4 SD Tool forms are in  compliance with the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. 7.2.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme 110. The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to registration  under or coverage by a programme, under any other international, regional, national, or  subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme contained in the activity  standard based on the publicly available information and/or the information provided by  the activity participants upon its request. 7.3.

However, it is not applicable to:  (a) Uncertainties related to measurement;  (b) Addressing temporary deviations and permanent changes to the registered  monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines,  27 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  regardless of whether corresponding GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals are above or below materiality thresholds. 121. A DOE that plans and conducts verification using the concept of materiality shall achieve  a reasonable level of assurance that the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals are free from material errors, omissions or misstatements in accordance with  paragraphs 122−132 below. 122. An omission, misstatement, or erroneous reporting of information is material if it might  lead, at an aggregated level, to an overestimation of the total GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by a registered A6.4 project equal to or higher than the  following thresholds:  (a) 0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total  emission reduction or removal equal to or more than 500,000 t CO2 eq per year;19  (b) 1 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total  emission reduction or removal of between 300,000 and 500,000 t CO2 eq per year;  (c) 2 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total  emission reduction or removal of 300,000 t CO2 eq per year or less. 123. Recognizing that circumstances may exist that could cause the information reported by  activity participants to be materially misstated, the DOE should plan and perform  verifications with an attitude of professional scepticism and rely on its professional  judgement when applying the concept of materiality. 124. The application of the concept of materiality and reasonable level of assurance implies  that some data or information may not be checked. However, the DOE should design its  verification and sampling plans to detect all material errors, omissions or misstatements,  and any unchecked data or information should not contain any material errors, omissions  or misstatements. A DOE’s verification opinion applies to 100 per cent of the data and  information, even if the DOE may not have checked the entire data set and information. 125. Applying the concept of materiality does not mean that identified errors do not need to be  corrected; if an error, omission or misstatement is identified by the DOE, regardless of  whether it is material or not, the DOE shall request activity participants to address it. 8.1.4.2. Consideration of materiality in planning verification 126. The DOE should:  (a) Identify the materiality threshold referred to in paragraph 122 above that  corresponds to the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that  the specific registered A6.4 project will achieve;  (b) Understand the environment in which the registered A6.4 project operates, the  sources of project emissions within the project boundary and the leakage, the  monitoring activities, the equipment used to monitor or measure project data, the  origin and application of data used to calculate or measure the emissions, the data 19 A year refers in this paragraph to a period of 12 consecutive months.  28 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  flow, the internal quality control system, and the overall organization with respect  to monitoring and reporting;20  (c) Conduct a risk assessment to identify and assess the risks of individual or  aggregated material errors, omissions or misstatements that may occur within the  threshold based on elements in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above;  (d) Design verification plans, audit procedures21 and sampling plans whose type,  timing22 and extent are based on and are responsive to the assessed risks of  material errors, omissions or misstatements. 127. The materiality thresholds apply to the total GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals actually achieved. When planning verification, the DOE should apply the  applicable materiality threshold to the reported total emission reductions or removals. If,  as a result of the verification, the initial reported total emission reductions or removals is  revised, the DOE should reapply the materiality threshold to the revised total emission  reductions or removals and, if needed, make adjustments to its verification plans and  sampling plans. 8.1.4.3. Consideration of materiality in conducting verification 128. The DOE should:  (a) Apply verification plans, audit procedures and sampling plans;  (b) Assess potential errors, omissions and misstatements against the materiality  threshold to determine whether they are material individually or in aggregate and  whether further audit procedures are needed. 129. If an error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE should be aware that it may  not be an isolated occurrence and may be a systemic reoccurring error. For example,  other errors may exist if the DOE identifies that the error, omission or misstatement arose  from a breakdown in the activity participants’ internal quality control and quality assurance  system. 130. If an immaterial error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall request the  activity participants to address it and should determine whether additional audit  procedures should be conducted in order to reach a reasonable level of assurance that  the claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are free from material error,  omission or misstatement. 131. If a material error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall, depending on the  circumstances of the error, immediately request the activity participants to address it, or  conduct additional audit procedures to confirm or determine the context and magnitude of  the error, omission or misstatement and then request the activity participants to address  it. 20 Adapted from European Union. 2007. Commission Decision of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for  the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the  European Parliament and of the Council. 21 In accordance with section 8.1.5. 22 For example, timing may refer to the specific time intervals for which the DOE may draw its samples.  29 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 132. If further audit procedures are necessary, the DOE may consider whether the overall  verification plans and sampling plans need to be revised. 8.1.5. Standard auditing techniques 133. The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. 134. In assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of verification specified  throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including  but not limited to:  (a) Document review, involving:  (i) A review of data and information;  (ii) A review of the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological  regulatory documents, paying particular attention to the frequency of  measurements, the quality of metering equipment including calibration  requirements, and the quality assurance and quality control procedures;  (iii) An evaluation of data management and the quality assurance and quality  control system in the context of their influence on the generation and  reporting of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (b) Follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection and telephone or e-mail interviews),  including:  (i) An assessment of the implementation and operation of the registered A6.4  project as per the registered PDD or latest approved revised PDD;  (ii) A review of information flows for generating, aggregating and reporting the  monitoring parameters;  (iii) Interviews with relevant personnel to determine whether the operational and  data collection procedures are implemented in accordance with the  registered monitoring plan;  (iv) Cross checks between the information provided in the monitoring report and  data from other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase  records or similar data sources to determine whether the information in the  monitoring report is reliable;  (v) A check of the monitoring equipment including calibration performance and  observations of monitoring practices against the requirements of the  registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (vi) A review of calculations and assumptions made in determining the GHG data  and GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (vii) An identification of quality control and quality assurance procedures in place  to prevent, or identify and correct, any errors or omissions in the reported  monitoring parameters;  30 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) Sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for  Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body,  including:  (i) A random sampling for cases where the activity participants did not apply a  sampling approach for monitoring;  (ii) An acceptance sampling or another sampling approach for cases where the  activity participants applied a sampling approach for monitoring. 135. It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at verification for the  registered A6.4 project if:  (a) It is the first verification for the DOE with regard to this project;  (b) More than three years have elapsed since the last on-site inspection conducted for  verification for the project; or  (c) The project has achieved more than 300,000 t CO2 eq of GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals since the last verification when an on-site inspection was  conducted. 136. For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 135 above, it is optional for the DOE to  conduct an on-site inspection at verification. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site  inspection as a means of verification, it shall describe the alternative means used and  justify that they are sufficient for the purpose of verification. If the DOE conducts a remote  inspection as an alternative means to an on-site inspection, the DOE should follow the  guidance contained in Appendix 1. 137. If any issue related to the project design, including those attributable to the lack of on-site  inspection at previous verification, is identified at the verification, the DOE that detected  the issue shall rectify it through the post-registration change process in accordance with  the activity cycle procedure. 138. Where no specific means of verification is specified, the DOE should apply the standard  auditing techniques described in paragraph 134 above. 8.1.6. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests 139. If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order  to determine whether the implementation or the operation of the registered A6.4 project,  or the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals meets the relevant  Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues  are accurately identified, formulated, discussed and concluded in the verification and  certification report. 140. The DOE shall raise a CAR if one of the following situations occurs:  (a) Non-compliance with the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents is found in monitoring and reporting, and has not been sufficiently  documented by the activity participants, or if the evidence provided to prove  conformity is insufficient;  31 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) Modifications to the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 project, or  the monitoring or GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, has not been  sufficiently documented by the activity participants;  (c) Mistakes have been made by the activity participants in applying assumptions,  data or calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that may  impact the quantity of emission reductions or removals;  (d) Issues identified in a FAR during the validation or the previous verification(s) have  not been resolved by the activity participants. 141. The DOE shall raise a CL if the information provided by the activity participants is  insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism  rules and requirements have been met. 142. The DOE shall raise a FAR if issues related to monitoring and reporting that require  attention and/or adjustment at the next verification are identified. 143. The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify  the monitoring report, or provide additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s  concerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs. 144. The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its verification and certification report.  This reporting shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity  participants, the means of verification of such responses and references to any resulting  changes in the monitoring report or its supporting documents. 8.2. Verification of compliance with specific requirements for issuance 8.2.1. General 145. The DOE shall determine, by following the general verification requirements referred to in  sections 5 and 8.1 above, whether the monitoring complies with all relevant requirements  for monitoring as contained in the activity standard, including the requirements on:  (a) General requirements, including on:  (i) Implementation and operation of the project as per the description in the  registered PDD;  (ii) Continuous monitoring;  (iii) Coverage of the monitoring period;  (iv) Presentation of monitoring results by year of occurrence of GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals;  (v) Preparation of monitoring reports in chronological order and separation by  crediting periods;  (vi) Application of appropriate GWPs;  (vii) Maintenance of monitoring results;  (b) Avoidance of double issuance;  32 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) Description of implemented registered project;  (d) Description of monitoring system;  (e) Reversal related actions for projects involving removals and emission reduction  projects with reversal risks;  (f) Provision of data and parameters used;  (g) Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts;  (h) Calculation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.;  (i) Continuous engagement of stakeholders. 146. When verifying the compliance of the implementation and the operation of the registered  A6.4 project and monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals with the  requirements for implementation, operation and monitoring referred to in paragraph 145  above, the DOE shall additionally follow the specific guidance on verification regarding  some of these requirements provided in sections 8.2.2−8.2.10 below. 147. The DOE shall ensure, before submitting the request for first issuance for the project, that  the host Party statement of authorization of the use of A6.4ERs was provided. 8.2.2. Avoidance of double issuance 148. The DOE shall determine whether the A6.4 project is also registered, or covered by a  programme, under any other international, regional, national, or subnational GHG  mitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance based on the confirmation  from any other crediting scheme, if applicable, publicly available information and/or the  other information obtained from the activity participants. 149. If the DOE determines that the A6.4 project is registered, or covered by a programme,  under other crediting scheme, the DOE shall additionally determine whether the activity  participants have obtained a confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs  have not been or will not be credited under the other crediting scheme. 8.2.3. Project implementation and operation 150. The DOE shall identify any concerns related to the conformity of the implemented A6.4  project and its operation with the registered PDD and determine whether:  (a) The project has been implemented and is operating in accordance with the  description contained in the registered PDD; or  (b) Any deviation or the proposed or actual changes in the implementation or operation  of the project comply with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. 151. By means of an on-site inspection or other means of verification in accordance with  paragraphs 135 or 136 above, the DOE shall assess that all physical features (technology,  project equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the registered A6.4 project  specified in the registered PDD are in place and that the activity participants are operating  the project as per the registered PDD or latest approved revised PDD. 152. For each monitoring period, the DOE shall report:  33 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (a) The implementation status of the registered A6.4 project. For a project that consists  of more than one site, the DOE shall describe the status of implementation and the  starting date of operation for each site. For a project with phased implementation,  the DOE shall state the progress of the project achieved in each phase under  verification. If the phased implementation is delayed, the DOE shall describe the  reasons and present the expected implementation dates;  (b) The actual operation of the registered A6.4 project;  (c) The information (data and variables) provided in the monitoring report that is  different from that stated in the registered PDD or any latest approved revised  PDD, and has caused an increase in the estimates of GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals in the current monitoring period or is highly likely to increase  the estimates in future monitoring periods, if appliable;23  (d) An opinion on the cause of any increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project in the current  monitoring period that was reported in monitoring report, if applicable. 153. For projects that demonstrate additionality through investment analysis for which the PDD  was submitted for validation prior to the start date of the project, and for which the  investment analysis was not updated through the submission of a request for approval of  post-registration changes, the DOE, at the first verification, shall determine whether the  investment analysis has been updated based on the data and information for the  investment analysis available at the start date of the project in accordance with the  relevant provisions of the activity standard and other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 8.2.4. Monitoring plan 154. The DOE shall determine whether the registered monitoring plan is in accordance with the  applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents based on the actual implementation of the project. 155. For monitoring aspects that are not specified in the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the  DOE should highlight issues which may enhance the level of accuracy and completeness  of the registered monitoring plan. 8.2.5. Monitoring activities 156. The DOE shall determine whether:  (a) The registered monitoring plan has been properly implemented and followed by  the activity participants;  (b) All parameters stated in the registered monitoring plan have been monitored and  updated as applicable; 23 Discrepancies may include higher water availability than expected in the PDD, which may increase the  electricity output from a hydropower plant, or a higher plant load factor owing to higher bagasse  availability during the crushing season, which increases the production of steam and electricity.  34 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) The equipment used for monitoring is controlled and calibrated in accordance with  the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  local/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification;  (d) Monitoring results are consistently recorded as per the approved frequency;  (e) Quality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied in accordance  with the registered monitoring plan. 157. If the activity participants applied a sampling approach to determining data and  parameters monitored, the DOE shall assess the compliance of the sampling efforts and  surveys with the validated sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and  surveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 158. The DOE shall list each parameter required by the registered monitoring plan and state  how it verified the information flow (from data generation and aggregation, to recording,  calculation and reporting) for these parameters including the values in the monitoring  report. 159. For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report includes the following specific  elements as per the activity standard and the respective provisions of the removals  standard and any applied methodological regulatory documents:  (a) Description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) Estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the  monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;  (d) Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could  have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions along with a  summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period  covered by the monitoring report;  (e) Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent  with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered PDD;  (f) Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been  assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the  registered PDD. 8.2.6. Calibration frequency for measuring instruments 160. The DOE shall determine whether the calibration of the measuring equipment that has an  impact on the claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is conducted by  the activity participants at the frequency specified in the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents  or the registered monitoring plan. 161. If, during the verification for a certain monitoring period, the DOE identifies that the  calibration has been delayed and the calibration has been implemented after the  35 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  monitoring period in consideration (i.e. the results of delayed calibration are available),  referring to the illustrative examples in Appendix 2, the DOE may conclude its verification,  provided the following conservative approach is adopted in the calculation of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals:  (a) Applying the maximum permissible error24 of the instrument to the measured  values taken during the period between the scheduled date of calibration and the  actual date of calibration, if the results of the delayed calibration do not show any  errors in the measuring equipment, or if the error is smaller than the maximum  permissible error; or  (b) Applying the error identified in the delayed calibration test, if the error is beyond  the maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment. 162. The DOE shall confirm that the error has been applied:  (a) In a conservative manner, such that the adjusted measured values of the delayed  calibration shall result in fewer claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals;  (b) For all measured values taken during the period between the scheduled date of  calibration and the actual date of calibration. 163. If the results of the delayed calibration are not available, or the calibration has not been  conducted at the time of the verification, the DOE, prior to finalizing the verification, shall  request the activity participants to conduct the required calibration and shall determine  whether the activity participants have calculated GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals conservatively using the approach mentioned in paragraph 161 above. 164. If the DOE determines that it is not possible for the activity participants to conduct the  calibration at the frequency specified in the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents, or the  registered monitoring plan due to reasons beyond the control of the activity participants,25  the DOE shall follow the applicable requirements related to post-registration changes in  section 7 above. 165. If neither the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied  methodological regulatory documents, nor the registered monitoring plan specify any  requirements for calibration frequency for the measuring equipment, the DOE shall  determine whether the equipment is calibrated either in accordance with the specifications  of the local/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification. If neither  local/national standards nor the manufacturer’s specification are available, the DOE shall  determine whether the equipment is calibrated in accordance with the specifications of the  international standards. 24 The  maximum permissible errors of all the measuring instruments are specified by the respective  manufacturers as part of their technical specifications. 25 For example, due to the contractual terms between the activity participant and purchasing/selling entities.  36 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 8.2.7. Reversal related actions for projects involving removals and emission reduction  projects with reversal risks 166. In cases of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that could potentially  lead to reversal, the DOE shall determine on the basis of transparent and verifiable  evidence whether the event as per the preliminary assessment report, prepared in  accordance with the requirements of the activity standard, respective provisions of the  removals standard on reversal-related actions and any other relevant applied  methodological regulatory documents, results in an actual reversal or not. 167. If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the  preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual  reversal and a monitoring report is prepared, the DOE shall determine whether the  monitoring report is in compliance with requirements of the activity standard, respective  provisions of the removals standard, and any other relevant applied methodological  regulatory documents. 168. The DOE shall also assess whether the monitoring report accurately estimates the  magnitude of reversals and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable. 169. The DOE shall also assess whether, following the submission of the monitoring report:  (a) The risk assessment of the activity has been updated and the risk rating of the  activity has been revised;  (b) The compliance with requirements and safeguards contained in the Article 6.4 SD  Tool, taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts caused  by the reversal and plans developed to prevent the recurrence of such negative  environmental and social impacts, has been reviewed. 8.2.8. Data and calculation of emission reductions or net removals 170. The DOE shall assess the data and calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project and determine whether:  (a) A complete set of data for the specified monitoring period is available. If only partial  data is available because activity levels or non-activity parameters have not been  monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan, the DOE shall assess  whether:  (i) The most conservative values approach is applied to the parameters for the  entire non-monitoring period in accordance with the provisions relating to  temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied  methodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard;  or  (ii) Alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-monitoring period are  described, whether they apply conservative assumptions or discount factors  to the calculations, and whether the alterative monitoring arrangements have  been approved by the Supervisory Body under the prior-approval track or to  be approved by the Supervisory Body under the issuance track in  accordance with the provisions relating to temporary deviation from the  registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied  37 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  standardized baselines in the activity standard and the activity cycle  procedure;  (b) The information provided in the monitoring report has been cross-checked with  other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase records and  laboratory analysis;  (c) The calculations of baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals,  project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals, and leakage GHG emissions  have been carried out in accordance with the formulae and methods described in  the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (d) Where projects involving removals also result in emission reductions, the  accounting of removals and emission reductions has been separated in the  monitoring report in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity;  (e) Any assumptions used in emission or removal calculations have been justified;  (f) Appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values, GWPs and other reference  values have been correctly applied;  (g) If the project applies an approved standardized baseline that standardizes baseline  emissions, the standardized values of the parameters have been applied using the  correct version of the applied standardized baseline in accordance with the activity  standard. 171. The DOE shall provide:  (a) An indication of whether a complete set of data for the monitoring period was not  available because activity levels or non-activity parameters were not monitored in  accordance with the registered monitoring plan, and if so, whether the most  conservative values approach was applied or alternative monitoring arrangements  were proposed or have been approved by the Supervisory Body;  (b) A description of how the DOE cross-checked reported data;  (c) A confirmation that appropriate methods and formulae for calculating baseline  GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals, project GHG emissions or actual  net GHG removals and leakage GHG emissions have been followed;  (d) An opinion on whether assumptions, emission factors and default values that were  applied in the calculations have been justified. 8.2.9. Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts 172. The DOE shall verify the appropriateness, relevance and sufficiency of information  provided in the monitoring of the environmental and social indicators in the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators  in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, as reported in a monitoring report. 173. If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in the A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form that  were validated at registration, it shall provide its opinion to the activity participants on the  38 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and  environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form  and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 174. The DOE shall review any input and comments received via the continuous engagement  of local stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, conduct interviews with local  stakeholders and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post fulfilment  of risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity. 175. The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and  reported parameters established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form submitted at the registration  stage. 176. For projects that successfully transitioned from the clean development mechanism (CDM)  and that prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits description report” in  accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool” at the time of transition,  the DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report includes the outcome of the  monitoring of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on the  document describing how the activity participant monitors sustainable development co-  benefits of the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring results, in  accordance with relevant provisions of the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the  Article 6.4 mechanism”. 8.2.10. Continuous engagement of stakeholders 177. If the activity participants have received comments on the implementation or operation of  the A6.4 project from local stakeholders after its registration through the process of  continuous engagement of stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE  shall determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the  comments in the implementation or operation of the project, as appropriate. 178. The DOE shall also determine whether comments on the compliance of the registered  A6.4 project with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and regulations have been  submitted from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations and  published on the UNFCCC website in accordance with the activity cycle procedure, and if  so, determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the  comments. 8.3. Verification and certification report 179. The DOE shall report the results of its assessment in the verification and certification  report, including:  (a) An executive summary of the verification process and its conclusions;  (b) Details of the verification team, technical experts, internal reviewers involved,  together with their roles in the verification activity and, where conducted in  accordance with paragraph 135 or 136 above, details of who conducted the on-  site inspection;  (c) A list of interviewees, documents reviewed, sampling approaches used by the DOE  and, where conducted in accordance with paragraph 135 or 136 above, an outline  39 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  of the on-site inspection. If the DOE applied a sampling approach to the on-site  inspection, the DOE shall include a description of how the sample size was  determined and how the field check was carried out;  (d) Results of the dialogue between the DOE and the activity participants, as well as  any adjustments made to the monitoring report following the continuous  engagement of stakeholders;  (e) The applied approach, finding and conclusion in the assessment of compliance  with each requirement for issuance conducted in accordance with sections 8.1‒8.2  above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the activity participants and how  they have been addressed by them;  (f) A list of each parameter specified by the registered monitoring plan and a  statement on how the values in the monitoring report have been verified;  (g) A statement on whether any post-registration changes to the registered PDD have  been approved by the Supervisory Body or will be submitted together with the  request for issuance of A6.4ERs;  (h) An assessment of remaining issues from the previous verification period, if  appropriate;  (i) Information on quality control within the team and in the verification process;  (j) A verification opinion, providing:  (i) A summary of the verification method and the process used and the  verification criteria applied;  (ii) A conclusion on the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals achieved. 180. Where the DOE applied the concept of materiality in planning and conducting verification  for the registered A6.4 project in accordance with section 8.1.4 above, it shall report:  (a) The risks, the risk assessment undertaken and how the verification plans and  sampling plans were designed to respond to these risks and ensure that all material  errors, omissions or misstatements were detected;  (b) Whether and how the verification plans and sampling plans were revised to take  into account the need for further audit procedures due to the nature/type of errors,  omissions or misstatements detected;  (c) How the concept of materiality was applied in determining whether a detected  error, omission or misstatement was material or immaterial either individually or in  aggregate. 181. The DOE shall describe all documentation supporting the verification and make it available  on request. 182. The DOE shall, based on its verification, certify in writing, that the registered A6.4 project  achieved the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net anthropogenic GHG  40 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  removals during the specified monitoring period that would not have occurred in the  absence of the project.26 183. If the DOE identifies unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the parameters  established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4  Sustainable development impact form and cannot be remediated by consultation or  mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion or submit a deviation request  to the Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance. 184. The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the verification outcome, which will be one  of the following options:  (a) A positive verification opinion with verified amount of GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals, and the date of submission of the verification and certification  report as part of the request for issuance of A6.4ERs to the secretariat; or  (b) A negative verification opinion, including the reasons for the monitoring results, as  documented, having been determined as not complying with the relevant  requirements for issuance. 9. Validation for renewal of crediting period 9.1. General requirements 9.1.1. Overarching requirement 185. The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have updated the PDD in  accordance with the relevant requirements for renewal of the crediting period in the activity  standard. 9.1.2. Other requirements 186. If the activity participants used a later valid version of the PDD form for the updated PDD  than the version of the form of the registered PDD, the DOE shall determine whether the  information transferred to the later valid version of the PDD form is materially the same as  that in the registered PDD. 9.2. Validation of compliance with specific requirements for renewal 9.2.1. General 187. The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in  sections 5 and 6.1 above mutatis mutandis and section 9.1 above, whether the proposed  renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project complies with all relevant  requirements for renewal contained in the activity standard, including the requirements on:  (a) Application of valid version of the methodologies and methodological tools;  (b) Application of an approved standardized baseline; 26 The certification report constitutes a request to the Supervisory Body for issuance of A6.4ERs equal to  the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.  41 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) Validity of the original baseline or its update;  (d) Update of the BAU scenario and emissions, the baseline scenario and emissions,  and the difference between the baseline and BAU emissions;  (e) Update of the downwards adjustment;  (f) Update of the regulatory analysis for the additionality;  (g) Update of the estimated GHG emissions and net GHG removals (if applicable);  (h) Update of the monitoring plan (if applicable);  (i) Update of the A6.4 SD Tool forms;  (j) Updated risk assessment and monitoring plan for projects involving removals and  emission reduction projects with reversal risks;  (k) Update of the crediting period;  (l) Update of MoC statement;  (m) Combination of post-registration change at renewal, if applicable. 9.2.2. Application of valid version of the methodologies and methodological tools 188. If the activity participants selected another methodology, methodological tool and/or  standardized baseline for the purpose of renewal of the crediting period of the registered  A6.4 project due to the inapplicability of the valid version of the methodology (including a  consolidated methodology thereof), methodological tool and/or standardized baseline  applied to the registered PDD, the DOE shall assess whether the updated PDD complies  with all the requirements of the selected methodology, methodological tool and/or  standardized baseline. 189. If the activity participants deviated from the valid version of the methodology (including a  consolidated methodology thereof) and/or methodological tool applied in the registered  PDD, or from any other selected methodology and/or methodological tool for the purpose  of renewal of the crediting period of the registered A6.4 project, paragraphs 42‒43 above  shall apply mutatis mutandis. 9.2.3. Validity of original baseline or its update 190. The DOE shall assess the validity of the original baseline or its update through an  assessment of the correctness of the application of the approved methodologies and,  where applicable, the approved standardized baselines and the other methodological  regulatory documents for the determination of the continued validity of the baseline or its  update, and the estimation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the  applicable crediting period of the registered A6.4 project. 9.2.4. Update of modalities of communication statement 191. The DOE shall confirm that the names of the activity participants included in the updated  PDD are consistent with the names of the activity participants in the latest version of the  MoC statement.  42 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 9.2.5. Combination of post-registration change at renewal 192. If the activity participants requested approval of post-registration changes together with  the request for renewal of the crediting period of the registered A6.4 project, the DOE shall  also validate the post-registration changes in accordance with the relevant requirements  in section 7 above and the activity cycle procedure, and shall submit a request for approval  of post-registration changes together with the request for renewal of the crediting period  of the project in accordance with the relevant requirements in the activity cycle procedure. 9.3. Validation report 193. In its validation report for the renewal of the crediting period, the DOE shall:  (a) Report on all items listed in paragraph 82 above except for subparagraph 82(e);  (b) Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusions on the assessment of:  (i) Whether the revised PDD was prepared using the valid version of the  applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable;  (ii) The compliance of the updated project design with the requirements for  renewal of the crediting period conducted in accordance with sections 9.1‒  9.2 above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the activity  participants and how they have been addressed by them;  (c) State whether there are any proposed post-registration changes effective from the  start date of the next crediting period in the request for renewal of the crediting  period of the project, if the validation is primarily for the latter.  43 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 Appendix 1. Guidance on remote inspection as an  alternative means to an on-site inspection 1. In this document, a remote inspection for the purpose of validation or verification refers to  the activities where the validation or verification team of the designated operational entity  (DOE) carries out the same activities as in a physical on-site inspection through  information and communication technologies (ICT) tools. 2. There are risks posed by remote inspections, including in the use of ICT tools. In order to  ensure a level of assurance of the validation or verification as comparable as in an on-site  inspection, there needs to be measures in place to reduce these risks. 3. The DOE should identify risks pertaining to the remote inspection for each validation or  verification activity and establish and implement measures to eliminate or reduce those  risks. A DOE should also integrate this risk assessment process into its quality  management systems. 4. The DOE should implement the following actions at different stages of a validation or  verification activity:  (a) Risk assessment stage: The feasibility of conducting a remote inspection depends  on the risk level and whether measures to eliminate or reduce the risks are  adequate for the validation or verification. Therefore, a risk assessment to be  conducted by the DOE should cover the aspects below:  (i) Identifying and assessing the risks inherent in a remote inspection. The risks  may be at different levels and could cover different aspects; hence the risk  identification and assessment should cover:  a. Risks related to organizational and procedural aspects, which include  generic risks. These risks could relate to the following: the quality of  the internet connection; the quality of ICT tools such as good  camerawork to ensure a reasonably good view for the validation or  verification team; the amount of documentation to be reviewed  remotely; whether relevant data flows can be accessed remotely;  what record-keeping system is established; the maintaining of  confidentiality and personnel data protection; and the required  competence and resources of the validation or verification team;  b. Risks related to the project and its configuration, which present  project-specific risks: The risks could relate to the following: whether  the boundary and features of the project can be evaluated remotely;  whether the remote inspection would enable the DOE to observe any  sources of emissions that are not included in the project; how control  activities are carried out; and how calculations are tracked and cross-  checked;  c. Risks related to monitoring aspects: The risks could relate to the  following: the complexity of the monitoring parameters and the  monitoring plan; data processing and reporting; whether a fiscal  metering method is applied; the sampling or surveys conducted at  household level; what status of the monitoring period is being  44 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0  verified; and whether data and information have been thoroughly  checked during previous verifications or whether such data and  information can be checked subsequently without an on-site  inspection;  (ii) Establishing measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. The DOE  should establish measures to eliminate or reduce each identified risk at  different levels described in subparagraph (i) above;  (iii) The risk assessment pertaining to the remote inspection may be done in the  context of the application of materiality following the relevant provisions in  this standard;  (b) Planning stage: Based on risk assessment outcomes, the DOE should plan the  validation or verification activity as follows:  (i) Composing a validation or verification team with sufficient members that  have the knowledge, skill and solid professional judgement required in an  on-site inspection in conjunction with additional competence in applying ICT  tools;  (ii) Conducting a desk review to gain a prior understanding of records and  documentation control processes of the project participants;  (iii) Establishing a validation or verification plan to clearly define the tasks to be  done during the remote inspection, taking into account the established  measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. This includes a detailed  allocation of responsibilities by different validation or verification team  members with the required knowledge and specific time zones to ensure the  team members audit separately and make the best use of time;  (iv) Determining ICT tools to be used with the activity participants and conducting  a test on the agreed ICT tools before the remote inspection to ensure that  there is a stable connection and understanding of how to use such ICT tools.  The DOE should also ensure that there is a backup plan in case there is a  connection issue;  (c) Implementation stage: During the remote inspection, the DOE should implement  measures it has established to mitigate the identified risks, while conducting the  validation or verification following the relevant requirements of this standard. At this  stage, the DOE may decide to extend or terminate the remote inspection if it finds  during the remote inspection that the actual risks are higher than initially assessed.  (d) Post-remote inspection stage: the DOE should:  (i) Assess whether another round of remote inspection is needed while  reviewing the activity participants’ responses to clarification requests,  corrective action requests and/or forward action requests;  (ii) Ensure that its technical review process is able to identify any risks that were  not identified during the risk assessment stage.  45 of 47  A6.4-STAN-AC-003 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects Version 02.0 Appendix 2. Calibration 1. The following provides an illustrative example for applying the provisions in paragraph  161(a) and (b) of this standard. 2. An electricity energy meter with a maximum permissible error (±5%), which may be used  for measuring the electricity export for baseline emissions and electricity import for project  emission calculations, is required to be calibrated every year. If the calibration is delayed  and instead of after one year it is conducted after one and a half years, and the result of  the delayed calibration is available at the time of verification, to account for the delayed  calibration the measured values shall be corrected as demonstrated in the following  Table 1 and Table 2 for situations stipulated in paragraph 161(a) and (b) of this standard.  Table 1.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The Supervisory Body, at its thirteenth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 activity standard  for programme of activities” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that set out the  requirements relating to the design, implementation and other attributes of Article 6.4  mechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and of component projects (CPs). 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of  Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies  standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article  6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article  6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two  standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas  the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have  met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental  risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to  sustainable development in line with the sustainable development objectives and priorities  of the host Party and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 1.2. Objectives 5. The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to the design,  implementation and other attributes of A6.4 PoAs and of CPs that may be included in  registered A6.4 PoAs. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

The activity participants shall define for the proposed A6.4 PoA their modalities of  communication with the Supervisory Body and the secretariat and present them in a  Modalities of Communication (MoC) statement in accordance with the activity cycle  procedure. 6.12. Generic component project 6.12.1. General requirements 36. As part of the PoA-DD for the proposed A6.4 PoA, the activity participants shall prepare a  generic CP-DD. The generic CP-DD shall:  (a) Describe the technologies/measures to be deployed and/or implemented by the  corresponding CPs, including a description of their common features;  (b) Define the conditions and circumstances under which technologies/measures may  be included as CPs in the PoA by establishing eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs  in the PoA;  (c) Specify how the corresponding CPs are to be designed to ensure that they comply  with all applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, including the  11 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  requirements in this standard and in the applied methodologies and, where  applicable, the applied standardized baselines. 37. For a proposed A6.4 PoA applying more than one technology/measure or more than one  methodology, the activity participants shall prepare a generic CP-DD for each  technology/measure, each methodology and each combination thereof.8 38. The activity participants shall consider any specific guidance in the applied methodologies  regarding the requirement to prepare a separate generic CP-DD for each  technology/measure, taking into account differences in the means of demonstration of  additionality, GHG emission reductions or net GHG removal calculations, and monitoring  methods applicable to the technologies/measures being implemented. 6.12.2. General description 39. The activity participants shall describe the generic CP in the generic CP-DD. When  describing the generic CP, the activity participants shall provide, inter alia, the following  information:  (a) The purpose of the generic CP;  (b) The confirmation that the generic CP is within the types of A6.4 activities that the  host Party indicated that it would approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of  the RMPs;  (c) The geographical boundary;  (d) The technologies/measures to be deployed and/or implemented by the  corresponding CPs, including:  (i) A list of the facilities, systems and equipment that will be installed and/or  modified by the corresponding CPs;  (ii) The types and levels of services9 provided by the facilities, systems and  equipment and their relation, if any, to other facilities, systems and equipment  outside the project boundary;  (iii) The arrangement of the facilities, systems and equipment;  (iv) The range of the age and average lifetime of the facilities, systems and  equipment based on the manufacturer’s specifications and industry  standards;  (v) The range of the installed capacities, load factors and efficiencies; 8 For instance, a PoA for energy-efficiency activities applying a single methodology but including different  technologies will need more than one generic CP-DD (e.g. a generic CP-DD for efficient street lighting  and a generic CP-DD for efficient water pumping). However, separate generic CP-DDs are not required  to cover cases that do not differ in terms of GHG emission reduction calculations (e.g. separate generic  CP-DDs are not required for installing cookstoves of efficiency N by manufacturer M1 versus installing  prefabricated cookstoves of efficiency N by manufacturer M2). 9 Examples of “types and levels of services” include the amount of a certain type of cement produced or  the amount of electricity fed into the electricity grid.  12 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (vi) The energy and mass flows and balances of the facilities, systems and  equipment, if necessary;  (vii) The monitoring equipment and their location in the systems;  (e) The technologies/measures existing prior to the implementation of the  corresponding CPs at the same sites, as applicable, including the equivalent  information listed in subparagraph (d) above on the facilities, systems and  equipment;  (f) A summary of the baseline scenario as established in accordance with 6.12.6  below, including the equivalent information listed in subparagraph (d) above.  (g) An indication for each generic CP as to how the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool  will be applied at CP level and how the analysis of the environmental and social  impacts and sustainable development impacts will be conducted at the CP level in  accordance with the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool, and how the environmental,  social and sustainable development impacts will be monitored. 6.12.3. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 40. The activity participants shall select methodologies that have been approved by the  Supervisory Body and that are valid,10 applicable to the generic CP and, if applicable,  compatible with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party  in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 41. In selecting a methodology for the generic CP, the activity participants may:  (a) Propose a new methodology in accordance with the “Procedure: Development,  revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”;  (b) Propose a revision to an approved methodology or methodological tool in  accordance with the procedure referred to in subparagraph 41(a) above;  (c) Seek clarification on the applicability of an approved methodology or  methodological tool in accordance with the procedure referred to in subparagraph  41(a) above; or  (d) Request clarification of acceptability of deviation from an approved methodology  or methodological tool in accordance with the procedure referred to in  subparagraph 41(a) above. 6.12.4. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 42. The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC  reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized  baselines that are applied to the generic CP, including any other methodologies or  methodological tools to which the selected methodologies refer. 10 The valid version of a mechanism methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the  submission of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA to the secretariat in accordance with  the activity cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance  with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.  13 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 43. The activity participants shall demonstrate why the selected methodologies, standardized  baselines, and any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines  applied in accordance with the selected methodologies (hereinafter “any other standards,  methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines (to be) applied in accordance with the  selected (applied) methodologies” are collectively referred to as the other applied  methodological regulatory documents) are applicable to the generic CP by showing that  the generic CP meets all applicability conditions of these regulatory documents and, if  applicable, are compatible with the methodological requirements that may be specified by  the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 44. The activity participants shall ensure that the design of the generic CP complies with all  the requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and  the other applied methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the  methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with  paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 45. The activity participants may apply combinations of multiple methodologies for the  proposed A6.4 PoA using one of the options below if the generic CPs apply a combination  of technologies/measures that are not covered by a single methodology:  (a) The same combination of technologies/measures under the same combination of  methodologies are applied consistently in every CP in the PoA;  (b) A principal technology/measure is used consistently in all CPs in the PoA, applying  different combinations of methodologies to different CPs; or  (c) Combinations of technologies/measures and/or methodologies vary across CPs in  the PoA and the implementation of activities through CPs is integrated through the  design of the PoA.11 46. In any of the options referred to in paragraph 45 above, the activity participants shall either:  (a) Demonstrate that no cross-effects exist between the technologies/measures by  following the instructions provided in Appendix 3; or  (b) If cross-effects exist, take them into account in the calculation of GHG emission  reductions. 47. For the purpose of meeting the requirement referred to in paragraph 46 above, the activity  participants may:  (a) Seek clarification from the Supervisory Body on the existence of cross-effects or  how they should be taken into account in the calculation of GHG emission  reductions in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and  clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”; or  (b) Propose a revision to the applied methodologies in accordance with the procedure  referred to in subparagraph (a) above to take into account the identified cross  effects. 11 For example, the PoA involves different GHG emission reduction activities as part of a city-wide effort  that includes different measures such as energy production, transport, energy efficiency and waste  management, or the PoA involves the installation of renewable electricity systems, which may include  grid-connected and off-grid systems, by providing financial incentives for the installation of these  systems.  14 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 6.12.5. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases 48. The activity participants shall describe how to define the project boundary of each of the  corresponding CPs, including the physical delineation of the project using Global  Positioning System (GPS) coordinates as appropriate, and which sources, sinks and  GHGs are included in the project boundary in accordance with the applied methodologies  and the applied standardized baselines. In this context, project boundary is a physical  delineation or geographical area that encompasses GHGs and sources under the control  of the activity participants and that are significant and reasonably attributable to the  corresponding CP in accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable,  the applied standardized baselines. 49. If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity  participants to choose whether a source, sink or GHG is to be included in the project  boundary, the activity participants shall explain and justify the choice. 6.12.6. Baseline scenario 50. The activity participants shall describe how to establish the baseline scenario for each of  the corresponding CPs in accordance with the applied methodologies, standardized  baselines, other applied methodological regulatory documents, the provisions in  paragraph 51 below and/or a more ambitious baseline requirement determined by the host  Party and approved by the Supervisory Body and, where applicable, the baseline  approaches specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 51. When describing how to establish the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee  that future emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to the  specific circumstances of the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed  demand in the applied methodology or propose a revision to an approved methodology to  cover such scenario if it is not covered in the methodology. 52. If the generic CP applies an approved standardized baseline that standardizes the  baseline scenario, the activity participants shall describe the baseline scenario as per the  applied standardized baseline. 6.12.7. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 53. The activity participants shall describe how to identify the business-as-usual (BAU)  scenario or reference benchmark emissions in the generic CP-DD in accordance with the  applied methodologies or other applied methodological regulatory documents. 6.12.8. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals 54. The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex post calculation of  baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as the modalities  for estimating the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by each  of the corresponding CPs in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents. If the  generic CP contains more than one component or applies more than one methodology,  the activity participants shall apply this requirement for each component and/or  methodology separately. The activity participants shall describe all steps to be undertaken  for these calculations.  15 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 55. For generic CPs developed for activities involving removals that also result in emission  reductions, the estimation of removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the  generic CP-DD in accordance with the methodology(ies) applicable to the generic CP. 56. The activity participants shall describe in the generic CP-DD the steps to calculate the  difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the crediting  period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward adjustment  based on BAU. 57. The activity participants shall describe in the generic CP-DD how to determine whether  the baseline must be adjusted downward as per the guidance below:  (a) The activity participants shall describe in the generic CP-DD how to identify the  factors and quantitative methods for downward adjustment and update them at  each renewal of the crediting period, in accordance with paragraphs 57(b) and  57(c) below. Activity participants shall also describe how more stringent factors or  quantitative methods determined by the host Parties for downward adjustment,  according to their circumstances, are applied;  (b) The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers the  economic viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and  decarbonization technologies, and negative emission approaches while ensuring  that methodologies are aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris  Agreement, and may be operationalized through:  (i) Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies  approved by the Supervisory Body that may be proposed by activity  participants or stakeholders;12  (ii) Factors or quantitative methods jointly developed by the Supervisory Body  and the host Party;  (iii) Factors or quantitative methods developed by the host Party that are  specified to the Supervisory Body for approval;  (c) If the downward adjustment based on the BAU referred to in paragraph 56 above  is greater than the downward adjustment determined based on paragraph 57(b)  above, no further adjustment to the baseline is required to be made in the  corresponding CP-DD; otherwise the generic CP-DD shall require further  adjustment to align with the result of paragraphs 57(a) and 57(b) above to ensure  consistency with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMPs, in accordance  with other applied methodological regulatory documents. 58. The activity participants shall describe how to determine leakage emissions in the generic  CP-DD through:  (a) Identifying all potential sources of leakage that may reasonably be attributable to  corresponding CPs following the applicable methodology and other applied 12 Activity participants or stakeholders may propose factors or quantitative methods for the consideration  of the Supervisory Body in consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being  involved. If a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the procedures for the  standardized baselines shall be applied. See here https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-  PROC-METH-002.pdf  16 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  methodological regulatory documents. If any of the sources of leakage is excluded  from consideration, proper justification shall be provided in the generic CP-DD;  (b) Identifying how each of the sources of leakage above will be avoided or minimized  following the applicable methodology and other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (c) Justifying how information from the designated national authority (DNA) of the host  Party on leakage will be taken into account as per the application of other applied  methodological regulatory documents. 59. If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied  methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide  different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify  their choice. 60. The activity participants shall use the valid version of the norms, specifications, standards  and test procedures referred to in the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, as available at the  time of submission of the PoA-DD to a DOE for validation. 61. The activity participants shall, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  provide identification of the data and parameters that will not be monitored but will be  determined before the CP inclusion in the proposed A6.4 PoA individually for each CP and  remain fixed throughout the crediting period of the CP. 62. The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the corresponding CPs results in  conservative estimates. 63. The activity participants may use sampling for the determination of parameter values for  calculating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals if the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents allow this. In such cases, the activity participants shall develop and describe a  sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for Article 6.4  mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 6.12.9.

Avoidance of double or revived inclusion or registration 80. If the CP is the case referred to in paragraph 72(d)(ii) above, the activity participants shall  obtain a confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of deregistration  or exclusion from the other crediting scheme and the remaining crediting period under the  other crediting scheme at the time of deregistration or exclusion. 81. If the CP is the case referred to in paragraph 72(d)(iii) above, the activity participants shall  obtain a confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of the  registration or coverage, the start and end dates of the crediting period of the CP, and the  monitoring periods for which credits have been issued under the other crediting scheme. 82. If the CP was a CP that has been excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity  participants shall ensure that:  (a) The CP-DD transparently declares that the project was a CP that has been  previously excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to  erroneous inclusion;  (b) The crediting period type (i.e. renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting  period are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of  the exclusion, noting that A6.4ERs may be claimed for the period only after the  effective date of inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA as per the activity  cycle procedure, and:  (i) If the crediting period is renewable, the DOE shall upload the relevant  documentation for including the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA within one  year of the end date of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of the  exclusion, noting that missing the deadline no longer allows for the inclusion  of the CP;  (ii) If the crediting period is fixed, the DOE shall upload the relevant  documentation for including the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA prior to the  end date of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of the exclusion,  noting that missing the deadline no longer allows the inclusion of the CP;  (c) The CP meets all relevant requirements for inclusion of CPs valid at the time when  the DOE uploads the relevant documentation for including the CP in the registered  A6.4 PoA;  (d) If the CP applies a methodology that potentially accrues negative GHG emission  reductions, GHG emission reductions have been continuously monitored in 18 The geographical location includes the project boundary excluding the location of non-project-specific  equipment such as electricity grid and district heating. It does not apply to distributed unit projects in  which the project boundary consists of a region.  23 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  accordance with the monitoring plan as described in the CP-DD and verified by a  DOE since the end of the monitoring period in the last published monitoring report  that covered the CP, including the exclusion period. For such CP, if there were net  negative GHG emission reductions during the period before the inclusion of the CP  in the registered A6.4 PoA, the amount shall be deducted from the first requests  for issuance of A6.4ERs after the inclusion of the CP. 83. The activity participants shall declare, if applicable, the existence of a registered A6.4  project, another CP under a registered A6.4 PoA or an activity under any other  international, regional, national or subnational GHG mitigation crediting scheme whose  crediting period has or has not expired (hereinafter referred to as former project) in the  same geographical location as that of the CP. 84. If the activity participants identify that the CP is in the same geographical location as that  of a former project, it shall declare that the CP will not lead to the discontinuation or  modification of the former project and does not decrease the GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals by the former project, and that the CP complies with the following  conditions:  (a) It utilizes both a different measure and a different technology from those of the  former project;  (b) It does not share or utilize any of the assets of the former project;  (c) It utilizes a different resource type compared to the former project. 85. The following definitions shall apply for paragraph 84 above:  (a) Measure: fuel/feedstock switch, technology switch, methane destruction and  methane avoidance;  (b) Technology: equipment or conversion process used for the production of goods or  provision of services. Two technologies are considered to be the same  technologies if they:  (i) Provide the same kind of output and use the same kind of equipment and  conversion process; or  (ii) Undertake the same course of action that results in the same kind of effect;  (c) Assets: resources with economic value that an individual, corporation or country  owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide future benefit; the assets  could be physical such as project equipment, or non-corporeal such as permits and  exclusive position in legislation. The definition of assets in this context excludes  land;  (d) Output: the amount of goods or services produced by a technology;  (e) Resource: a source of supply or support needed for the production of an output. It  may include categories of goods, energy and energy carriers that are supplied into  the project location and are required for the implementation of the CP, such as  fossil fuel, by-product of a process, biomass, solar, wind, or geothermal heat. 86. If the CP involves the implementation of distributed units in households and the conditions  referred to in paragraph 84 above are not met, the activity participants shall request a DOE  to validate and confirm by other means that the CP will not lead to the discontinuation or  24 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  modification of the former project, and does not decrease the GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals by the former project, in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation  and verification standard for programmes of activities” (hereinafter referred to as the  validation and verification standard). 87. In all other cases, the activity participants may submit a communication to the Supervisory  Body to request clarification prior to the inclusion of the CP in the registered PoA. 7.4. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 88. The activity participants shall select methodologies for the CP in accordance with the  generic CP. If a methodology applied to the generic CP has been revised by the  Supervisory Body, the validity of the version of the methodology and the necessity of post-  registration change to the registered A6.4 PoA to apply the new version of the  methodology prior to the inclusion of the CP shall follow the corresponding rules for validity  of methodology contained in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of  methodologies and methodological tools”. 89. If an applicable standardized baseline is available for the CP, the mandatory or optional  selection of the standardized baseline shall be in accordance with the generic CP. If the  generic CP does not refer to the selection of a standardized baseline but an applicable  standardized baseline is available at the time of the inclusion of the CP in the registered  A6.4 PoA, the activity participants shall or may select the standardized baseline depending  on the mandatory19 or optional conditions for its selection, provided that the development  of the standardized baseline is consistent with the approach to setting a baseline  described in the generic CP. 7.5. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 7.5.1. General requirements 90. The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC  reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized  baselines that are applied to the CP, including any other methodologies or methodological  tools to which the selected methodologies refer, in accordance with the generic CP. 91. The activity participants shall demonstrate that the CP meets all conditions of the eligibility  criteria referred to in paragraph 72(h) above that ensure compliance with the applicability  of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological requirements  that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 7.5.2. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases 92. The activity participants shall describe the project boundary of the CP, including the  physical delineation of the CP using GPS coordinates as appropriate, and which sources,  sinks and GHGs are included in the project boundary in accordance with the applied 19 As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to revise the PoA-DD in  order to apply a mandatory standardized baseline that becomes available after the registration of the  PoA and before a renewal of the PoA period. However, the activity cycle procedure also specifies that  no new CPs can be included in the PoA until a post-registration change to the PoA to reflect the  requirements of the standardized baseline is approved by the Supervisory Body.  25 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  methodologies and the applied standardized baselines, in accordance with the modalities  in the generic CP as per paragraph 48 above. In this context, the project boundary is a  physical delineation or geographical area that encompasses GHGs and sources under the  control of the activity participants and that are significant and reasonably attributable to  the CP in accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable, the applied  standardized baselines. 7.5.3. Baseline scenario 93. The activity participants shall establish and describe the baseline scenario for the CP in  accordance with the modalities in the generic CP as per paragraph 50 above. 94. The activity participants shall provide information on the facilities, systems and equipment  to be operated under the CP and in the baseline scenario. 95. When establishing the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee that future  emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to the specific  circumstances of the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed demand in  the applied methodology if such option is envisaged in the generic CP in accordance with  paragraph 51 above. 96. In case of replacement of existing equipment, the activity participants shall estimate the  point in time when the existing equipment would be replaced in the absence of the CP in  accordance with the guidance on determining the remaining lifetime of equipment in the  applied methodology if applicable. 97. If the CP is registered under or covered by another international, regional, national,  subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the activity participants shall  apply the most conservative baseline scenario between that which is required by the  applied methodology and that which is set under such other crediting scheme in  accordance with guidance to be provided by the Supervisory Body. 98. Notwithstanding paragraphs 93−97 above, if the CP applies an approved standardized  baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the activity participants shall describe  the baseline scenario as per the applied standardized baseline. 7.5.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 99. The activity participants shall describe the BAU scenario or reference benchmark  emissions for the proposed CP in accordance with the modalities of the generic CP-DD. 7.5.5.

Addressing non-permanence for component projects involving removals and  emission reduction component projects with reversal risks 101. For CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the activity  participants shall, as per the modalities for inclusion of a CP in the A6.4 PoA, identify and  assess the risks of reversals in the CP-DD, aligned with the provisions of the removals  26 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents approved by the  Supervisory Body, and conduct the risk assessment in accordance with the applied  methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 102. The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to:  (a) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity costs;  (b) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,  acts of terrorism, crime and war;  (c) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and geological  faults and fractures;  (d) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. 103. The risk assessment shall include:  (a) A risk mitigation plan using the reversal risk assessment tool to be developed by  the Supervisory Body to identify, assess and mitigate reversal risks; and  (b) The calculation of an overall percentage-based risk rating (hereinafter referred to  as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals, taking  into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood and duration of the risks. 104. The risk assessment shall be reviewed and revised by activity participants every five years  from the start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances referred to in  paragraph 115 below. 7.5.7. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals 105. The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex post calculation of  baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by the CP, and provide the ex-ante  calculation of them for each year of the crediting period, in accordance with the modalities  in the generic CP as per paragraphs 54–58 above. If the CP contains more than one  component, the activity participants shall apply this requirement for each component  separately. 106. The activity participants shall calculate, as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-  DD, the difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the  crediting period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward  adjustment based on BAU. 107. The activity participants shall determine whether the baseline must be adjusted  downwards as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD. 108. If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied  methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide  different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify  their choice in accordance with the modalities in the generic CP as per paragraph 59  above.  27 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 109. Activity participants shall identify the potential leakage sources, justify the exclusion of any  source and identify how these sources are avoided or minimized as per the modalities  contained in the generic CP-DD. 110. The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the CP is in accordance with the  generic CP as described as per paragraph 62 above. 7.5.8. Monitoring plan 111. The activity participants shall develop and describe a monitoring plan for the CP in  accordance with the modalities in the generic CP as described as per paragraphs 64−69  above. 112. For CPs involving removals, activity participants shall carry out the monitoring of removals  based on data derived from measurements, sampling, remote-sensing, third party sources  and published literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and  take appropriate account of the associated uncertainties as per the modalities contained  in the generic CP-DD. 113. The activity participants may choose to make a delayed submission of the monitoring plan,  that is after the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA and at any time prior to the  submission of the request for issuance of A6.4 ERs that covers the first monitoring period  of the CP. 114. If the activity participants choose to make a delayed submission of the monitoring plan in  accordance with paragraph 113 above, they shall clearly state in the CP-DD that the  submission of the monitoring plan is delayed and therefore the CP-DD submitted for  inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA does not contain information related to the  monitoring plan. 115. For CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan of CPs included in a registered A6.4 PoA  shall be reviewed and updated during the crediting period and verified by a DOE if:  (a) The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan  of a particular CP/(s) based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan  and the risk assessment plan;  (b) Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are  not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan of  a particular CP/(s);  (c) The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk  factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring  plan and the risk assessment plan of a particular CP/(s). 7.6. Start date, crediting period type and duration 116. The activity participants shall determine the start date of the CP as the date on which the  activity participants commit to making expenditures for the construction or modification of  the main equipment or facility (e.g. a wind turbine), or for the provision or modification of  a service (e.g. distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, change of transport management  system) under the CP. Where a contract is signed for such expenditures (e.g. for  28 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  procurement of a wind turbine), the start date is the date on which the contract is signed.  In other cases, it is the date on which such expenditures are incurred. If the CP involves  more than one of such contracts or incurred expenditures, the start date is the earliest of  the respective dates. Activities incurring minor pre-project expenses (e.g. feasibility  studies, preliminary surveys) are not considered in the determination of the start date. 117. The start date of the proposed CP shall be both (i) on or after 1 January 2021, and (ii) on  or after the start date of the PoA period as determined in accordance with paragraph 27  above. 118. The activity participants shall specify the reference to the notification to the secretariat of  the intention for the CP to be included in a registered A6.4 PoA submitted in accordance  with the activity cycle procedure. 119. The activity participants shall specify the expected operational lifetime of the CP and adjust  the crediting period(s) accordingly in cases where the DNA has specified conditions that  ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) is shorter than the lifetime of the  technology implemented, including any replacements undertaken during the crediting  period. 120. The activity participants shall specify in the CP-DD the crediting period type (renewable or  fixed), start date and duration of the crediting period of the CP consistent with the  indication made in the generic CP as per paragraph 70 above. In this context, the start  date of the crediting period of the CP shall be on or after the date of inclusion of the CP in  the registered A6.4 PoA. 121. The activity participants shall state the start date of the crediting period of the CP in the  format dd/mm/yyyy and shall not attach any qualifications to the start date, such as  “expected”. 122. A CP that has been included in a registered A6.4 PoA may not be re-included in the same  or different registered A6.4 PoA, or registered as an A6.4 project, after the expiry of its  final crediting period. 123. The crediting period of a CP shall not exceed the end of the duration of the PoA, regardless  of the crediting period type (renewable or fixed) of the CP. 124. The start date of the crediting period of a CP may be as early as 1 January 2021, but no  later than two years from the date of the notification of inclusion or from the date of  inclusion of the CP in a registered PoA in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 7.7. Environmental, social and sustainable development impacts 125. The activity participants shall carry out an assessment of the environmental, social and  sustainable development impacts of the CP, and provide in the CP-DD a summary of the  assessment and monitoring plan of such impacts and planned remedial measures of  negative impacts, if any, during the implementation and operation of the CP in accordance  with the A6.4 SD Tool reflecting the generic CP requirements in this regard referred to in  paragraph 72(m) above, and the filled-in forms required by the A6.4 SD Tool as follows:  (a) Provide the identification, evaluation and avoidance of environmental and/or social  risks that may be caused by a proposed A6.4 activity in the A6.4 Environmental  and social safeguards risk assessment form;  29 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (b) Provide the relevant mitigation and minimization measures and monitoring to be  implemented in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form if there  is any risk identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form;  (c) Provide the evaluation of sustainable development impacts and the measuring,  monitoring and reporting methodology in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form. 126. In addition, if an environmental impact assessment and/or social impact assessment were  carried out for the CP as required by and in accordance with the relevant procedures of  the host Party, the activity participants shall provide all conclusions of such assessments  and references to all related documentation reflecting the CP generic requirements in this  regard referred to in paragraph 72(m) above. 127. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by activity participants or by the DOE  during the validation for inclusion process, that exceed the environmental and social  safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation,  activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE and shall revise the  respective A6.4 SD Tool forms accordingly. 7.8. Integrity safeguards 128. The CP, in its development, implementation and operation shall not involve any illegal  activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery and criminal activities.  For this purpose, the activity participants shall prepare a declaration and submit it to the  DOE for its validation as part of the documentation for the inclusion of the CP in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 7.9. Local stakeholder consultation 129. The activity participants shall conduct a local, and where appropriate, subnational  stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively referred to as local stakeholder  consultation) on the CP in accordance with applicable host Party rules but also in line with  the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional elements for consultation  required by the A6.4 SD Tool, at minimum, reflecting the generic CP specific requirements  in this regard referred to in paragraph 72(l) above. In this context:  (a) If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional  elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool require more than those  required by the host Party rules, the activity participants shall follow the former by  additionally conducting the “gap” of the two;  (b) If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional  elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool are not compatible with the  relevant host Party rules and where it is not possible to follow the requirement in  subparagraph (a) above, the activity participants shall describe the modalities  chosen and justify the choice. 7.10. Eligibility for inclusion 130. The activity participants shall demonstrate how the CP meets the eligibility criteria for  inclusion as defined in the generic CP in accordance with section 6.12.11 above.  30 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 8.

Post-registration changes 8.3.1. General requirements 134. If there is any change regarding the modalities or information in the MoC statement  referred to in paragraph 35 above after the request for registration of the A6.4 PoA has  been submitted, the activity participants shall revise the MoC statement and obtain  approval of the change from the secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle  procedure. 135. The activity participants shall identify any proposed or actual changes to the  implementation, operation or monitoring of the registered A6.4 PoA or any included CP. 136. The activity participants shall determine whether the proposed or actual changes are  temporary deviations referred to in section 8.3.2 below, or permanent changes referred to  in section 8.3.3 below. 137. For temporary deviations, the activity participants are not required to prepare a revised  PoA-DD or CP-DD but shall describe the actual changes in the monitoring report. For  permanent changes, the activity participants shall prepare a revised PoA-DD or CP-DD,  the revised A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the revised  A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the revised A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form (in both track-change and clean versions) that reflects the  proposed or actual changes, using the valid version of the applicable PoA-DD or CP-DD  forms. The activity participants shall provide a summary of the changes, including the  reasons for the changes and any additional information relating to the changes to the PoA-  DD or CP-DD.  31 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 8.3.2. Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms  (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form, and the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 138. If the activity participants are temporarily unable to monitor any included CP in accordance  with the monitoring plan in the CP-DD (hereinafter referred to as the registered monitoring  plan), the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines  or the other applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool, the  activity participants shall describe the nature, extent and duration of the non-conforming  monitoring period in the monitoring report, and:  (a) Propose alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-conforming monitoring  period. In this case, the activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions  or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of  the deviation; or  (b) Apply the following most conservative values approach when alternative  monitoring arrangements are not proposed:  (i) If the CP is to achieve GHG emission reductions, apply zero for baseline  GHG emissions for the entire non-conforming monitoring period; or  (ii) Apply the values assuming that the source of GHG emissions is operated at  the maximum capacity for the entire non-conforming monitoring period. In  the case of project GHG emissions related to the consumption of electricity,  add 10 per cent to account for transmission and distribution losses. 139. If the monitoring of environmental, social and sustainable development parameters results  in negative impacts that exceed the risks identified in the A6.4 activity in the A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form and the indicators defined in  the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and in the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form and cannot be remediated by conducting additional consultation  with stakeholders or by employing mitigation measures, the activity participants shall  describe in the monitoring report the reasons for the negative impact and the measures  that will be employed to prevent the negative impact in the future. 8.3.3. Permanent changes 8.3.3.1. Corrections 140. If the activity participants make any corrections to the information or parameters fixed at  registration of the A6.4 PoA or inclusion of a CP as described in the registered PoA-DD or  CP-DD, the activity participants shall document these corrections in a revised PoA-DD or  CP-DD.20 20 This provision does not allow the parameter values fixed ex ante at the time of the registration of the  A6.4 PoA or inclusion of a CP to be updated, as it is not regarded as a correction.  32 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 8.3.3.2. Changes to the start date of the crediting period of component project 141. The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA may request a change to the start date  of the crediting period of any included CP if no request for issuance involving that CP has  been submitted yet and if the host Party approves the change in accordance with the  activity cycle procedure. In this context:  (a) The new start date shall not be later than two years from the date of inclusion of  the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA;  (b) Delaying the start date by up to one year or bringing forward the start date shall  not require any review and change to the application of methodologies and  standardized baselines;  (c) Delaying the start date by more than one year shall require full review and possible  change to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized  baselines. 8.3.3.3. Inclusion of monitoring plan 142. The activity participants may submit the monitoring plan of a CP after its inclusion in a  registered PoA in accordance with paragraph 113 above. 8.3.3.4. Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool  forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the  A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4  Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of  monitoring from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 143. If the activity participants are unable to implement the registered monitoring plan for any  included CP, or the monitoring for any included CP would permanently deviate from the  applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants  shall describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed  alternative monitoring for the CP in a revised CP-DD. If the permanent change or deviation  is not in line with the description of how to develop the monitoring plan of each CP provided  in the PoA-DD, the activity participants shall revise the PoA-DD before revising the CP-  DD. 144. If the monitoring would permanently deviate from the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the activity participants shall  describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed  alternative monitoring for the project in the revised A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 145. If the monitoring plan and risk assessment plan need to be reviewed and updated as per  paragraph 115 above, the activity participants shall describe the changes to the monitoring  plan and risk assessment plan in a revised CP-DD. 146. The activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the  calculations in the proposed alternative monitoring to the extent required to ensure that  33 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of  the permanent change or deviation. 8.3.3.5. Changes to programme design 147. Where there are changes to the programme design of a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity  participants shall prepare a revised PoA-DD that describes the nature and extent of the  proposed or actual changes. 148. Changes to a registered A6.4 PoA may include:  (a) Changes to the programme boundary to expand the geographical coverage or to  include additional host Parties;  (b) The following revisions to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA:  (i) Revision to the eligibility criteria due to the revision or replacement of the  applied methodologies by the Supervisory Body;21  (ii) Addition or change of technologies/measures with or without addition or  change of applied methodologies in the registered PoA-DD as referred in  subparagraph (f) below.  (iii) Revision to the eligibility criteria pertaining to the demonstration of  additionality;  (c) Removal of applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines from the  registered PoA-DD;  (d) Changes to the capacity22 range specified in the registered PoA-DD;  (e) Any change of programme design;  (f) Adding new components or extending/adding technologies/measures, provided  that they comply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that the host Party would  approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs, that introduce:  (i) Complementary technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy  transfer to/from the technologies/measures specified in the originally  registered PoA-DD;23 or 21 As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to apply a revised version  of the methodology that is different from the version applied for the registration of the PoA. However, the  activity cycle procedure also specifies that no new CPs can be included in the PoA until a post-  registration change to the PoA to reflect the requirements of the new version of the methodology is  approved by the Supervisory Body. 22 Installed/rated capacity of technologies and/or measures that directly impacts emission reductions or net  removals. 23 Examples include:  (a) A landfill gas capture and electricity generation activity using three electricity generating units adds  an additional electricity generating unit without altering the quantity of landfill gas extracted (i.e. the  capacity of the landfill gas extraction system remained the same);  (b) Addition of a back-up electricity generating source to supply electricity during exigencies when the  project fails to meet the demand or is not available due to operational reasons.  34 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (ii) More advanced version of the same technologies as per the definition of “the  same technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above (e.g. improved performance in  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, efficiency, health, safety  and durability evidenced in reference to a relevant national or international  standard);24  (g) Removing a component or technology/measure specified in the registered PoA-  DD;  (h) Changing the technologies/measures that result in the same  technologies/measures as the technologies/measures in the originally registered  PDD as per the definition of “the same technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above;25  (i) Any consequential changes to the application of methodologies, standardized  baselines and/or other methodological regulatory documents resulting from the  changes referred to in subparagraphs (a)−(h) above, including changes to or  addition of other methodologies, other standardized baselines and/or other  methodological regulatory documents, or application of a baseline scenario that is  more appropriate as a result of the modifications to the PoA;  (j) Voluntarily updating the applied methodologies or the other applied methodological  regulatory documents to a later valid version of them, or voluntarily changing to  other methodologies, provided all requirements in the updated/changed  methodologies and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are  met;  (k) Revision of generic CP to:  (i) Apply an applicable and valid standardized baseline to determine baseline  emissions or parameter values;  (ii) Switch from an ex post to an ex ante determination of parameter values for  calculating baseline emissions using a standardized baseline, subject to the  provisions and conditions set out in paragraph 186 below. 149. If the change to a registered A6.4 PoA is to include an additional host Party as referred to  in paragraph 148(a) above, the new host Party shall approve the PoA as per the  requirements in the activity cycle procedure. 150. For any post-registration changes to the PoA that may result in an increase in the  maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to  be achieved that was previously approved by the host Party, an approval of the post-  registration changes by the respective host Party is required as per the requirements of  the activity cycle procedure. 151. For the cases of revisions of the eligibility criteria that are not referred to in paragraph  148(b) above, the activity participants shall seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on  the appropriateness of the revision in accordance with the “Procedure: Consideration of  unsolicited letters to the Supervisory Body”. 24 Examples include a project disseminating lamps with a useful life of two years changing to distribute  lamps with a useful life of seven years. 25 Examples include changing the mode of utilization of recovered methane from a landfill, such as shifting  from flaring to heat generation or from heat generation to electricity generation.  35 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 152.

If the proposed or actual changes affect the additionality of the included CP as referred to  in paragraph 157(e) above, the demonstration of the impacts of the changes on the  additionality shall be based on the original input data for all elements other than those  affected by the changes.29 159. If the proposed or actual changes referred to in paragraph 155 above affect the  identification, assessment or monitoring of environmental, social or sustainable  development impacts, the activity participants shall reassess, based on paragraph 157(f)  above, the impact caused by the changes by providing a revised version of the A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form (if applicable) and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form. These revised forms shall be subject to validation by a DOE prior to or as part of the  first verification of emission reductions or net removals. 160. Where the activity participants cannot demonstrate compliance with the requirements of  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents with which the CP has been included, the activity  participants shall firstly undergo post-registration change to the registered A6.4 PoA in  accordance with paragraph 154 above, then:  (a) Revise the CP-DD, applying the methodologies, standardized baselines and the  other methodological regulatory documents in accordance with the generic CP in  the revised PoA-DD;  (b) Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the newly applied  methodologies, the newly applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents in the revised CP-DD. 8.3.4.

Change of activity participants 162. If any of the activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA change after the registration of  the PoA, the activity participants shall revise the PoA-DD to reflect the change and obtain  an authorization of the new activity participant from any of the host Parties of the PoA  through a dedicated interface in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. It is not  required to request approval from the Supervisory Body of the change. 8.4. Reversals-related actions for component projects involving removals and  emission reductions component projects with reversal risks 163. In case of occurrence of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that  could potentially lead to a reversal in CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA, activity  participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report in order to determine whether 29 If a proposed or actual modification adversely impacts the additionality of the CP, subsequent requests  for issuance of A6.4ERs based on such modifications will be rejected.  38 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  the observed event has resulted in an actual reversal.

For a CP with  phased implementation, the activity participants shall indicate the progress of the  CP achieved in each phase. 181. The activity participants shall indicate whether there are any temporary deviations from  the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents in accordance with  section 8.3.2 above, or permanent changes to the registered A6.4 PoA or included CPs,  or the registered monitoring plans in accordance with section 8.3.3 above (hereinafter  referred to as post-registration changes). For post-registration changes that have been  approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall indicate the dates of  approval. 9.5. Description of monitoring system 182. The activity participants shall describe the monitoring system and provide diagrams (e.g.  graphical schemes) showing all relevant monitoring points. This description may include  data collection procedures (e.g. information flow including data generation, aggregation,  recording, calculations and reporting), organizational structure, roles and responsibilities  of personnel, and emergency procedures for the monitoring system. 9.6. Data and parameters 183. The activity participants shall provide all parameters used to calculate the baseline, project  and leakage GHG emissions, or the baseline and actual net GHG removals, as well as  other relevant parameters of the included CPs for the monitoring period as required by the  registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. The activity  participants shall provide information on how data and parameters have been monitored. 184. For each parameter, the activity participants shall:  (a) Provide the values of the monitored parameter for the purpose of calculating GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals. Where data are measured  43 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  continuously, they shall be presented using an appropriate time interval. For a  default value that is not fixed at the time of the registration of the A6.4 PoA or the  inclusion of the CPs, the most recent value shall be applied;  (b) Describe the equipment used to monitor each parameter, including details on  accuracy class, and calibration information (i.e. frequency, date of calibration and  validity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan;  (c) Describe how the parameter is measured/calculated and the measurement and  recording frequency;  (d) Provide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g. logbooks, daily records, surveys);  (e) Provide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant;  (f) Describe the QA/QC procedures applied, if applicable, as per the registered  monitoring plan;  (g) Provide information about appropriate emission factor, IPCC default value and any  other reference value. 185. If data and parameters monitored are determined by a sampling approach, the activity  participants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance with the  sampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan. 186. For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a  choice between an ex ante and an ex post determination of parameter values for  calculating baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals for a generic CP and that chose  the ex ante determination, or that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring  a determination of these values ex ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline  valid at the time of the submission of the request for registration of the PoA for this purpose  to the generic CP, the activity participants shall apply the version of the standardized  baseline valid at the time of the inclusion of a corresponding CP for the purpose of  monitoring the CP until the end of the first crediting period of the CP. If no valid version of  the applied standardized baseline is available at the time of the inclusion of a  corresponding CP despite the fact that the corresponding generic CP applied the  standardized baseline, the activity participants shall calculate baseline GHG emissions or  net GHG removals, or parameter values in accordance with the applied methodology  and/or applicable methodological tool and apply them to the CP until the end of its first  crediting period of the CP. 187. For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a  choice between an ex ante and an ex post determination of parameter values for  calculating baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex post  determination where there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of  registration of the PoA, the activity participants may, at any time during the first PoA period,  switch to the ex ante determination by applying to the generic CP an applicable  standardized baseline that becomes available after the registration of the PoA and is valid  at the time of the switch. For all corresponding CPs that have been included before the  switch, the activity participants shall switch to the ex ante determination by applying the  standardized baseline as per the revised generic CP. After the switch, for all new  corresponding CPs, the activity participants shall apply the version of the standardized  baseline valid at the time of their inclusion or, if no valid version of the standardized  baseline is available at the time of their inclusion, the activity participants shall calculate  44 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  these values in accordance with the applied methodology and/or applicable  methodological tool for the CPs. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline  shall undergo the post-registration change approval process for the PoA, and the switch  of all included CPs to the ex ante determination shall undergo post-registration change  notification process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 188. For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a  choice between an ex ante and ex post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals to generic CPs, the activity participants  shall, at each renewal of the PoA period, choose the ex ante or ex post determination of  parameter values for each generic CP individually, unless otherwise required by the  applied methodology or methodological tool, and shall follow the same rules in terms of  the use and validity of standardized baselines as in paragraphs 186 and 187 above. 189. Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form, if applicable, and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form containing all  parameters used to monitor the environmental and social impacts and the sustainable  development impacts for each CP included in the batch of requests for issuance and  explaining how any negative environmental and social impacts have been assessed,  mitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in the registered CP-DD. 190. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the  DOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements  and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants  may request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4  SD Tool forms accordingly. 191. For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the  monitoring report for each CP included in the batch of requests for issuance as part of the  investment analysis. 9.7. Calculation of emission reductions or net removals 192. The activity participants shall, for each of the included CPs for the monitoring period,  identify the formulae used for the calculations of, and provide calculation results of, the  following:  (a) Baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals;  (b) Project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals;  (c) Leakage GHG emissions;  (d) GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals . 193. Where the batch/group of CPs includes CPs involving removals that also result in emission  reductions, the accounting of removals and emission reductions shall be separated for  each CP in the monitoring report in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the  activity. 194. The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by the included CPs with the estimates in the registered CP-  DDs. The activity participants shall ensure that the sum of the amount of GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals requested for issuance and the cumulative amount of  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals already issued for the PoA are up to the  45 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by  the host Party; otherwise a post-registration change to the PoA shall be approved by the  host Party and the Supervisory Body as per the respective requirements of the activity  cycle procedure, prior to requesting issuance. 195. For any included CP, the activity participants shall explain the cause of any increase in  the actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the monitoring  period (e.g. higher water availability, higher plant load factor), including all information (i.e.  data and/or parameters) that is different from what is stated in the CP-DD. 10. Renewal of programme of activities and component  projects 10.1. Renewal of programme of activities period 196. The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA shall renew the PoA period every five  years (every 15 years for the registered PoAs involving removals) counting from the start  date of the first PoA period as determined in accordance with paragraph 27 above. 197. The PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA may be renewed if the host Party has approved  the renewal when approving the PoA prior to its registration in accordance with the activity  cycle procedure. 198. To support a request for renewal of the PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity  participants shall, using the valid version of the applicable PoA-DD form, update the  relevant sections of the PoA-DD of the PoA including the eligibility criteria for inclusion of  CPs in the PoA and for demonstrating additionality, and modalities for setting the baseline  and for preparing the monitoring plan and the new PoA period. 199. When updating the PoA-DD and its generic components, activity participants shall apply  methodologies in one of the following manners:  (a) The activity participants shall use the valid version of the methodologies and  methodological tools applied in the registered PoA-DD; that is, the latest version at  the time of the submission of the request for renewal of the PoA period or the  previous version if the submission of the request is still within the grace period of  the previous version for use;30  (b) If any of the methodologies applied in the registered PoA-DD was withdrawn after  the registration of the PoA and was replaced by consolidated methodologies, the  activity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies;  or  (c) If the PoA does not meet the applicability conditions of the methodologies or  methodological tools under the options in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above due to  their revisions or due to the update of the baseline, the activity participants shall  either:  (i) Select other applicable approved methodologies; or 30 Referredto in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools”.  46 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (ii) Request, under the clarification process in the “Procedure: Development,  revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”, either  through the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the PoA period or by  themselves, to clarify whether a deviation from the valid version of the  methodologies (including consolidated methodologies thereof) or the  methodological tools applied in the registered PoA-DD, or from any other  selected methodologies or any other methodological tools applied in  accordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable. 200. In updating the PoA-DD of the registered A6.4 PoA in accordance with paragraphs 198  and 199 above, the activity participants shall consider the application of an approved  standardized baseline to the PoA as follows:  (a) The activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved standardized  baseline if:  (i) The standardized baseline is applied in the registered PoA-DD and the valid  version of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the PoA and to the  methodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 198 above; or  (ii) The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PoA-DD but the  valid version of the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory31 is  applicable to the PoA and to the methodologies applied in accordance with  paragraph 198 above. However, the activity participants may update the  PoA-DD without selecting such standardized baseline if the submission of  the request for renewal of the PoA period is made within 240 days after the  standardized baseline became valid;  (b) If the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PoA-DD  is no longer applicable to the PoA and/or to the valid version of the methodologies  applied in the registered PoA-DD due to a revision of the standardized baseline  after the registration of the PoA, the activity participants shall:  (i) Select another applicable approved standardized baseline; or  (ii) Use only the valid version of the methodologies applied in the registered  PoA-DD that are still applicable to the PoA and that can be used  independently for estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  without using the standardized baseline applied in the registered PoA-DD;  (c) The activity participants may use the valid version of an applicable approved  standardized baseline if:  (i) The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PoA-DD;  (ii) The standardized baseline does not require its mandatory selection but is  applicable to the PoA and to the methodologies applied in accordance with  paragraph 198 above. 201. The activity participants shall demonstrate that the modalities for setting the baseline or  updating it for each of the corresponding CPs is in accordance with paragraphs 202−203  below. 31 For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 19.  47 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 202. When defining the modalities for setting the baseline or updating it, the activity participants  shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies, standardized  baselines, and other methodological regulatory documents. 203. If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline were determined ex ante  and not monitored during the PoA period and are no longer valid, the activity participants  shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be provided  by the Supervisory Body. 204. The result of the process described in paragraphs 198–203 above defines a new version  of the PoA-DD, including its generic CP-DD part. 205. The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up-to-date. 206. If the activity participants plan to make, or have made, a post-registration change to the  programme design effective from the start date of the new PoA period, they shall clearly  indicate the post-registration change in the new version of the PoA-DD, distinguishing the  post-registration change from other updates of information due to renewal of the PoA  period. 10.2. Renewal of crediting period of component projects 207. To renew the crediting period of an included CP, the activity participants shall, using the  valid version of the applicable CP-DD form, update the sections of the CP-DD in  accordance with the latest version of the applicable generic component of the PoA-DD,  relating to:  (a) The baseline emissions, including updating the downward adjustment as per  paragraphs 56 and 57 above;  (b) The BAU scenario and emissions, and the difference between the baseline  emissions and BAU emissions as annual and total amounts with respect to the  crediting period to be renewed;  (c) The estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable);  (d) The monitoring plan (if applicable);  (e) The A6.4 SD Tool forms;  (f) The risk assessment and monitoring plan for CPs involving removals and for  emission reduction CPs with reversal risks;  (g) The crediting period. 208. To demonstrate the validity of the CP’s original baseline or its update, the activity  participants shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies,  standardized baselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents as per  the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD. 209. If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline, which were determined  ex ante and were not monitored during the crediting period, are no longer valid, the activity  participants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be  provided by the Supervisory Body.  48 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 11. Post-crediting monitoring and reporting 210. For all CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, activity  participants shall continue monitoring the CPs after the end of the last active crediting  period to:  (a) Assess whether any reversals have occurred;  (b) Quantify the amount of reversals; and  (c) Confirm the continued storage of the GHGs. 211. Activity participants may terminate the post-crediting monitoring of CPs included in a  registered A6.4 PoA, subject to approval by the Supervisory Body, if they can  demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable information, that:  (a) The stored GHGs in the CPs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or  (b) The potential future reversals for CPs are remediated in accordance with the  provisions of the relevant section of the removals standard (i.e., Remediation of  reversals). 12. Voluntary exclusion and re-inclusion of component  projects 12.1. Voluntary exclusion of component projects 212. At any time after the inclusion of a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity participants  may request the secretariat to exclude the CP from the PoA in accordance with the activity  cycle procedure. 213. A CP that has been voluntarily excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA or excluded due to  erroneous inclusion may be re-included in the same or different registered A6.4 PoA in  accordance with section 12.2 below or registered as an A6.4 project in accordance with  the relevant provisions in the \"Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”. 12.2. Re-inclusion of excluded component projects 214. The activity participants wishing to re-include an excluded CP in a registered A6.4 PoA  shall follow the process for inclusion of CPs in a registered A6.4 PoA in accordance with  the activity cycle procedure after ensuring that:  (a) The CP-DD transparently declares that the CP has been previously excluded from  the same or different registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to erroneous  inclusion;  (b) The crediting period type (i.e. renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting  period are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of  the exclusion, noting that A6.4ERs may be claimed for the period only from or after  the date of re-inclusion, and:  (i) If the crediting period type is renewable, the updated CP-DD shall be  uploaded by the validating DOE within one year of the end date of the  49 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  crediting period valid for the CP at the time of the exclusion, noting that  missing the deadline no longer allows the uploading of the updated CP-DD;  (ii) If the crediting period type is fixed, the updated CP-DD shall be uploaded by  the validating DOE prior to the end date of the crediting period valid for the  CP at the time of the exclusion, noting that missing the deadline no longer  allows the uploading of the updated CP-DD;  (c) If the crediting period type is renewable and the re-inclusion takes place after the  end of the crediting period in which the exclusion occurred, the CP complies with  the generic CP, including the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA, and  relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements;  (d) If the CP applies a methodology that potentially accrues negative GHG emission  reductions, GHG emission reductions have been continuously monitored in  accordance with the registered monitoring plan and verified by a DOE since the  end of the monitoring period in the last published monitoring report for the CP,  including the exclusion period. For such CP, if there were net negative GHG  emission reductions during the period before the re-inclusion, the amount shall be  deducted from the first requests for issuance of A6.4 ERs covering that CP after  the re-inclusion;  (e) If the CP has been excluded as a result of erroneous inclusion and to be re-  included in the same PoA, the non-compliance with the requirements for inclusion  in the PoA that led to the erroneous inclusion has been rectified, and, if A6.4 ERs  have been issued for the CP, an equivalent amount of A6.4ERs have been  compensated by the DOE that included the CP, to the mechanism registry in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure.  50 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 Appendix 1.

Modalities of local stakeholder consultation 1. Scope and target of consultation 1. The scope of the local or subnational stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively  referred to as local stakeholder consultation) shall comprise, as a minimum, the potential  direct positive and negative impacts that the proposed component projects (CPs) that may  be included in a registered programme of activities under the mechanism established by  Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (A6.4 PoA) may have. 2. The local stakeholder consultation of proposed CPs shall be conducted for each CP. If  more than one CP is located in the same or close geographical location(s), one local  stakeholder consultation may cover multiple CPs. In this case, the activity participants  shall provide appropriate justification. 3. The activity participants shall invite, as a minimum, representatives of local stakeholders  directly impacted by the proposed CP, including local communities and Indigenous  Peoples, as applicable, and representatives of local authorities relevant to the CP. 4. The activity participants shall provide evidence that invitations were sent to the relevant  stakeholders and that their comments were invited. If any of the relevant stakeholders  were not invited, the activity participants shall provide appropriate justification. 2. Timing of consultation 5. The activity participants shall complete the local stakeholder consultation process at the  timing required by the rules of the host Party on local stakeholder consultation, if such  rules exist. If such host Party rules do not exist, the activity participants shall complete the  process before, whichever the earlier of:  (a) The start date of the CP as defined in paragraphs 116−117 of the main part of this  standard; or  (b) The date of submitting the component project design document (CP-DD) of the  proposed CP to a designated operational entity (DOE) for validation. 6. For CPs that do not meet the requirement referred to in paragraph 5 above, the activity  participants may submit a request for exemption from the requirement to the Supervisory  Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism for its consideration on a case-by-case basis. 3. Conduct of consultation 7. The activity participants shall invite local stakeholders to provide comments on the  proposed CP in an open and transparent manner, in a way that facilitates comments to be  received from local stakeholders and allows for a reasonable time for comments to be  submitted. The activity participants shall describe the steps/actions taken to invite  comments, taking into account local and national circumstances. 8. The activity participants shall convey information to stakeholders about the local  stakeholder consultation and the proposed CP in ways that are appropriate for the  52 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  community that is directly affected by the project. In areas where a significant part of the  population is illiterate, the information shall be provided orally. 9. The activity participants shall describe the proposed CP(s) in a manner that allows local  stakeholders to understand the project. The information to be made available to local  stakeholders shall include, inter alia:  (a) A summary of the proposed CP, explaining the project in simple, non-technical  terms, and containing a description of the direct positive and negative impacts;  (b) Information on the projected scope, lifetime and direct positive and negative  impacts of the proposed CP;  (c) A summary of the analysis of the environmental and social impacts and sustainable  development benefits of the proposed CP and the three completed A6.4 SD Tool  forms;  (d) Other relevant information about the proposed CP, taking into account  confidentiality provisions referred to in paragraph 9(e) of the main part of this  standard;  (e) The means to provide comments about the proposed CP. 10. The activity participants shall conduct the local stakeholder consultation through means  that are appropriate for the local and national circumstances. 11. The activity participants shall provide local stakeholders with the opportunity to comment,  in writing or via other means and gather their comments about the proposed CP and its  direct impacts. 12. The activity participants shall request the designated national authority (DNA) of the host  Party to forward any comments from local stakeholders submitted to the host Party to  them. 13. The activity participants shall prepare a summary report of the comments received from  local stakeholders. 14. The activity participants shall consider the comments provided by local stakeholders and  report in the CP-DD on how they have taken them into account. The activity participants  shall provide justification if any comments were not incorporated. 4. Activities after consultation 15. After the completion of the local stakeholder consultation, local stakeholders may submit  a complaint to the DNA of the host Party if they find that the outcome of the local  stakeholder consultation is not appropriately taken into account. The DOE shall request  the DNA to forward such complaints, if any, to the DOE and promptly forward them to the  activity participants during the validation in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and  verification standard for programmes of activities”. 16. If, during the validation of the proposed CP, complaints submitted to the DNA of the host  Party on the handling of the outcome of the local stakeholder consultation are forwarded  to the activity participants through the DOE, the activity participants shall take due account  53 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  of such complaints and modify the CP-DD as appropriate before the DOE concludes the  validation.  54 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 Appendix 3. Instructions for the consideration of cross  effects for the application of multiple  methodologies for programme of activities 215. These instructions are applicable to a programme of activity (PoA) seeking to apply  multiple technologies/measures under the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph  4, of the Paris Agreement. 216. Cross-effects may occur when multiple technologies/measures are implemented, applying  either one methodology or multiple methodologies. 217. If a single methodology is consistently applied in each component project (CP) in a PoA  but using multiple technologies/measures, it may potentially lead to over-estimation of  greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions when several technologies/measures interact  with each other. The cross-effects in such situations shall be addressed through additional  guidance related to the application of the methodology for a PoA contained in the applied  methodology. 218. The activity participants shall consider the following situations to identify cross-effects.  These situations are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive and are intended to serve  as examples only:  (a) Type I: Cross-effects could occur when there is an exchange of energy (thermal,  mechanical or electrical) or mass transfer between different measures within a CP  or between CPs, where the transfer occurs from a primary or independent measure  to a dependent measure;  (b) Type II: Cross-effects could occur when several measures rely on the same  information when estimating GHG emission reductions. For example, several  measures refer to historical fuel/electricity/heat consumption or a default value. 219. The activity participants shall consider that, when combining different types of measures,  (e.g. energy efficiency and fuel switch), the baselines for different measures shall be  determined sequentially and not simultaneously. The baseline of the second  technology/measure shall be set after considering the effects of the implementation of the  first technology/measure:  (a) For Type I cross-effects, the energy/mass stream of the dependent measure shall  be determined conservatively, taking into account the output of the primary  measure;  (b) For Type II cross-effects, once a baseline is estimated/determined, the secondary  (tertiary, etc.) measure shall not use the historical/default values, but an adjusted  value taking into account a scenario in which the primary measure is implemented.  -----  55 of 56  A6.4-STAN-AC-004 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  Document information  Version Date Description  02.0 16 May 2025 SBM 016, Annex 7.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The Supervisory Body, at its thirteenth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 validation and  verification standard for programmes of activities” (hereinafter referred to as this standard)  that sets out the requirements relating to validation and verification for Article 6.4  mechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and component projects (CPs). 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of  Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”4 (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies  standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article  6.4 mechanism”5 (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article  6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two  standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas  the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have  met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental  risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to  sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of  the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). 1.2. Objectives 5. The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to validation and  verification for Article 6.4 mechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and  component projects (CPs) that may be included in registered A6.4 PoAs. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Information is reliable if the quality of evidence is accurate, credible  and able to yield the same results on a repeated basis.  10 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 5.3. Use of applicable forms 18. The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants completed the valid version of  the relevant forms by following the instructions therein. 19. The DOE contracted to conduct validation for registration of a proposed A6.4 PoA, post-  registration changes or renewal of the PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA, as well as  validation for the equivalent processes for CPs, shall prepare a validation report using the  valid version of the relevant validation report form9 and following the instructions therein. 20. The DOE contracted to conduct verification and certification of the implementation of the  registered A6.4 PoAs and monitored GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals shall  prepare a verification and certification report using the valid version of the relevant  verification and certification report form10 and following the instructions therein. 5.4. Use of applicable global warming potentials 21. The DOE shall determine whether the global warming potentials (GWPs) were correctly  applied in the programme of activities design document (PoA-DD), the component project  design document (CP-DD) and in the monitoring report in accordance with relevant  requirements in the activity standard. 6. Validation for registration of programmes of activities 6.1. General requirements 6.1.1. Overarching requirement 22. The DOE shall determine whether the proposed A6.4 PoA complies with all relevant  requirements in the activity standard for registration of the PoA under the Article 6.4  mechanism. 6.1.2. Standard auditing techniques 23. The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. 24. In assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of validation specified  throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including,  but not limited to:  (a) Document review, involving:  (i) A review of data and information;  (ii) Cross-checks between the information provided in the PoA-DD and  information from sources other than those used to determine whether the  information in the PoA-DD is reliable; if available, the DOE’s sectoral or local  expertise; and, if necessary, independent background investigations; 9 All types of validation report forms are available on the UNFCCC website. 10 All types of verification and certification report forms are available on the UNFCCC website.  11 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (b) Follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection and telephone or e-mail interviews),  including:  (i) Interviews with relevant stakeholders in the host country, such as personnel  with knowledge of the A6.4 PoA design and implementation;  (ii) Cross-checks between the information provided by interviewed personnel  (i.e. by checking sources or other interviews) to ensure that no relevant  information has been omitted;  (c) Reference to available information relating to programmes, projects or  technologies similar to the proposed A6.4 PoA or CP under validation;  (d) Review, based on the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, of the  appropriateness of formulae and accuracy of calculations;  (e) Sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for  A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 25. It is optional for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection for validation for the registration  of a proposed A6.4 PoA. If the DOE conducts an on-site inspection, it does not necessarily  need to include a visit to the geographical locations where CPs will be or are being  implemented, but the inspection could be to the office of the representative activity  participants. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site inspection as a means of validation,  it shall describe the alternative means used and justify that they are sufficient for the  purpose of validation. 26. Where no specific means of validation are specified, the DOE shall apply the standard  auditing techniques described in paragraph 24 above. 6.1.3. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests 27. If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order  to determine whether the proposed A6.4 PoA meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism  rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues are accurately identified,  formulated, discussed and concluded in the validation report. 28. The DOE shall raise a corrective action request (CAR) if one or more of the following  situations occurs:  (a) Mistakes have been made by the activity participants that will influence the ability  of the proposed A6.4 PoA to achieve real, measurable, verifiable and additional  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (b) The applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have not been met;  or  (c) There is a risk that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals cannot be  monitored or calculated. 29. The DOE shall raise a clarification request (CL) if the information provided by the activity  participants is insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article  6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have been met.  12 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 30. The DOE shall raise a forward action request (FAR) if issues related to programme  implementation that require review during the first verification after the validation of the  proposed A6.4 PoA are identified. The DOE shall not raise a FAR that relates to the Article  6.4 mechanism rules and requirements for registration of the PoA. 31. The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify  the PoA design and/or the PoA-DD, or provide additional explanations or evidence that  satisfy the DOE’s concerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for  registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA. 32. The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its validation report. This reporting  shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity participants, the  means of validation of such responses, and references to any resulting changes in the  PoA-DD or its supporting documents. 6.2.

The DOE shall:  (a) Describe the process undertaken to validate the accuracy and completeness of the  description of the generic CP(s);  (b) Provide an opinion on the accuracy and completeness of the description of the  generic CP(s). 6.3.2. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 6.3.2.1. General 70. The DOE shall determine whether selected methodologies, standardized baselines and  any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines, approved by  the Supervisory Body, that have been applied by the activity participants are valid,11  applicable to the generic CP and, if applicable, are in compliance with the methodological  requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)  of the RMPs. 71. The DOE shall determine whether the design of the generic CP complies with all the  requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological  requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)  of the RMPs. 72. The DOE or the activity participants may submit a proposed new methodology in  accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies  and methodological tools” if there is no available methodology that can be applied to the  proposed A6.4 PoA. 6.3.2.2. Deviation from or revision of methodologies and/or methodological tools 73. The DOE may seek clarification from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a  deviation from a selected approved methodology, methodological tool or any other applied  methodological regulatory document in accordance with the “Procedure: Development,  revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” prior to the 11 The valid version of a methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission of the  request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA to the secretariat, in accordance with the activity cycle  procedure, is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance with the  “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.  18 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  submission of a request for registration or publication of the PoA-DD for global stakeholder  consultation (GSC), if the DOE, when performing validation for the proposed A6.4 PoA, or  upon request from the activity participants before the publication of the PoA-DD for GSC,  finds that, due to a PoA-specific12 issue implying that a revision of the methodology and/or  methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the activity participants  deviated from:  (a) The selected methodology, methodological tool or any other applied  methodological regulatory document; or  (b) Sections in the selected methodology, methodological tool or any other applied  methodological regulatory document that are not standardized by the selected  standardized baselines, if the proposed generic CP applies standardized  baselines. 74. Alternatively, if the DOE considers that a revision of the selected methodology,  methodological tool or any other applied methodological regulatory document would be  required to address the programme situation, the DOE shall submit, or request the activity  participants to submit, a request for revision in accordance with the “Procedure:  Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”. 6.3.2.3. Clarification on applicability of methodologies and/or methodological tools  and/or standardized baseline 75. If the DOE cannot determine the applicability of a selected methodology, methodological  tool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed generic CP, the DOE shall request a  clarification on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision  and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and/or the “Procedure:  Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. The DOE shall  conduct an assessment to ensure that the request is not submitted with the intention of  revising the selected methodology, methodological tool and/or standardized baseline to  expand their applicability. 12 Examples of PoA-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following:  (a) The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a  certain method. The activity participants of the proposed PoA identify a difficulty in acquiring the  specified instrumentation or difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however, they can  achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative instrumentation or  measurement method;  (b) A proposed CP does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology for a certain  parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the CP to estimate the parameter with  equal reliability and accuracy;  (c) A minor deviation is sought for a PoA-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative. For  example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5% of rated  capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the plant has  never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated capacity  (20% below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying conservative approaches  to calculate the emission reduction in such a PoA-specific case;  (d) A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to  programme-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology. For example, a well-  justified conservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to  address uncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period.  19 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 6.3.3. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 6.3.3.1. General 76. The DOE shall validate that the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are applicable to  the design of the proposed generic CP and that the selected versions are valid at the time  of submission of the proposed A6.4 PoA for registration and, if applicable, are in  compliance with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party  in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 77. The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents were correctly  applied with respect to the following:  (a) Applicability conditions;  (b) Project boundary;  (c) Baseline identification;  (d) Algorithms and/or formulae used to determine emission reductions;  (e) Additionality;  (f) Monitoring methodology. 78. The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are correctly quoted  and applied by comparing them with the actual text of the valid version of these  documents, and relevant requirements in the activity standard. 79. If the generic CP applies a previous version of a methodology or a standardized baseline  but the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA is likely to be submitted after the  grace period for applying the previous version in accordance with the validity section of  the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools”, the DOE shall request the activity participants to provide a revised  PoA-DD, applying the latest version of the methodology or other applicable and valid  methodology, or the standardized baseline in accordance with the activity standard. 80. If the generic CP does not apply a standardized baseline but the request for registration  of the proposed A6.4 PoA is likely to be submitted after an applicable approved  standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory has become valid and after the grace  period for not applying the standardized baseline in accordance with the validity section of  the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized  baselines”, the DOE shall request the activity participants to provide a revised PoA-DD,  applying the standardized baseline in accordance with the activity standard. 81. The DOE shall determine whether the generic CP meets all the applicability conditions of  the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents. This shall be undertaken by validating the  documentation referred to in the PoA-DD and by verifying that the documentation content  is correctly quoted and interpreted in the PoA-DD. If the DOE, based on local and sectoral  knowledge, is aware that comparable information is available from credible sources other  than those used in the PoA-DD, then the DOE shall cross-check the PoA-DD against such  20 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  other sources to confirm that the generic CP meets the applicability conditions of the  selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents. 82. For each applicability condition listed in the selected methodologies, the selected  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the  DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the relevant information contained in the  PoA-DD against these criteria. The DOE shall state its opinion regarding the applicability  of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents to the proposed generic CP. 83. If the generic CP applies multiple methodologies, the DOE shall assess and state its  opinion on whether the methodologies were applied in accordance with the activity  standard. 6.3.3.2. Project boundary, sources and greenhouse gases 84. The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to define the project boundary of  each of the corresponding CPs, including which sources and GHGs are to be included in  the project boundary under which conditions or circumstances, is in accordance with the  applied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines. 85. The DOE shall confirm that the description of defining the project boundary is based on  documented evidence and, where conducted, an on-site inspection. 86. If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity  participants to choose whether a GHG source or gas is to be included within the project  boundary, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have justified that  choice. The DOE shall determine whether the justification provided is reasonable, based  on an assessment of supporting documented evidence provided by the activity  participants and corroborated by observations if required. 87. The DOE shall describe how the validation of the project boundary has been performed  by detailing the documentation assessed (e.g. a commissioning report) and, where  conducted, by describing its observations during any on-site inspection (i.e. observations  of the physical site or equipment used in the process). 88. The DOE shall state whether the description of how to define the project boundary of each  of the corresponding CPs and the selected GHG sources and gases are justified for the  generic CP. Should the DOE identify GHG emission sources that will be affected by the  implementation of corresponding CPs and which are expected to contribute more than 1  per cent of the overall expected average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals, and are not addressed by the applied methodologies or the applied  standardized baselines, the DOE shall request a clarification of, revision to, or clarification  for acceptance of deviation from the methodologies or the standardized baselines in  accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies  and methodological tools” or the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and  update of standardized baselines” as applicable. 6.3.3.3. Baseline scenario 89. The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to establish the baseline scenario  for each of the corresponding CPs is in accordance with the applied methodologies, an  approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, other applied  21 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  methodological regulatory documents and, where applicable, the baseline approaches  specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. The DOE  shall assess whether a more ambitious baseline requirement, as determined by the host  Party and approved by the Supervisory Body, has been applied in the identification of the  most plausible baseline scenario, if applicable. 90. The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to establish the baseline scenario  in the case where it is foreseen that the future anthropogenic emissions by sources are  projected to rise above current levels due to the specific circumstances of the host Party  complies with guidance on suppressed demand in the applied methodology. 91. The DOE shall describe whether the description of the identification of the baseline  scenario in the generic CP-DD is in accordance with the selected standardized baseline if  the generic CP uses an approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline  scenario. 92. If the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the  identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on financial  expertise and local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are  considered by the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those  required by the methodologies, are realistic and credible in the context of the generic CP  and that no alternative scenario has been excluded. 93. The DOE shall determine whether any procedure contained in the applied methodologies,  methodological tool or other methodological regulatory documents to identify the most  reasonable baseline scenario has been correctly applied. 94. The DOE shall determine whether the identification of the most plausible baseline scenario  is reasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the  generic CP-DD. It shall determine whether the documents and sources referred to in the  generic CP-DD are correctly quoted and interpreted. The DOE shall cross-check the  information provided in the generic CP-DD with other verifiable and credible sources, such  as local expert opinion, if available. 95. The DOE shall determine whether the generic CP-DD provides a description of the  technology that would be deployed and/or the activities that would take place in the  absence of each of the corresponding CPs. 96. The DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the requirements and state its opinion  on whether:  (a) All the assumptions and data used by the activity participants are listed in the  generic CP-DD, including their references and sources;  (b) All documentation used is relevant for establishing the baseline scenario and  correctly quoted and interpreted in the generic CP-DD;  (c) Assumptions and data used in the identification of the baseline scenario are  justified appropriately, supported by evidence, and can be deemed reasonable;  (d) Relevant national and/or sectoral policies, regulations and circumstances are  considered and listed in the generic CP-DD;  22 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (e) The applied methodologies have been correctly followed to describe the  identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, and the description  reasonably represents what would occur in the absence of corresponding CPs. 97. The DOE shall describe other steps taken and sources of information used to cross-check  the information contained in the generic CP-DD. 6.3.3.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 98. The DOE shall assess whether, in the generic CP-DD, the identification and the  description of the business-as-usual (hereinafter referred as BAU) scenario or reference  benchmark emissions comply with the requirements of the activity standard, applied  methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 6.3.3.5. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals 99. The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to undertake the ex ante and ex  post calculations of baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as  well as GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by each of the  corresponding CPs are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents and,  where applicable, the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be  developed by the Supervisory Body. 100. Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or  parameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided  (based on the choice of the baseline scenario, context of the proposed generic CP and  other evidence provided) and that the correct equations and parameters have been used,  in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 101. The DOE shall verify the justification given in the generic CP-DD for the choice of data  and parameters used in the equations, as follows:  (a) Data and parameters fixed ex ante: If data and parameters will not be monitored  throughout the crediting periods of corresponding CPs but will be determined prior  to their inclusion in the proposed A6.4 PoA individually for each CP and will remain  fixed throughout the crediting periods, the DOE shall determine whether the  identification of all data sources and assumptions are appropriate and applicable  to the generic CP, and will result in an accurate or otherwise conservative estimate  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals. If the applied methodologies  require that any of these data and parameters be determined in accordance with  the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the  Supervisory Body, the DOE shall determine whether the generic CP-DD states the  necessity of conducting such sampling in accordance with this standard;  (b) Data and parameters to be monitored: If data and parameters will be monitored  or estimated on implementation of corresponding CPs and hence become  available only after the inclusion of corresponding CPs, the DOE shall determine  whether the modalities for estimation of these data and parameters provided in the  generic CP-DD are reasonable. If the applied methodologies require that any of  these estimates be determined in accordance with the standard for sampling and  23 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body, the DOE shall  determine whether the generic CP-DD states the necessity of conducting such  sampling in accordance with this standard. 102. For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the DOE shall  assess whether the estimation of removals and emission reductions is separated and that  it was undertaken in accordance with the applied methodology(ies) applicable to the  generic CP. 103. The DOE shall determine whether, in the generic CP-DD, the steps taken to calculate the  difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the crediting  period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward adjustment  based on BAU are in compliance with relevant provisions of the activity standard, the  methodologies standard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological  regulatory documents. 104. The DOE shall assess whether the approach to determining whether the baseline shall be  adjusted downward, was applied in compliance with the requirements of the activity  standard, respective provisions of the methodologies standard, applied methodologies  and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 105. The DOE shall determine whether the approach to determine leakage emissions in the  generic CP-DD is in accordance with activity standard and relevant applied methodologies  and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 106. The DOE shall also assess whether the approaches for avoiding or minimizing and  accounting for leakage emissions are in line with the respective requirements of the activity  standard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 107. The DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the requirements and state its opinion  on whether:  (a) All assumptions and data used by the activity participants are listed in the generic  CP-DD, including their references and sources;  (b) All documentation used by the activity participants as the basis for assumptions  and sources of data are correctly quoted and interpreted in the generic CP-DD;  (c) All values used in the generic CP-DD, including GWPs, are considered reasonable  in the context of the generic CP;  (d) The methodologies, standardized baselines and other methodological regulatory  documents have been applied correctly to describe how to calculate baseline,  project and leakage GHG emissions as well as GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals for corresponding CPs;  (e) Modalities to estimate the baseline GHG emissions or GHG removals can be  replicated using the data and parameter values provided in the generic CP-DD;  (f) The necessity of conducting sampling in accordance with the standard for sampling  and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body is stated,  where the applied methodologies require that the data and parameters be  determined in accordance with this standard.  24 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 108. The DOE shall describe how it has verified the data and parameters used in the equations,  including references to any other data sources used. 6.3.3.6. Validation of the monitoring plan 109. The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to develop a monitoring plan for  each of the corresponding CPs complies with the requirements of the activity standard,  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied  methodological regulatory documents and, where applicable, the standard for sampling  and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 110.

Eligibility criteria for inclusion of component projects 113. The DOE shall assess whether the eligibility criteria for inclusion of corresponding CPs in  the proposed A6.4 PoA are defined in accordance with the activity standard. 114. The DOE shall assess how each eligibility criterion, including the conditions that  corresponding CPs meet the requirement pertaining to the demonstration of additionality,  is defined in accordance with the applicable requirements in the activity standard, and is  verifiable as well as sufficiently objective and comprehensive to permit the assessment of  the inclusion of corresponding CPs in the proposed A6.4 PoA. 6.4. Validation status, outcomes, opinion and report 6.4.1. Validation opinion 115.

Description of component project 132. The DOE shall describe the process undertaken to validate the accuracy and  completeness of the description of the proposed CP in the CP-DD and state its opinion on  the accuracy and completeness of the description. 7.5. Avoidance of double or revived registration 133. The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirement relating to double or revived  registration contained in the activity standard based on the publicly available information  and/or the information provided by the activity participants upon its request. 7.6. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 134. The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are compatible with  the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance  with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. 135. If the DOE, based on local and sectoral knowledge, is aware that comparable information  is available from credible sources other than those used in the CP-DD, it shall cross-check  the CP-DD against such other sources to confirm that the proposed CP meets the  applicability conditions of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. 136. The DOE shall determine whether the proposed CP has selected the standardized  baselines where their selection is mandatory. 137. If the DOE cannot determine the applicability of the selected methodology, methodological  tool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed CP, the DOE shall request a clarification  on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and  clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and/or the “Procedure:  Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. 7.6.1. Deviation from methodology or methodological tool 138. The DOE may seek a clarification from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a  deviation from the selected methodology or methodological tool in accordance with the  “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological  tools” prior to the inclusion of the proposed CP, if the DOE, when performing validation for  the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA, or upon request from the activity  participants, finds that, due to a project-specific13 issue implying that a revision of the 13 Examples of project-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following:  (a) The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a  certain method. The activity participants of the proposed CP face a difficulty in acquiring the  specified instrumentation or a difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however, they  can achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative instrumentation or  measurement method;  (b) A proposed CP does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology for a certain  parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the CP to estimate the parameter with  equal reliability and accuracy;  30 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  methodology and/or methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the  CP deviated from:  (a) The selected methodology or methodological tool; or  (b) Sections in the selected methodology or methodological tool that are not  standardized by the selected standardized baselines, if the proposed CP applies  standardized baselines. 139. The DOE shall submit an assessment of the case including demonstration that the  deviation does not require revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool,  and shall include a description of the impact of the deviation on GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals by the CP. 140. Alternatively, if the DOE considers that a revision of the selected methodology or  methodological tool would be required to address the project situation, then the DOE shall  submit, or shall request the activity participants to submit, a request for revision of the  selected methodology or methodological tool in accordance with the “Procedure:  Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and,  upon its revision, proceed with a request for post-registration changes to the registered  A6.4 PoA to apply the revised version. 7.7. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 7.7.1. Host Party methodological requirements 141. The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are applied in a way  to comply with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party  in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. 7.7.2. Project boundary, sources, leakage and greenhouse gases 142. If the applied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines allow the activity  participants to choose whether a GHG source or gas is to be included within the project  boundary, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have justified that  choice and whether the justification provided is reasonable. 143. If the DOE identifies GHG emission sources that will be affected by the implementation of  the CP and which are expected to contribute more than 1 per cent of the overall expected  average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, and are not addressed  by the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines, the DOE shall  (c) A minor deviation is sought for a project-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative.  For example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5 per  cent of rated capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the  plant has never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated  capacity (20 per cent below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying  conservative approaches to calculate the emission reduction in such a project-specific case;  (d) A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to  project-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology, for example, a well-justified  conservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to address  uncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period.  31 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  request a clarification of, revision to, or deviation from, the methodologies or the  standardized baselines, as appropriate, in accordance with the “Procedure: Development,  revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” or the “Procedure:  Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. 7.7.3. Baseline scenario 144. If the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the  identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on its expertise  and local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are considered by  the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those required by the  methodologies are realistic and credible in the context of the proposed CP and that no  alternative scenario has been excluded. The DOE shall assess whether a more ambitious  baseline requirement, as determined by the host Party and approved by the Supervisory  Body, has been applied in the identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, if  applicable. 145. The DOE shall determine whether the most plausible baseline scenario identified is  reasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the CP-DD. 146. Notwithstanding paragraphs 144 and 145 above, if the proposed CP applies an approved  standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the DOE shall determine  whether the baseline scenario for the CP is the scenario specified by the applied  standardized baseline. 7.7.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 147. The DOE shall assess whether the identification and the description in the CP-DD of the  BAU scenario or reference benchmark emissions comply with the requirements of the  activity standard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 7.7.5. Demonstration of additionality 148. The DOE shall determine whether the additionality of the proposed CP is demonstrated in  accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  applied methodological tools for demonstration of additionality, if any, by verifying the  reliability and credibility of all data used, and rationales, assumptions and justifications  provided by the activity participants, and critically assessing the evidence presented, using  local knowledge and sectoral and financial expertise. 149. Notwithstanding paragraph 148 above, if the proposed CP applies an approved  standardized baseline that standardizes additionality, the DOE shall determine whether  the project meets the additionality criteria in the applied standardized baseline. 150. The DOE shall determine if the proposed CP complies with all conditions of the eligibility  criteria in the PoA-DD as per paragraph 33(g) above that ensure that the CP meets the  requirements for demonstration of additionality.  32 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 7.7.6.

The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring plan is in accordance with the  requirements of activity standard and has been developed in accordance with the  description in the generic CP-DD of how to develop a monitoring plan and is feasible to  implement, including the feasibility of the monitoring arrangements, and whether the  means of implementation of the monitoring plan, including the data management and  quality assurance and quality control procedures, are sufficient to ensure that GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals can be reported ex post and verified. 163. If the activity participants chose to delay the submission of the monitoring plan for the  proposed CP in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE shall confirm and  document that the submission of the monitoring plan is delayed. 164. For component projects involving removals and emission reduction component projects  with reversal risks, the DOE shall assess the reviewed and updated monitoring plan every  five years from the start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances as  paragraph 153 above. 7.8. Start date, crediting period type and duration 165. The DOE shall determine whether the start date of the CP is on or after 1 January 2021,  on or after the start date of the PoA period and whether it has been determined in  accordance with the relevant requirements of the activity standard.  34 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 166.

If the activity participants wish to change the start date of the crediting period of an  included CP, the DOE shall determine whether the proposed change complies with the  relevant requirements in the activity standard. 199. The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the change complies with the relevant  requirements in the activity standard. 8.2.3.3. Inclusion of monitoring plan 200. If the activity participants chose to omit a monitoring plan at the inclusion of the CP and  wish to include it thereafter, the DOE shall determine whether the design of the monitoring  plan and other sections of the CP-DD comply with the relevant requirements in the activity  standard and in accordance with the relevant requirements contained in section 7.7.8  above. 201. The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the monitoring plan in the revised CP-DD  complies with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. 8.2.3.4. Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or A6.4 SD Tool  forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form,  A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring from the  applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or other applied  methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 202. If the activity participants wish to make a permanent change to the registered monitoring  plan, or if the monitoring permanently deviates from the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have described the  nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed alternative  monitoring for the CP in the revised CP-DD, the permanent changes or deviation, and  whether the proposed alternative monitoring complies with the relevant requirements in  the activity standard. 203. The DOE shall determine whether the permanent change to the registered monitoring plan  in the revised CP-DD is in line with the description in the generic CP-DD in the registered  PoA-DD of how to develop the monitoring plan for each of the corresponding CPs and is  in compliance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 204. If the DOE determines that the permanent change or the permanent deviation described  in the revised CP-DD is not in line with the description in the generic CP-DD in the  registered PoA-DD of how to develop the monitoring plan for each of the corresponding  CPs, the DOE shall request the activity participants to prepare a revised PoA-DD to  accommodate the permanent changes or permanent deviation for approval by the  Supervisory Body first. Upon such revision of the PoA-DD, the DOE shall determine  41 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  whether the revised description is in compliance with the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents. If the revised description deviates from them, the DOE shall determine  whether the conservative assumptions or discount factors are applied. 205. The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring  plan or the permanent deviation of the monitoring from the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines, or other applied methodological regulatory documents are  likely to lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation of GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals. If the DOE considers that the permanent changes or the permanent  deviation will lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation, the DOE shall request  the activity participants to apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the  calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals will not be overestimated as a result of the permanent change or the permanent  deviation. 206. The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the permanent changes or the permanent  deviation comply with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. 207. The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the A6.4 SD Tool forms  (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental  and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form),  provided as part of the revised CP-DD are in compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool and  relevant provisions of the activity standard. 208. For component projects involving removals and emission reduction component projects  with reversal risks, the DOE shall determine whether the monitoring plan and the risk  assessment plan were reviewed and updated every five years and in the circumstances  specified in paragraph 153 above, in accordance with relevant provisions of the activity  standard, removals standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 8.2.3.5. Changes to the programme or project design 209. If the activity participants wish to make a proposed change or have made an actual change  to the design of a registered A6.4 PoA or to the design of an included CP, the DOE shall  determine whether the change complies with the relevant requirements in the activity  standard. 210. The DOE shall determine whether the change to the design of the registered A6.4 PoA is  for one or more of the following purposes:  (a) To expand the programmes’ boundary to expand the geographic coverage or to  include additional host Parties;  (b) To remove a methodology and/or standardized baseline from the registered  PoA-DD;  (c) To change the capacity range specified in the registered PoA-DD;  (d) To change the design of the PoA;  (e) To add new components or extend/add technologies/measures, provided that they  comply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that the host Party would approve in  accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs;  42 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (f) To remove a component or technology/measure described in the registered PoA-  DD;  (g) To change the technologies/measures specified in the registered PoA-DD;  (h) To change a generic CP to:  (i) Apply an applicable and valid standardized baseline to determine baseline  emissions or parameter values;  (ii) Switch from an ex post to an ex ante determination of parameter values for  calculating baseline emissions using a standardized baseline;  (i) To make any consequential changes to the application of methodologies and/or  the standardized baselines resulting from the changes referred to in  subparagraphs (b)− (h) above;  (j) To voluntarily update the applied methodologies to a later valid version of the same  methodologies, or to change to another methodology;15  (k) To make any consequential changes to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in  the registered A6.4 PoA, resulting from the changes referred to in subparagraphs  (a)− (j) above; 211. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to expand the geographic coverage or to  include additional host Parties, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:  (a) The registered PoA-DD has been revised to reflect the changes, in particular the  eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs;  (b) The baseline setting described in the relevant generic CP in the PoA-DD is  applicable to the expanded PoA boundary;  (c) In the case of inclusion of additional host Parties, each DNA of the new host Parties  has provided an approval of the PoA in accordance with section 6.2.11 above, and  confirmed that the host Party and the other participating Party, if applicable, have  provided authorization of activity participants in accordance with section 6.2.12  above. 212. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to revise the eligibility criteria for the  inclusion of CPs, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:  (a) The revision of the eligibility criteria complies with the provisions and conditions set  out in the activity standard. If the revision does not fall under any of the categories  specified in the activity standard, the DOE shall direct the activity participants to  seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the appropriateness of the revision  in accordance with the “Procedure: Consideration of unsolicited letters to the  Supervisory Body”; 15 As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to apply a revised version  of the methodology that is different from the version applied for the registration of the PoA. However,  the activity cycle procedure also specifies that no new CPs can be included in the PoA until a post-  registration change to the PoA to reflect the requirements of the new version of the methodology is  approved by the Supervisory Body.  43 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (b) The revised eligibility criteria meet the requirements of the methodologies and the  standardized baselines that are applied in the PoA;  (c) The registered PoA-DD is revised appropriately to reflect the revised eligibility  criteria for inclusion of CPs. 213. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to remove a methodology and/or  standardized baseline, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:  (a) The change only involves the removal and no addition of a methodology and/or  standardized baseline;  (b) The removal of the methodology and/or the standardized baseline does not affect  the physical design of, and the end-use service provided by, the CPs that apply  the methodologies and the standardized baselines that remain (i.e. the  methodologies and the standardized baselines that were not removed). 214. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to change the design of the PoA such that  it may result in an increase of the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions  or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the PoA through the inclusion and  implementation of CPs, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:  (a) The registered PoA-DD has been revised to reflect the changes;  (b) The DNA(s) of respective host Party(ies) have provided approval in accordance  with the relevant requirements in the activity cycle procedure. 215. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to change the capacity range specified in  the generic CP-DD in the registered PoA-DD, the DOE shall assess and confirm that the  change does not disqualify the applicability of the applied methodologies, applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. 216. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to add new components or extend/add  technologies/measures, provided that they comply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that  the host Party would approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs, the DOE  shall assess and confirm that the change introduces complementary  technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy transfer to/from the original  technologies/measures. 217. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to remove a component or  technology/measure described in the generic CP-DD in the registered PoA-DD, the DOE  shall assess and confirm that the removal of the component or technology/measure does  not remove the applicability of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. 218. If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to change the technologies/measures  specified in the generic CP-DD in the registered PoA-DD, the DOE shall assess and  confirm that the change only results in the same technologies/measures as in the  registered technologies/measures as per the definition of “the same technologies” in the  activity standard. 219. The DOE shall assess whether any change to the registered A6.4 PoA may result in an  increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals expected to be achieved by the PoA, and if positive, such increase is clearly  indicated in the revised PoA-DD.  44 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 220. If the design of an included CP has been changed, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:  (a) The reason for the increase in the capacity, if applicable, is not within the control  of the activity participants. If the reason is within the control, the revised estimation  of GHG emission reductions due to the change is within the applicable limit allowed  in accordance with the activity standard;  (b) The increase or decrease in the capacity specified in the included CP-DD falls  within the capacity range of the generic CP;  (c) The new components or extended/added technologies/measures are covered by  the generic CP in the registered PoA-DD and introduce complementary  technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy transfer to/from the  technologies/measures described in the included CP-DD;  (d) The modified/changed technologies/measures are covered by the generic CP and  result in the same technologies/measures as in the included CP-DD as per the  definition of “the same technologies” in the activity standard;  (e) The included CP with the changes is within the scope of the generic CP;  (f) The eligibility criteria for these technologies/measures are specified in the generic  CP;  (g) The change does not result in an increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the PoA,  otherwise the DOE shall request the activity participants to proceed first with a  post-registration change to the registered PoA-DD to reflect the change of  increasing the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals expected to be achieved by the registered A6.4 PoA in which the CP is  included. 221. If the DOE establishes that the change of the design of the included CP, involving capacity  increase or addition of a new technology or measure, results in exceeding the maximum  annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be  achieved by the registered A6.4 PoA in which the CP is included, the DOE shall confirm  whether:  (a) A post-registration change to the registered PoA-DD has also been proposed by  the activity participants to reflect the change of increasing the maximum annual  amount;  (b) The DNA of the host Party of the PoA for which the maximum annual amount has  been increased has provided an approval of the increase in accordance with the  activity cycle procedure. 222. When conducting the validations referred to in paragraphs 215−220 above, in case of  actual changes, the DOE shall, by means of an on-site inspection (where conducted in  accordance with paragraph 125 or 126 above) and a review of the revised PoA-DD or CP-  DD submitted by the activity participants that describes the nature and extent of the actual  changes, determine whether this description accurately reflects the implementation,  operation and monitoring of the modified A6.4 PoA or included CP. 223. When conducting the validations referred to in paragraphs 215−220 above, by means of  an on-site inspection or other means of validation carried out in accordance with paragraph  45 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  125 or 126 above, the DOE shall assess the impacts of the actual changes on the  monitoring plan, the level of accuracy of the monitoring activity, the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 224. The DOE shall, by means of reviewing the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD against applicable  additionality and other methodological requirements, determine whether the proposed or  actual change would adversely affect the conclusions of the validation report on the  registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP with regard to:  (a) The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents with which the PoA or CP has been registered or included;  (b) The compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (c) The level of accuracy and completeness of the monitoring for the PoA or the CP;  (d) The additionality of the PoA or CP;  (e) Compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool;  (f) The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA. 225. If the DOE determines that the proposed or actual change affects the additionality of the  registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP, the DOE shall determine whether the  demonstration of the impacts of the changes on the additionality is based on all original  input data. 226. Notwithstanding paragraph 225 above, if the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP uses  an approved standardized baseline that standardizes additionality, and if the proposed or  actual change affects the additionality of the PoA or the included CP, the DOE shall  determine whether the demonstration of the impacts of the change on the additionality is  based on the additionality criteria identified in the applied standardized baseline. 227. The DOE shall assess whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD complies with all the  requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 228. If the activity participants have voluntarily updated the applied methodologies and/or  standardized baselines to a later valid version of them, or changed to other methodologies  or standardized baselines, the DOE shall confirm that the revised PoA-DD meets all  requirements of the updated/changed methodologies, including the standards,  methodological tools and guidelines applied in accordance with the updated/changed  methodologies and/or the updated/changed standardized baselines. 229. If the changes to the programme or project design affect the identification, assessment or  monitoring of environmental, social or sustainable development impacts, the DOE shall  assess whether the impacts caused by the changes were assessed and revised versions  of the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form (if applicable) and A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form were provided. The DOE shall assess, prior to or as part of the  46 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  first verification of emission reductions or net removals, whether the revised A6.4 SD Tool  forms are in compliance with requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. 230. The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the proposed or actual change complies with  the relevant requirements in the activity standard. 231. The DOE shall state its opinion on:  (a) A description of the proposed or actual change as compared to the description in  the registered PoA-DD or CP-DD;  (b) An assessment of when the change occurred or will occur, reasons for the change  taking place, whether the change would have been known prior to the registration  of the A6.4 PoA or the inclusion of the CP, how the change would impact the overall  operation/ability of the PoA or CP to deliver GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals as stated in the PoA-DD or CP-DD, and whether the revised estimation  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals due to the changes are within  the applicable limits allowed in accordance with the activity standard;  (c) An assessment of whether the change would adversely affect the conclusions of  the validation report on the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP with regard to:  (i) The applicability and application of: (1) the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological  regulatory documents with which the PoA or the CP has been registered or  included; (2) the later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and/or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents or other methodologies and/or standardized baselines that the  PoA or the CP has been updated/changed to;  (ii) The project boundary of the CP and any associated leakages due to the  changes;  (iii) The compliance of the revised monitoring plan with the applied  methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents;  (iv) The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring of the PoA or the  CP compared with the requirements contained in the registered monitoring  plan;  (v) The additionality of the PoA or the CP;  (vi) Compliance with SD Tool;  (vii) The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA. 232. In validating the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD containing the proposed or actual change, and  in preparing the opinion, the DOE shall include the information on how:  47 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (a) The proposed revision ensures that the level of accuracy and completeness16 in  the monitoring and verification process is not reduced as a result of the revision.  The DOE shall, using objective evidence, assess the accuracy and completeness  of each proposed change to the registered monitoring plan, including the frequency  of measurements, the quality of monitoring equipment (e.g. calibration  requirements) and the quality assurance and quality control procedures;  (b) The proposed revision complies with all requirements of:  (i) The applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents; or  (ii) The updated/changed methodologies, including the standards,  methodological tools and guidelines applied in accordance with the  updated/changed methodologies, and/or the updated/changed standardized  baselines, if the applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines have  been voluntarily updated to a later valid version of them or changed to other  methodologies or standardized baselines;  (iii) The findings of previous verification and certification reports, if any, have  been taken into account. 8.2.3.6. Change of activity participant 233. If, subsequent to the registration of the A6.4 PoA, the activity participants have been  changed, either the DOE undertaking the next inclusion of a proposed CP, or the DOE  that submits the next request for issuance of Article 6.4 emission reductions (A6.4ERs) for  the PoA, or the DOE that submits the next post-registration change request for the PoA,  whichever is earlier, shall determine whether the new activity participant has been  authorized by the host Party of, or any other participating Party in, the PoA in accordance  with the activity cycle procedure. 234. The DOE shall submit the validation opinion to the secretariat in accordance with the  activity cycle procedure. 235. Notwithstanding the timing referred to in paragraph 233 above, the DOE shall submit the  validation opinion to the secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle procedure if the  activity participants wish the DOE to do so before the next inclusion of a proposed CP, the  next request for issuance of A6.4ERs or the next post-registration change request for the  PoA. 8.2.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme 236. The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to registration or  coverage by a programme, under any other international, regional, national, or subnational  or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme contained in the activity standard based  on the publicly available information and/or the information provided by the activity  participants upon its request. 16 Completeness refers to inclusion of all relevant information for assessment of GHG emission reductions  and the information supporting the methods applied as required. For example, if the DOE identifies an  on-site generator for emergency use which was not included in the registered monitoring plan during  the verification process, the monitoring of fuel consumption of this generator should be included in the  monitoring plan  48 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 8.3. Validation report 237. In its validation report for the post-registration changes, the DOE shall:  (a) Report on all items listed in paragraph 120 above except for its subparagraph  120(g) above;  (b) Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusion on the assessment of:  (i) Whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD is prepared using the valid version  of the applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable;  (ii) Whether the information transferred to the later valid version of the PoA-DD  or CP-DD form is materially the same as that in the registered PoA-DD or  CP-DD, as applicable;  (iii) Whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD is prepared in both track-change and  clean versions;  (iv) Whether the revised A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form  and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form are prepared using the valid  version of the applicable forms and following the instructions therein, as  applicable;  (v) The compliance of the proposed or actual post-registration changes with the  requirement for post-registration changes conducted in accordance with  sections 8.1–8.2 above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the  activity participants and how they have been addressed by them. 238. The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the validation outcome, containing:  (a) A positive validation opinion and the date of submission of the validation report as  part of the request for approval of post-registration changes to the secretariat; or  (b) A negative validation opinion, including the reasons for the post-registration  changes as documented having been determined as not complying with the  relevant requirements for post-registration changes. 9. Verification of implementation and monitoring 9.1. Objective of verification 239. The DOE shall conduct a thorough and independent assessment of the implementation  and the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by a registered  A6.4 PoA and the included CPs against the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and  requirements. 9.1.1. Overarching requirements 240. The DOE shall assess and determine whether the implementation and operation of the  registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs, and the steps taken to report GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals, comply with the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules  and requirements. This assessment shall involve a review of relevant documentation as  49 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  well as, where conducted in accordance with paragraphs 264–265 below, an on-site  inspection(s). For an on-site inspection(s), the DOE may apply a sampling approach in  accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed  by the Supervisory Body. 241. The DOE shall assess whether the data collection system meets the requirements of the  registered monitoring plan as per the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. 242. The DOE shall:  (a) Determine whether the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs have been  implemented and are operating in accordance with the registered PoA-DD and CP-  DDs;  (b) Determine whether GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals have been  monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan(s). 9.1.2. Other requirements 243. The DOE shall assess both quantitative and qualitative information on GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals provided in the monitoring report.17 244. In addition to the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall review:  (a) The registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs, including the registered monitoring plan(s)  and/or the changes to the registered PoA-DD or CP-DDs, and the corresponding  validation opinions;  (b) The validation report;  (c) Previous verification and certification reports, if any;  (d) The applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other  applied methodological regulatory documents;  (e) The monitoring results of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable  development impacts of the included CPs;  (f) Any other information and references relevant to the GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by the included CPs (e.g. Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, data on electricity generation in the national  grid or laboratory analysis, national regulations). 245. In addition to reviewing the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall determine whether  the activity participants have addressed the FARs identified during the previous validation  or verification. 17 Quantitative information comprises the reported numbers in the monitoring report. Qualitative  information comprises information on internal management controls, calculation procedures, procedures  for transfer of data, frequency of the monitoring reports, and review and internal audit of calculations.  50 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 9.1.3. Quality of evidence 246. When verifying the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the DOE  shall confirm that there is an audit trail that contains the evidence and records that validate  or invalidate the stated figures. The audit trail shall include the source documents that form  the basis for assumptions and other information underlying the GHG data. 247. When assessing the audit trail, the DOE shall:  (a) Address whether there is sufficient evidence available, both in terms of frequency  (time period between evidence) and coverage (in covering the full monitoring  period);  (b) Address the source and nature of the evidence (external or internal, oral or  documented);  (c) Cross-check the monitoring report against other sources, such as comparable  information, where available, from sources other than those used in the monitoring  report, to determine whether the stated figures are correct. 248. The DOE shall only certify GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that are based  on verifiable evidence. 9.1.4. Application of materiality 9.1.4.1. General 249. The concept of materiality is applicable to the verification of monitored GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals achieved by all types of registered A6.4 PoAs. It is not  applicable to:  (a) Uncertainties related to measurement;  (b) Addressing temporary deviations and permanent changes to the registered  monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines,  regardless of whether the corresponding GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals are above or below materiality thresholds. 250. A DOE that plans and conducts verification using the concept of materiality shall achieve  a reasonable level of assurance that the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals are free from material errors, omissions or misstatements in accordance with  paragraphs 251−261 below. 251. An omission, misstatement, or erroneous reporting of information is material if it might  lead, at an aggregated level, to an overestimation of the total GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by a registered A6.4 PoA equal to or higher than the following  thresholds:  (a) 0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for registered A6.4 PoAs  achieving a total emission reduction or removal equal to or more than 500,000 t  CO2 eq per year;18 18 A year refers to a period of 12 consecutive months.  51 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (b) 1 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for registered A6.4 PoAs  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of between 300,000 and  500,000 t CO2 eq per year;  (c) 2 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for registered A6.4 PoAs  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of 300,000 t CO2 eq per year or  less. 252. Recognizing that circumstances may exist that could cause the information reported by  the activity participants to be materially misstated, the DOE should plan and perform  verifications with an attitude of professional scepticism and rely on its professional  judgment when applying the concept of materiality. 253. The application of the concept of materiality and reasonable level of assurance implies  that some data or information may not be checked. However, the DOE should design its  verification and sampling plans to detect all material errors, omissions or misstatements,  and any unchecked data or information should not contain any material errors, omissions  or misstatements. A DOE’s verification opinion applies to 100 per cent of the data and  information, even if the DOE may not have checked the entire data set and information. 254. Applying the concept of materiality does not mean that identified errors are not to be  corrected; if an error, omission or misstatement is identified by the DOE, regardless of  whether it is material or not, the DOE shall request the activity participants to address it. 9.1.4.2. Consideration of materiality in planning verification 255. The DOE should:  (a) Identify the materiality threshold referred to in paragraph 251 above that  corresponds to the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that  the specific registered A6.4 PoA will achieve;  (b) Understand the environment in which the registered A6.4 PoA operates, the  sources of project emissions within the project boundary and the leakage, the  monitoring activities, the equipment used to monitor or measure project data, the  origin and application of data used to calculate or measure the emissions, the data  flow, the internal quality control system, and the overall organization with respect  to monitoring and reporting;19  (c) Conduct a risk assessment to identify and assess the risks of individual or  aggregated material errors, omissions or misstatements that may occur within the  threshold based on the elements referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above;  (d) Design verification plans, audit procedures20 and sampling plans whose type,  timing21 and extent are based on and are responsive to the assessed risks of  material errors, omissions or misstatements. 19 Adapted from European Union. 2007. Commission Decision of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for  the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the  European Parliament and of the Council. 20 In accordance with section 9.2.5. 21 For example, timing may refer to the specific time intervals for which the DOE may draw its samples.  52 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 256. The materiality thresholds apply to the total GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals actually achieved. When planning verification, the DOE should apply the  applicable materiality threshold to the reported total emission reductions or removals. If,  as a result of the verification, the initially reported total emission reductions or removals is  revised, the DOE should reapply the materiality threshold to the revised total emission  reductions or removals and, if needed, make adjustments to its verification plans and  sampling plans. 9.1.4.3. Consideration of materiality in conducting verification 257. The DOE should:  (a) Apply verification plans, audit procedures and sampling plans;  (b) Assess potential errors, omissions and misstatements against the materiality  threshold to determine whether they are material individually or in aggregate and  whether further audit procedures are needed. 258. If an error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE should be aware that it may  not be an isolated occurrence and may be a systemic reoccurring error. For example,  other errors may exist if the DOE identifies that the error, omission or misstatement arose  from a breakdown in the activity participants’ internal quality control and quality assurance  system. 259. If an immaterial error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall request the  activity participants to address it and should determine whether additional audit  procedures should be conducted in order to reach a reasonable level of assurance that  the verified GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are free from material error,  omission or misstatement. 260. If a material error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall, depending on the  circumstances of the error, immediately request the activity participants to address it, or  conduct additional audit procedures to confirm or determine the context and magnitude of  the error, omission or misstatement and then request the activity participants to address  it. 261. If further audit procedures are necessary, the DOE may consider whether the overall  verification plans and sampling plans need to be revised. 9.1.5. Standard auditing techniques 262. The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. 263. In assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of verification specified  throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including  but not limited to:  (a) Document review, involving:  (i) A review of data and information;  (ii) A review of the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological  regulatory documents, paying particular attention to the frequency of  53 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  measurements, the quality of metering equipment including calibration  requirements, and the quality assurance and quality control procedures;  (iii) An evaluation of data management and the quality assurance and quality  control system in the context of their influence on the generation and  reporting of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (b) Follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection, telephone/e-mail interviews), including:  (i) An assessment of the implementation and operation of the included CPs as  per the included CP-DDs or latest approved revised CP-DDs;  (ii) A review of information flows for generating, aggregating and reporting the  monitoring parameters;  (iii) Interviews with relevant personnel to determine whether the operational and  data collection procedures are implemented in accordance with the  registered monitoring plans;  (iv) Cross-checks between the information provided in the monitoring report and  data from other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase  records or similar data sources to determine whether the information in the  monitoring report is reliable;  (v) A check of the monitoring equipment, including calibration performance, and  observations of monitoring practices against the requirements of the  registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (vi) A review of calculations and assumptions made in determining the GHG data  and GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (vii) An identification of quality control and quality assurance procedures in place  to prevent, or identify and correct, any errors or omissions in the reported  monitoring parameters;  (c) Sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for  A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body, including:  (i) A random sampling for cases where the activity participants did not apply a  sampling approach to monitoring;  (ii) An acceptance sampling or another sampling approach for cases where the  activity participants applied a sampling approach to monitoring. 264. It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at verification for an included  CP if:  (a) It is the first verification for the DOE with regard to this CP;  (b) More than three years have elapsed since the last on-site inspection conducted for  verification for the CP; or  54 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (c) The CP has achieved more than 300,000 t CO2 eq of GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals since the last verification when an on-site inspection was  conducted. 265. For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 264 above, it is optional for the DOE to  conduct an on-site inspection at verification. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site  inspection as a means of verification, it shall describe the alternative means used and  justify that they are sufficient for the purpose of verification. If the DOE conducts a remote  inspection as an alternative means to an on-site inspection, the DOE should follow the  guidance contained in Appendix 1. 266. If any issue related to the project design, including those attributable to the lack of on-site  inspection at the previous verification, is identified at the verification, the DOE that  detected the issue shall rectify it through the post-registration change process in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 267. Where no specific means of verification are specified, the DOE should apply the standard  auditing techniques described in paragraph 263 above. 9.1.6. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests 268. If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order  to determine whether the implementation or the operation of the registered A6.4 PoA and  the included CPs, or the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals,  meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure  that these issues are accurately identified, formulated, discussed and concluded in the  verification and certification report. 269. The DOE shall raise a CAR if one of the following situations occurs:  (a) Non-compliance with the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents is found in monitoring and reporting and has not been sufficiently  documented by the activity participants, or if the evidence provided to prove  conformity is insufficient;  (b) Modifications to the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 PoA or the  included CPs, or the monitoring or GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals,  have not been sufficiently documented by the activity participants;  (c) Mistakes have been made by the activity participants in applying assumptions,  data or calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that will  impact the quantity of emission reductions or removals;  (d) Issues identified in a FAR during the previous validation or verification have not  been resolved by the activity participants. 270. The DOE shall raise a CL if the information provided by the activity participants is  insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism  rules and requirements have been met. 271. The DOE shall raise a FAR if issues related to monitoring and reporting that require  attention and/or adjustment at the next verification are identified.  55 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0 272. The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify  the monitoring report, or provide additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s  concerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs. 273. The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its verification and certification report.  This reporting shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity  participants, the means of verification of such responses, and references to any resulting  changes in the monitoring report or its supporting documents. 9.2. Verification of compliance with specific requirements for issuance 9.2.1. General 274. The DOE shall determine, by following the general verification requirements referred to in  sections 5 and 9.1 above, whether the monitoring complies with all relevant requirements  for monitoring as contained in the activity standard. 275. The DOE shall:  (a) Identify the included CPs that it shall consider for verification in accordance with  the methods/procedure to be used and specified in the registered PoA-DD for  verification of the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  achieved by the CPs. If the registered A6.4 PoA has more than one host Party and  a host Party’s DNA withdraws its approval of the PoA and/or its authorization of  the activity participants, the DOE shall identify only the CPs that are unaffected by  the withdrawal;  (b) Take into account the possible existence of included CPs complying with different  versions of the registered PoA-DD22 and the need to account for this in its sampling  approach to ensure that a statistically sound sample of CPs from each version of  the PoA-DD is being verified;  (c) Systematically verify and certify the correct implementation and operation of the  record-keeping system. 276. The DOE shall include in its verification and certification report a description of how it  applied the methods/procedures for the purpose of verification. The DOE shall include in  its verification and certification report a description of the on-site inspection(s), where  conducted in accordance with paragraph 264 or 265 above. 277. If the activity participants have prepared a single monitoring report for a monitoring period,  the DOE shall confirm that the monitoring report covers all CPs included in the registered  A6.4 PoA whose crediting periods overlap with the monitoring period, and contains all  monitoring results obtained during the monitoring period. 278. If the activity participants have prepared multiple monitoring reports for separate batches  of CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA, the DOE shall confirm that all the monitoring  reports contain mutually exclusive batches of CPs, have the same monitoring period, and  collectively contain all monitoring results obtained during the period, and that each 22 CPs complying with the pre- and post-update of the PoA-DD due to the renewal of the PoA period or  post-registration changes during a PoA period have separate monitoring reports in accordance with the  activity standard.  56 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  monitoring report contains only monitoring results of the CPs that follow the same version  of the PoA-DD. 279. The DOE shall confirm that monitoring periods have been consecutive. Further, the DOE  shall confirm that CPs have been included in requests for issuance of A6.4ERs in a  consecutive manner; that is, when a CP has been covered in a request for issuance for a  monitoring period, the DOE shall confirm that a request for issuance for the previous  monitoring period that covered the particular CP has been published. 280. Notwithstanding paragraph 279 above, if the registered A6.4 PoA applies any of the  methodologies listed in the activity standard as potentially accruing negative emission  reductions in a monitoring period, the DOE shall confirm that A6.4ERs have been issued  for all CPs included in the PoA for the previous monitoring period. 281. A request for issuance of A6.4ERs shall relate to the A6.4ERs certified. 282. The DOE shall confirm the compliance with the requirements on:  (a) General requirements, including on:  (i) The implementation and operation of the A6.4 PoA and the included CPs as  per the description in the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs;  (ii) The continuous monitoring as per the registered monitoring plans;  (iii) The coverage of the monitoring period;  (iv) The presentation of monitoring results by year of occurrence of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals;  (v) The preparation of monitoring reports in chronological order and separation  of them by CPs that follow different versions of the PoA-DD;  (vi) The application of appropriate GWPs;  (vii) The maintenance of monitoring results;  (viii) The maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals to be achieved by the PoA as approved by the host Party;  (b) The avoidance of double issuance;  (c) The description of implemented PoA and included CPs;  (d) The description of monitoring system;  (e) Reversal related actions for component projects involving removals and emission  reductions component projects with reversal risks;  (f) The provision of data and parameters used;  (g) The calculation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.;  (h) The continuous engagement of stakeholders. 283. When verifying the compliance of the implementation and the operation of the registered  A6.4 PoA and included CPs and monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  57 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  removals with the requirements for implementation, operation and monitoring referred to  in paragraph 282 above, the DOE shall additionally follow the specific guidance on  verification regarding some of these requirements provided in sections 9.2.2−9.2.11  below. 284. The DOE shall ensure before submitting the request for first issuance for the PoA that the  host Party statement of authorization of the use of A6.4ERs was provided. 9.2.2. Avoidance of double issuance 285. The DOE shall determine whether the registered A6.4 PoA or any of the included CPs are  also registered, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional,  national or subnational GHG mitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance  based on the confirmation from such other crediting scheme, if applicable, public  information and any other information obtained from the activity participants. 286. If the DOE determines that the registered A6.4 PoA or any of the included CPs are  registered, or covered by a programme, under another crediting scheme, the DOE shall  additionally determine whether the activity participants have obtained a confirmation from  the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have not been or will not be credited under the  other crediting scheme. 9.2.3. Compliance of the monitoring report with the monitoring report form 287. The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report was completed using the valid  version of the applicable monitoring report form. 288. The DOE shall state its opinion on the compliance of the monitoring report with the relevant  form and instructions therein. 9.2.4. Compliance of the programme implementation with the registered programme of  activity design document 289. The DOE shall identify any concerns related to the conformity of the implemented  registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs and their operations with the registered PoA-  DD and CP-DDs and determine whether:  (a) The PoA and the CPs have been implemented and are operating in accordance  with the descriptions contained in the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs; or  (b) Any deviation or the proposed or actual changes in the implementation or operation  of the PoA and/or the CPs comply with the relevant requirements in the activity  standard, or  (c) The sum of the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  requested for issuance and the cumulative amount of GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals already issued for the PoA are up to the maximum annual  amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by the host  Party. 290. By means of an on-site inspection or other means of verification in accordance with  paragraph 264 or 265 above, the DOE shall assess that all physical features (e.g.  technology, project equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the included  58 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  CPs specified in the CP-DDs are in place and that the activity participants are operating  the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs as per the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs.  If an on-site inspection is not conducted, the DOE shall justify the rationale for the decision. 291. For each monitoring period, the DOE shall report:  (a) The implementation status of the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs. For  an included CP that consists of more than one site, the DOE shall describe the  status of implementation and the starting date of operation for each site. For an  included CP with phased implementation, the DOE shall state the progress of the  project achieved in each phase under verification. If the phased implementation is  delayed, the DOE shall describe the reasons and present the expected  implementation dates;  (b) The actual operation of the included CPs;  (c) The information (data and variables) provided in the monitoring report that is  different from that stated in the registered PoA-DD or CP-DDs and has caused an  increase in the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the  included CPs in the current monitoring period or is highly likely to increase the  estimates in the future monitoring periods;23  (d) An opinion on the cause of any increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by the included CPs in the current monitoring period  that was reported in monitoring report. 9.2.5. Compliance of the registered monitoring plan with applied methodologies and  standardized baselines 292. The DOE shall determine whether the registered monitoring plans are in accordance with  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents based on the actual implementation of the CPs. 293. For monitoring aspects that are not specified in the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the  DOE should highlight issues which may enhance the level of accuracy and completeness  of the registered monitoring plans. 294. The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the registered monitoring plans are in  accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 9.2.6. Monitoring activities 295. The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring of parameters related to GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals specified in the CP-DDs have been implemented in  accordance with the registered monitoring plans. 296. The DOE shall determine whether: 23 Discrepancies may include higher water availability than expected in the CP-DD, which may increase  the electricity output from a hydropower plant, or a higher plant load factor owing to higher bagasse  availability during the crushing season, which increases the production of steam and electricity.  59 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (a) The registered monitoring plans have been properly implemented and followed by  the activity participants;  (b) All parameters stated in the registered monitoring plans have been monitored and  updated as applicable;  (c) The equipment used for monitoring is controlled and calibrated in accordance with  the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  local/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification;  (d) Monitoring results are consistently recorded as per the approved frequency;  (e) Quality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied in accordance  with the registered monitoring plans. 297. If the activity participants applied a sampling approach to determine data and parameters  monitored, the DOE shall assess the compliance of the sampling efforts and surveys with  the validated sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for  A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 298. The DOE shall list each parameter required by the registered monitoring plans and state  how it verified the information flow (from data generation and aggregation, to recording,  calculation and reporting) for these parameters, including the values in the monitoring  report. 299. For CPs involving removals and emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the DOE shall  determine whether the monitoring report includes the following specific elements as per  the activity standard and the respective provisions of the removals standard and any  applied methodological regulatory documents:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the  monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;  (d) Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could  have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions along with a  summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period  covered by the monitoring report;  (e) Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent  with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered CP-DD;  (f) Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been  assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the  registered CP-DD. 9.2.7. Calibration frequency for measuring instruments 300. The DOE shall determine whether the calibration of the measuring equipment that has an  impact on the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the included  60 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  CPs is conducted by the activity participants at the frequency specified in the applied  methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied methodological  regulatory documents or the registered monitoring plans. 301. If, during the verification for a certain monitoring period, the DOE identifies that the  calibration has been delayed and the calibration has been implemented after the  monitoring period in consideration (i.e. the results of delayed calibration are available),  referring to the illustrative examples in Appendix 2, the DOE may conclude its verification,  provided the following conservative approach is adopted in the calculation of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals:  (a) Applying the maximum permissible error24 of the instrument to the measured  values taken during the period between the scheduled date of calibration and the  actual date of calibration, if the results of the delayed calibration do not show any  errors in the measuring equipment, or if the error is smaller than the maximum  permissible error; or  (b) Applying the error identified in the delayed calibration test, if the error is beyond  the maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment. 302. The DOE shall confirm that the error has been applied:  (a) In a conservative manner, such that the adjusted measured values of the delayed  calibration shall result in fewer GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that  are deemed achieved by the included CPs;  (b) For all measured values taken during the period between the scheduled date of  calibration and the actual date of calibration. 303. If the results of the delayed calibration are not available, or the calibration has not been  conducted at the time of the verification, the DOE, prior to finalizing the verification, shall  request the activity participants to conduct the required calibration and shall determine  whether the activity participants have calculated GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals conservatively using the approach mentioned in paragraph 301 above. 304. If the DOE determines that it is not possible for the activity participants to conduct the  calibration at the frequency specified in the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents or the  registered monitoring plans due to reasons beyond the control of the activity participants,25  the DOE shall follow the applicable requirements related to post-registration changes in  section 8 above. 305. If neither the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied  methodological regulatory documents nor the registered monitoring plans specify any  requirements for calibration frequency for the measuring equipment, the DOE shall  determine whether the equipment is calibrated either in accordance with the specifications  of the local/national standards or as per the manufacturer’s specification. If neither  local/national standards nor the manufacturer’s specification are available, the DOE shall 24 The  maximum permissible errors of all the measuring instruments are specified by the respective  manufacturers as part of their technical specifications. 25 For example, due to the contractual terms between the activity participant and purchasing/selling entities.  61 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  determine whether the equipment is calibrated in accordance with the specifications of the  international standards. 9.2.8. Reversal related actions for component projects involving removals and emission  reductions component projects with reversal risks 306. In cases of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that could potentially  lead to reversal, the DOE shall determine on the basis of transparent and verifiable  evidence whether the event as per the preliminary assessment report, prepared in  accordance with the requirements of the activity standard, respective provisions of the  removals standard on reversal-related actions and any other relevant applied  methodological regulatory documents, results in an actual reversal or not. 307. If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the  preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual  reversal and a monitoring report is prepared, the DOE shall determine whether the  monitoring report is in compliance with the requirements of the activity standard,  respective provisions of the removals standard and any other relevant applied  methodological regulatory documents. 308. The DOE shall also assess whether the monitoring report accurately estimates the  magnitude of reversals and correctly characterizes them as avoidable or unavoidable. 309. The DOE shall also assess whether following the submission of the monitoring report:  (a) The risk assessment of the affected CPs has been updated and the risk rating of  the affected CPs has been revised;  (b) The compliance with requirements and safeguards contained in the A6.4 SD Tool,  taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts caused by the  reversal and plans developed to prevent the recurrence of such negative  environmental and social impacts, has been reviewed. 9.2.9. Data and calculations of emission reductions or net removals 310. The DOE shall assess the data and calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals achieved by the included CPs and determine whether:  (a) A complete set of data for the specified monitoring period is available. If only partial  data are available because activity levels or non-activity parameters have not been  monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plans, the DOE shall  assess whether:  (i) The most conservative values approach is applied to the parameters for the  entire non-monitoring period in accordance with the provisions relating to  temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied  methodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard;  or  (ii) Alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-monitoring period are  described, whether they apply conservative assumptions or discount factors  to the calculations, and whether the alternative monitoring arrangements  have been approved by the Supervisory Body under the prior-approval track  or under the issuance track in accordance with the provisions relating to  62 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied  methodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard  and the activity cycle procedure;  (b) The information provided in the monitoring report has been cross-checked with  other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase records and  laboratory analysis;  (c) The calculations of baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals,  project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals, and leakage GHG emissions  have been carried out in accordance with the formulae and methods described in  the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (d) Where CPs involving removals also result in emission reductions, the accounting  of removals and emission reductions has been separated in the monitoring report  in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity.  (e) Any assumptions used in emission or removal calculations have been justified;  (f) Appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values, GWPs and other reference  values have been correctly applied;  (g) If the included CPs apply an approved standardized baseline that standardizes  baseline emissions, the standardized values of the parameters have been applied  using the correct version of the applied standardized baseline in accordance with  the activity standard. 311. The DOE shall provide:  (a) An indication of whether a complete set of data for the monitoring period was not  available because activity levels or non-activity parameters were not monitored in  accordance with the registered monitoring plans, and if so, whether the most  conservative values approach was applied or alternative monitoring arrangements  were proposed or have been approved by the Supervisory Body;  (b) A description of how the DOE cross-checked reported data;  (c) A confirmation that appropriate methods and formulae for calculating baseline  GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals, project GHG emissions or actual  net GHG removals and leakage GHG emissions, have been followed;  (d) An opinion on whether the assumptions, emission factors and default values that  were applied in the calculations have been justified. 9.2.10. Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts 312. The DOE shall verify the appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of information  provided in the monitoring of the environmental and social indicators in the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators  in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, as reported in a monitoring report. 313. If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in the A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form that were  63 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  validated at the registration, it shall provide its opinion to the activity participants on the  observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and  environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form  and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 314. The DOE shall review any input and comments received via continuous engagement of  local stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, conduct interviews with local  stakeholders, and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post  fulfilment of risk assessments and SD impacts due to the CP. 315. The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and  reported the parameters established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management  plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form submitted at the registration  stage. 316. For projects that successfully transitioned from the clean development mechanism (CDM)  and that prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits description report” in  accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool” at the time of transition,  the DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report includes the outcome of monitoring  of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on the document  describing how the activity participant monitors sustainable development co-benefits of  the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring results in accordance with  relevant provisions of the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4  mechanism”. 9.2.11. Continuous engagement of stakeholders 317. The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have received comments on  the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs from  local stakeholders after their registration or inclusion through the process of continuous  engagement of stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, and if so, determine  whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the comments in the  implementation or operation of the PoA or the CPs, as appropriate. 318. The DOE shall also determine whether comments on the compliance of the registered  PoA and included CPs with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have  been submitted from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations  and published on the UNFCCC website in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,  and if so, determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in  the comments. 9.3. Verification and certification report 319. The DOE shall report the results of its assessment in the verification and certification  report, including the following:  (a) An executive summary of the verification process and its conclusions;  (b) Details of the verification team, technical experts and internal reviewers involved,  together with their roles in the verification activity and, where conducted in  accordance with paragraphs 264−265 above, details of who conducted the on-site  inspection;  64 of 74  A6.4-STAN-AC-005 Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities Version 02.0  (c) A list of interviewees, documents reviewed, sampling approaches used by the DOE  and, where conducted in accordance with paragraphs 264–265 above, outline of  the on-site inspection.

Sectoral scopes of accreditation 10. To conduct the validation and/or verification/certification of an Article 6.4 project activity  (A6.4 project) or programme of activity (A6.4 PoA) and issue a validation and/or  verification/certification opinion and report, a DOE shall be accredited in the sectoral  scope(s) of the methodology(ies) applied by the A6.4 project or PoA. The sectoral scopes  as contained in appendix 2 to this standard are to be further revised at either of the  following: (a) upon approval of Article 6.4 methodological requirements, including  removals and related methodologies by the CMA and the Supervisory Body; and (b) upon  such approval of any new additional sectoral scopes as well as based upon the operational  efficiency of those proposed sectoral scopes gained from the experiences of actual  implementations.8 6. Legal status and matters 11. A DOE shall be an entity registered or incorporated under applicable national laws so that  it can function legally, enter into contracts, make decisions independently and may be  sued in its own name. 12. A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for handling of  judicial processes and maintain a record of all the judicial processes pending against it as  well as information of any judicial cases held in the past. “Judicial process” herein shall  mean any type of legal proceeding of any nature, including but not limited to administrative,  civil or criminal proceedings, before a national or international court or tribunal, or  administrative body, whether such proceeding is related to the DOE’s capacity under  Article 6.4 or otherwise. 13. The procedure referred to in paragraph 12 above shall include the following:  (a) The designation of personnel responsible for handling of judicial processes;  (b) The process for handling of the judicial case, including gathering and verifying all  necessary information for deciding what actions are to be taken in response to it;  (c) Ensuring that appropriate corrections and corrective actions are taken, if needed;  (d) Prompt reporting of the subject matter of a judicial process pending or instituted  against the AE/DOE to the UNFCCC secretariat, if the matter is such that it is  incompatible with its function as a DOE. 14. If the subject matter of a judicial process pending or instituted against the AE/DOE is such  that it is incompatible with its functions as a DOE as paragraph 13(d) above, the AE/DOE  shall promptly report the matter to the UNFCCC secretariat within 14 days. 15. Upon receipt of such report, the secretariat shall report the same to the Supervisory Body  within seven days for its consideration. Based on severity of the judicial case, the  Supervisory Body will decide whether to place the DOE under-  observation/suspension/withdrawal of accreditation as per the provisions defined under  Article 6.4 accreditation procedure. 8 The operational efficiency gained from the actual implementation experiences may result in the need to  reclassification of those proposed sectoral scopes.  9 of 54  A6.4-STAN-ACCR-001 Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.0 7.

The  accreditation assessments of compliance with section 10.3.1 of this standard will, inter alia, assess the  procedures/systems in place and the personnel evaluation records for demonstration of competence,  including for persons who are available on call and are not employees of the DOE. 21 Outsourcing to an entity, as described in paragraphs 56–61, shall not be considered use of external  individuals as described in paragraphs 62–64.  19 of 54  A6.4-STAN-ACCR-001 Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.0 60. A DOE may outsource functions to outsourced entities strictly in accordance with Appendix  1 below.22 61. If a DOE outsources one or more functions referred to in Appendix 1 below, the DOE shall  ensure that the outsourced entity does not further outsource this function. 62. If the outsourced entity conducts a contract review, the DOE shall ensure that the entity  has access to all necessary information, including the information required to conduct the  impartiality analysis in accordance with paragraph 90(c) below. 10.1.3.2. Outsourcing to an external individual 63. A DOE may use external individuals,23 who may be self-employed, part of a one-person  company or employed by any other company, as validators, verifiers, technical experts,  team leaders and technical reviewers, to supplement its internal resources, as provided  for in paragraph 52(b) above. In such cases, the DOE shall establish, document,  implement and maintain a procedure for engaging external individuals.24 64. The procedure referred to in paragraph 63 above shall require that:  (a) The DOE has:  (i) A contract with the external individual if the person is self-employed or part  of a one-person company; or  (ii) A contract with the external individual or a three-party contract with the  external individual and the company that employs her/him if the person is  employed by a company;  (b) The DOE takes full responsibility for any work carried out by an external individual  and obtains from the external individual a written agreement that they shall comply  with all of the DOE’s applicable policies and procedures, including on  confidentiality and impartiality/independence. The agreement shall explicitly  require the external individual to notify the DOE of any existing or prior association  with any activity participants of the A6.4 project or PoA that they may be assigned  to validate or verify/certify as well as actual or potential involvement in  identification, development or financing of A6.4 projects or PoAs;  (c) The external individual is familiar with the DOE’s procedures for validation or  verification/certification functions and has access to an up-to-date set of  documented procedures giving relevant instructions and information on the  Article 6.4 activities. 22 Validator/verifier services can be availed from an outsourced entity without assigning any management  functions, such that if the outsourced entity is providing only validators/verifiers and all validators/verifiers  are approved and nominated from the central office and all records are available in the central office, this  situation does not fall under outsourcing since no function has been assigned to the outsourced entity. 23 The use of external individuals, as described in paragraphs 62–64, shall not be considered outsourcing  to an entity as described in paragraphs 56–61. 24 An external individual operates as a regular member of a validation or verification/certification team or  technical review team, under the supervision of the AE/DOE. A one-person team may be constituted  using an external individual.  20 of 54  A6.4-STAN-ACCR-001 Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation Version: 01.0 65.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body of the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to  elaborate and further develop recommendations on the application of the requirements  referred to in chapter V.B (titled Methodologies) of the rules, modalities and procedures  for the Article 6.4 mechanism (RMPs)1 for consideration and adoption by the CMA at its  fourth session (November 2022). 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, requested the Supervisory Body to elaborate and further  develop recommendations for consideration and adoption by the CMA at its fifth session  (November–December 2023). It further requested the Supervisory Body, while developing  the recommendations, to consider broader inputs from stakeholders provided in a  structured public consultation process.2 1.2. Objectives 3. The objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for the development and  assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies. 2. Entry into force 4. This version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024. 3. Normative references 5. The “shall” requirements in this document are those that the user of this document (i.e.,  activity participants, host Parties, stakeholders, or the Supervisory Body) is obliged to  meet in order to claim conformance to this document. Other types of provisions in this  document include recommendations (“should”), permissions (“may”), possibilities and  capabilities (“can”) and items for inclusion in the work plan of the Supervisory Body (“will”).  Besides prescriptive recommendations, explanatory information is also included in this  document (e.g., summarizing the basis for or reasoning behind a requirement). 6. Reductions in emissions, increases in removals, as well as mitigation co-benefits of  adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans, are each and collectively  referred to as ”emission reductions or removals” (A6.4 ERs) in this document. 7. Mechanism projects, programmes of activities and component projects are collectively  referred to as “activity” or “activities” in this document. 1  See decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 6(d), for the request, available at  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10a01E.pdf#page_26 (English language  version), and the annex to 3/CMA.3 for the RMPs, contained in document  FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

The terms “technologies”, “measures” and “practices” are interchangeably used in this  document and refer to technologies, measures, and practices across all sectors. 9. Where scientific information is relied upon for methodologies, IPCC publications should  be considered as default source, if applicable and appropriate and unless more accurate  scientific information is available. 4. Methodology principles 10. Mechanism methodologies are intended to provide the basis for claim and assessment of  creditable emission reductions or removals, and whether activities satisfy additionality  requirements, and all relevant RMP and guidance from the SBM. 11. Paragraph 33 of the RMP applies to methodologies, and it is relevant to, inter alia,  baseline-setting, the avoidance of leakage, and the demonstration of additionality of  activities. 12. Paragraph 34 of the RMP sets out additional requirements, including with respect to  policies, national circumstances and reversals. 13. Paragraph 35 of the RMP frames the basic procedures for the development of  methodologies by host Parties, the Supervisory Body and activity participants. 14. Paragraph 36 of the RMP provides a choice of approaches for the baseline-setting and  requires the justification of the choice(s) made, including demonstration of consistency  with paragraph 33 of the RMP. 15. Paragraph 37 provides for host Parties and the Supervisory Body to develop standardized  baselines consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP. 16. Paragraph 38 of the RMP applies to the demonstration of additionality of activities and  identifies specific tests. 4.1. Encouraging ambition over time 17. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall encourage  ambition over time (…)”. 18. Mechanism methodologies shall apply increasingly ambitious baselines to encourage  ambition of activities over time, while taking into account host Party circumstances and  should facilitate the deployment of low carbon solutions and technologies as described in  paragraphs 19 and 20 below. 19. Mechanism methodologies should facilitate the deployment of technologies or measures  that are not widely used or available in specific locations, to facilitate knowledge transfer  and encourage deployment of technologies or measures that reduce the cost of  decarbonization and unlock investment in low-carbon solutions. 20. Mechanism methodologies should contain provisions that facilitate the inclusion of  progressively more efficient and less greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive technologies,  replicable and scalable mitigation activities, expanding the user base, broader geographic  coverage, and greater penetration of low-carbon solutions after initial deployment.  4 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 4.2. Being real, transparent, conservative, credible 21. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) be real,  transparent, conservative, credible (…)”. 22. Mechanism methodologies shall contain credible methods for estimating emission  reductions or removals to ensure that the results of Article 6.4 activities represent actual  tonnes of GHG emissions reduced or removed. Such estimations shall be based on up-  to-date scientific information and reliable data. 23. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require transparent descriptions  of the sources of data used, the assumptions made, the references used and the steps  followed in the estimation of the results of Article 6.4 activities, including equations where  necessary. 24. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that ensure conservative estimation of  emission reductions or removals from the measures applied, options chosen, or  assumptions made, and which should result in conservative estimates of the emission  reductions or removals from Article 6.4 activities. 25. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that Article 6.4 activities  have a robust monitoring, data capture and reporting system to ensure credibility. Where  secondary data is used, mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require  activity participants to provide justification that the source of data is appropriate, and the  data are conservative. 26. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to ensure that all emission reductions  or removals, are real, transparent, conservative, and credible by:  (a) Including robust, transparent and user-friendly measurement, reporting and  independent third-party verification systems;  (b) Requiring the use of technical performance standards that are data driven;  (c) Requiring transparent demonstration of changes in GHG emissions showing each  step in calculations and the results, and ensuring that calculated emission  reductions or removals are uniquely achieved by and attributable to the activity;  (d) Adopting life cycle approaches and considering emissions embodied in materials  and products, where relevant and practicable;  (e) Ensuring that information, including data sources and calculations are real,  transparent, conservative, accessible and credible;  (f) Choosing a conservative emissions baseline when multiple sources of data and  parameters are available to set the baseline;  (g) Including, where appropriate, the use of remote sensing and digital technologies  to enable transparent, accurate and credible calculation and estimation of emission  reductions and removals. 4.3. Establishing that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual 27. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) be below  ‘business as usual’ (…)”.  5 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 28. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that the baseline selected  for an emission reduction activity in accordance with paragraph 36 of the RMP shall be  demonstrated as being below ‘business-as-usual’ (BAU). BAU emissions are plausible  reference benchmarks or scenarios for GHG emissions prior to or in the absence of the  implementation of the activity. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall require  the identification of the BAU scenario or reference benchmark emissions and provide an  approach for their estimation. 29. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require activity participants to  calculate the difference between the baseline emissions estimated as per the  requirements in section 4.6 below and BAU emissions estimated as per paragraph 28  above as an annual and total amount with respect to the crediting period. This shall be  demonstrated in the project design document and at each renewal of the crediting period. 4.4. Contributing to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between  participating Parties 30. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall…contribute to the  equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between the participating Parties…”. 31. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions for contributing to the equitable  sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties, including the application of  conditions specified by the Designated National Authorities (DNAs) of the host Party.  These may also include one or more of the provisions below:  (a) Conditions to ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) of activities is  shorter than the lifetime of the technology implemented including any replacements  undertaken during the crediting period, where there is very high confidence that  emission reductions from the technology continue to be achieved beyond the end  of crediting period(s);  (b) Other approaches to fulfil the demonstration of equitable sharing of mitigation  benefits. 32. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that ensure that the sharing of  mitigation benefits between participating Parties tangibly supports the sustainable  development objectives of host Parties, such as through the use of the SD Tool in the  activity design and implementation. 33. Mechanism methodologies shall require the estimation of the mitigation benefits to the  host Party, taking into account the relevant provisions in paragraph 31 above. 4.5. Aligning with the NDC of each participating Party, if applicable, its LT-LEDS,  if it has submitted one, the long-term temperature goal of the Paris  Agreement and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement 34. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) in respect of  each participating Party, contribute to reducing emission levels in the host Party, and align  with its NDC, if applicable, its long-term low GHG emission development strategy, if it has  submitted one, and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement”. 35. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) align with the  long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (…)”.  6 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 36. Mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the activity, does not  constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party  with regard to the latest nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, if  applicable, its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-  LEDS), if it has submitted one, and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement  and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. 4.6. Approaches to set the baseline 37. Paragraph 36 of the RMP states that: “Each mechanism methodology shall require the  application of one of the approach(es) below to setting the baseline, while taking into  account any guidance by the Supervisory Body, and with justification for the  appropriateness of the choices, including information on how the proposed baseline  approach is consistent with paragraphs 33 and 35 in the RMP and recognizing that a host  Party may determine a more ambitious level at its discretion:  A performance-based approach, taking into account:  (i) Best available technologies that represent an economically feasible and  environmentally sound course of action, where appropriate;  (ii) An ambitious benchmark approach where the baseline is set at least at the  average emission level of the best performing comparable activities providing  similar outputs and services in a defined scope in similar social, economic,  environmental and technological circumstances;  (iii) An approach based on existing actual or historical emissions, adjusted  downwards to ensure alignment with paragraph 33 of the RMP.” 38. Paragraph 27 of the RMP states that “A host Party may specify to the Supervisory Body,  prior to participating in the mechanism: (a) Baseline approaches and other methodological  requirements…”. 39. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require justification of the  appropriateness of the choice of approach(es) identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP for  setting the baseline, with reference to the requirements of paragraphs 33 and 35 of the  RMP. 40. With regard to setting the baseline for emission reduction activities, factors affecting the  appropriateness of the choice may include:  (a) Similarity of emission sources with respect to technologies and measures applied,  or sectors covered by the methodology which may allow the use of an ambitious  benchmark covered under paragraph 36 (ii) of the RMP;  (b) Availability of data required for a conservative and reliable estimation of the  baseline. 41. For the approaches identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP, mechanism methodologies  shall contain provisions to apply the method detailed in section 4.7 below to adjust the  baseline emissions downwards and to ensure consistency with paragraph 33 of the RMP. 42. A host Party may determine a more ambitious baseline requirement at its discretion and  specify it to the Supervisory Body for approval.  7 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 4.7. Addressing elements of paragraph 33 and paragraph 36 of the RMP 43. Mechanism methodologies shall address consistency of implementation of paragraph 36  of the RMP with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP through the appropriate  application of:  (a) Downward adjustment to the baseline as per paragraph 36 (iii) of the RMP; and/or  (b) Downward adjustment to the baseline resulting from or applied to the approaches  in paragraph 36 (i) and (ii) of the RMP, unless otherwise decided by the  Supervisory Body. 44. If the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above demonstrates a downward adjustment  that is greater than the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, no further  adjustment is required. Where the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above is less than  the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, further adjustment is required  to align with the result of paragraphs 45 to 47 below to ensure consistency with the  requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP. 45. Factors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment of baselines shall be included  in the project design document and updated at each renewal of the crediting period, in  accordance with paragraphs 46 to 47 below. Host Parties may decide to apply more  stringent factors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment, according to their  circumstances. 46. The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers economic  viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization  technologies, negative emission approaches while ensuring that methodologies are  aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. 47. The downward adjustment to the baseline referred to above may be operationalized  through:  (a) Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies approved  by the Supervisory Body. These may be developed by all participants covered in  decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 35. Activity participants or stakeholders may propose  factors or quantitative methods for the consideration of the Supervisory Body in  consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being involved. If  a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the procedures  for the standardized baselines shall be applied;  (b) Development of factors or quantitative methods, jointly by the Supervisory Body  and the host Party, with the provision for the host Party to make a request to the  Supervisory Body to initiate the development of the factors or quantitative methods.  The procedures for the standardized baselines may be used for this purpose; or  (c) Development of factors or quantitative methods by the host Party that are specified  to the Supervisory Body for approval. The procedures for the standardized  baselines may be used for this purpose. 4.8. Encouraging broad participation 48. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) encourage  broad participation (…)”.  8 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 49. The Supervisory Body shall encourage development of methodologies covering a wide  range of emission reduction and removal activities with broad sectoral and geographic  coverage. 50. The Supervisory Body shall encourage participation of a broad range of stakeholders  during the methodology development process and the methodology application by  enabling informed consultation as described in the “Procedure: Development, revision and  clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. 51. Mechanism methodologies shall:  (a) Contain provisions that uphold stringency and encourage broad participation by  being accurate, simple, clear, and avoiding complexity such that a wide range of  activity participants and host Parties can apply the methodology requirements  irrespective of a Party’s scientific infrastructure, financial and national  circumstances;  (b) Contain provisions that take into account the context on the ground in host Parties,  particularly in least developed countries and small island developing States;  (c) Contain provisions that take into account the knowledge and practices of local  communities and Indigenous Peoples;  (d) Permit the use of multiple data sources to address data gaps, and the use of  conservative default values and/or use of benchmarked data from comparable  regions to the extent they can be applicable;  (e) Use simple language that is inclusive, gender-sensitive, and accessible to a wide  range of stakeholders, including local communities and Indigenous Peoples to the  extent possible. 4.9. Including data sources, accounting for uncertainty and monitoring  requirements 52. Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall include relevant  assumptions, parameters, data sources and key factors (…)”. 53. The Supervisory Body shall ensure that mechanism methodologies are transparent and  comprehensible with respect to included assumptions, parameters, data sources and key  factors. 54. Mechanism methodologies shall contain or reference provisions that require the  accounting of uncertainty associated with emission factors, activity data and other  estimation parameters applied in the calculation of emission reductions or removals  consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. 55. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions requiring a listing of data parameters  that need to be monitored throughout the crediting period. This may include the data that  are directly measured where necessary on a sample basis, and the data that are collected  from other sources such as official statistics, expert judgment, IPCC guidelines, and  scientific literature. In this regard, methodologies shall contain provisions on monitoring  plans related to the collection, open publication and storing of all relevant data needed to  estimate baseline, project and leakage emissions, including provisions related to quality  assurance and quality control.  9 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 4.10. Recognizing suppressed demand 56. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) recognize  suppressed demand (…)”. 57. Suppressed demand in the context of an Article 6.4 activity is a situation where services  provided to a population are insufficient to meet the basic human needs such as minimum  amount of electricity for lighting, heating or cooling due to barriers, including low income  or lack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting such  needs requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline scenarios. 58. The Supervisory Body will recognize suppressed demand under a situation where the  BAU cannot realistically provide the level of service required of the Article 6.4 activity by  considering that the baseline scenario is not set based on the historical and continuation  of the current condition, but rather based on an alternative that provides a level of service  comparable to that provided by the Article 6.4 activity. 59. The Supervisory Body shall recognize suppressed demand by including benchmarks and  default factors in specific methodologies that may not be below BAU. 4.11. Taking into account policies and measures and relevant circumstances 60. Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) take into  account (…) policies and measures, and relevant circumstances, including national,  regional or local, social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances (…)”. 61. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to take into account relevant  circumstances, including national, regional, or local, social, economic, environmental and  technological, based on robust data and verifiable information. In this regard, the type of  data and information that would be necessary to meet the above provisions shall be  specified in the methodologies, particularly with regard to eligibility conditions, setting the  baseline, and demonstrating additionality. 4.12. Standardized baselines 62. Paragraph 37 of the RMP states that “Standardized baselines may be developed by the  Supervisory Body at the request of the host Party or may be developed by the host Party  and approved by the Supervisory Body. Standardized baselines shall be established at  the highest possible level of aggregation in the relevant sector of the host Party and be  consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP.” 63. A standardized baseline is a baseline developed at the request of or by a host Party or a  group of host Parties on a subnational, national, or group-of-Parties basis rather than on  an activity basis to facilitate the determination of the baseline, calculation of the GHG  emission reductions or removals and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4  activities, while ensuring environmental integrity within the scope of the standardized  baseline. 64. The application of standardized baselines is not mandatory unless explicitly stated in an  approved standardized baseline or in another standard approved by the Supervisory  Body. When the application of a standardized baseline is not mandatory, activity  participants may establish additionality or baseline emissions for their activity using other  approved approaches as an alternative to applying a standardized baseline.  10 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 65. A host Party may specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory  requirement for the activities implemented in the host Party. The Supervisory Body may  also specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory requirement for  certain cases such as when the standardized baseline is being used to address leakage  emissions of an activity, as further detailed in section 6 below. The provisions in this  paragraph may also apply to standardized baselines developed by or for a group of host  Parties. 66. The approaches for setting the baselines referred to in section 4.6 above shall also be  applied for the development of standardized baselines. 67. The host Party and the Supervisory Body should determine the level of aggregation taking  into account the following:  (a) A default level of aggregation shall comprise the facilities or equipment producing  a similar type of output within the geographical boundaries of one Party or a  specific subregion determined by the Party. The level of aggregation may be  expanded to a group of Parties with similar circumstances relating to the output;  (b) A default group of facilities should be disaggregated when significant dissimilarities  exist in the performance of facilities or groups of facilities in the country/region. In  this case, the disaggregation shall be carried out according to relevant criteria,  such as scale of production, installed capacity or age of the facilities. Standardized  baseline values should be determined for each group of similar facilities in this  case;  (a) Disaggregation should not result in standardized baselines with overlapping  applicability. 68. Standardized baselines shall include a default validity period of three years, starting from  the date of approval by the Supervisory Body. A host Party may propose a shorter or  longer validity period, taking into account the specificity of sectors in which activities are  undertaken, and by providing justification for the consideration of the Supervisory Body. 69. After the validity of a standardized baseline has expired, the updated standardized  baseline can be submitted by the host Party for the consideration of the Supervisory Body  for approval. An updated standardized baseline shall not impact registered activities  applying the previous version up to the end of their current crediting period. 70. Standardized baselines may be developed by the host Party and approved by the  Supervisory Body following an assessment against the “Procedure: Development,  revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. 5. Additionality demonstration 71. Paragraph 38 of the RMP states that “Each mechanism methodology shall specify the  approach to demonstrating the additionality of the activity. Additionality shall be  demonstrated using a robust assessment that shows the activity would not have occurred  in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism, taking into account all relevant  national policies, including legislation, and representing mitigation that exceeds any  mitigation that is required by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that  avoids locking in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices  incompatible with paragraph 33 of the RMP”.  11 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 72. Paragraph 39 of the RMP states that “The Supervisory Body may apply simplified  approaches for demonstration of additionality for any least developed country or small  island developing State at the request of that Party, in accordance with requirements  developed by the Supervisory Body”. 73. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to demonstrate additionality through;  prior consideration of the benefits of the mechanism, regulatory analysis, the avoidance  of lock-in as well as through financial additionality complemented with a common practice  analysis. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in  paragraph 77 below. 74. Demonstration of the consideration of the benefits from the Article 6.4 mechanism as  necessary in the decision to implement the activity shall be performed in accordance with  the Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects. 75. Regulatory analysis shall require demonstration that the proposed activity represents  mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or regulation unless the law  or regulation refers to or formally integrates the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity that may require a  certain technological, performance or management action shall be considered, noting that  regulatory environments vary. 76. Avoidance of lock-in shall require demonstration that the proposed activity avoids locking  in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with  paragraph 33 of the RMP, including through an assessment of the scale, lifetime, and  emissions intensity of the activity; 77. Financial additionality can be proved either by:  (a) Demonstration that the proposed activity would not have occurred in the absence  of the incentives from the mechanism through an investment analysis (default  approach); or  (b) Assessment of barriers to the implementation of the activity, such as financial and  institutional barriers, first of its kind, taking into account all relevant national  policies, including legislation and current practices within the activity sector and  geographic area including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws.  To demonstrate additionality for their activity, through barrier analysis, activity  participants shall:  (i) Describe the barriers, including the reasons why investment analysis is not  sufficient; and  (ii) Evidence the barriers and how the mechanism will help overcome the  barriers.  (c) A common practice analysis to complement the investment and barrier analysis by  demonstrating that the measure or technology is not already widespread through  an analysis of the extent to which the proposed project type (e.g. technology or  practice) has already diffused in the relevant sector and region. 78. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in paragraph  77 above, subject to applicability conditions. The use of such approaches by an activity  shall require demonstration of the following, inter alia:  (a) the use of baseline approach(es) in paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) of the RMPs;  12 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1  (b) that the technologies or practices applied in the activity outperform an ambitious  threshold for emissions or emissions reductions, market penetration, or other  unique characteristics, set at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the  RMPs. 79. When formulating an approach to demonstrate the additionality, the Supervisory Body  shall take into account any communication from the host Party regarding paragraph 80  below. 80. When formulating an approach to the demonstration of additionality, including for  paragraph 76 above, mechanism methodologies should consider the relevant  circumstances, including national, regional or local, social, economic, environmental and  technological circumstances, in line with paragraphs 60 and 61 above, including Party-led  identification of activities that may be transformative. 6. Leakage 81. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) avoid leakage,  where applicable (…)”. 82. Leakage refers to anthropogenic emissions by sources of GHGs that occur outside the  activity boundary which are attributable to the Article 6.4 activity. 83. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to:  (a) Ensure that the potential sources of leakage in activities covered by a mechanism  methodology are identified, including, but not limited to, any sources referred to in  paragraph 84 below;  (b) Require activities to avoid or minimize all sources of leakage by applying the  appropriate approach(es) referred to in paragraph 85 below, including addressing  any remaining leakage by discounting credited volumes as described in paragraph  85(a) below;  (c) Require that activity participants list all potential sources of leakage that may  reasonably be attributable to the activity and describe how each is being  addressed. If the activity participant excludes any source of leakage from  consideration, they shall justify its exclusion;  (d) Include provisions for robust, transparent and user-friendly measurement,  reporting and independent third-party verification systems that encompass specific  sources of potential leakage identified;  (e) Include, where necessary, life cycle analysis of products or material in relation to  the source indicated in paragraph 84(d) below;  (f) Require the activity participant to take into account relevant information from the  DNA of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of  the tool developed by the Supervisory Body. 84. Leakage may occur due to, inter alia:  (a) Continued use of baseline equipment being transferred beyond the activity  boundary;  13 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1  (b) Use of resources that have competing uses from activities outside the activity  boundary that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary or shifts of  pre-project activities that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary;  (c) Diversion of existing production processes or services accounted for in the  baseline, inter alia through relocation and continuation of baseline activities outside  the activity boundary;  (d) Impacts on upstream and downstream processes associated with the materials  and services used by the activity, and/or products or services provided by the  activity, relative to the baseline, unless they are accounted as activity emissions. 85. Leakage shall be avoided and, where not possible, minimized, or addressed, by, inter alia:  (a) Discounting credited volumes: deducting emission reductions from credited  volumes taking into account equipment lifetime, where applicable;  (b) Scrapping of baseline equipment: undertaking and evidencing the  destruction/decommissioning/disposal of baseline equipment;  (c) Application of higher-level elements: applying a standardized baseline at a  higher level of aggregation (or equivalent) that is regularly updated and any  associated higher-level monitoring information and/or system;  (d) Nesting: Aligning relevant aspects of activity design and implementing activities  together with an existing higher-level crediting programme;  (e) Upscaling implementation: implementing activities at a higher level (e.g.  sectoral, subnational, or national). 86. For some types of activities, monitoring and use of a standardized baseline (or equivalent)  at national scale or jurisdictional level is necessary to quantify and account for leakage. 87. For those activities falling under the scope of Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Paris  Agreement, mechanism methodologies shall require, in addition to all relevant  requirements adopted by the Supervisory Body3, demonstration that the activity is included  in all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, noting  this is consistent with the application of the approaches described in paragraph 85 (c) and  (e). 7. Non-permanence and reversals 88. Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) address  reversals, where applicable”. 89. Mechanism methodologies shall address reversals of removals and emission reductions  using an approach consistent with the standard on requirements for activities involving  removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism.  ----- 3  See also document Article 6.4 activity standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-002) available at  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf.  14 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1  Document information Version Date Description 01.1 26 February 2025 Editorial revision to correct formatting and a cross reference in  paragraph 80. 01.0 9 October 2024 SBM 014, Annex 5.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), by its decision 3/CMA.3 “Rules, modalities and procedures for the  mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”, paragraph  6(c), requested the Supervisory Body of the mechanism established by Article 6,  paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to elaborate and further  develop, on the basis of the rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism  (RMP), recommendations on activities involving removals, including appropriate  monitoring, reporting, accounting for removals and crediting periods, addressing  reversals, avoidance of leakage, and avoidance of other negative environmental and  social impacts, in addition to the activities referred to in chapter V of the RMP (Article 6,  paragraph 4, activity cycle), to be considered at its fourth session (November 2022). 1 2. In response to this request, the Supervisory Body agreed on the recommendations on  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in the annex to  the addendum of its annual report to the CMA at its fourth session2. 3. The CMA, by its decision 7/CMA.4, paragraphs 19 and 20, invited Parties and admitted  observer organizations to submit, via the submission portal, by 15 March 2023, their views  on activities involving removals and requested the Supervisory Body to consider the views  of Parties and observers in elaborating and further developing recommendations on  activities involving removals, while taking into account the mandate provided to the  Supervisory Body contained in paragraph 24(a)(ix) of the RMP, and considering broader  inputs from stakeholders provided in a structured public consultation process. 4. Based on the request of the CMA in its decisions 3/CMA.3 and 7/CMA.4 and considering  views of Parties and observers as well as inputs from stakeholders, the Supervisory Body  agreed on the updated recommendation to the CMA as contained in the addendum of its  annual report to the CMA at its fifth session.3 5. The CMA, at its fifth session, requested the Supervisory Body to continue the relevant  work to operationalize the mechanism with a view to elaborating and further developing  recommendations for consideration and adoption at CMA 6. 1  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/460950. 2  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/621980. 3  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/632332.  3 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 1.2. Objectives 6. The objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for activities involving removals  under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. Entry into force 7. This version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024. 3. Context of removals under this standard 3.1. Context 8. Relevant extracts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth  Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (WGIII) definitions of activities involving  removals include the following:  (a) Anthropogenic removals as the withdrawal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the  atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. (IPCC AR6 WGIII report,  glossary);  (b) Carbon dioxide removal (CO2; CDR) as anthropogenic activities removing CO2  from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean  reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic  enhancement of biological, geochemical or chemical CO2 sinks, but excludes  natural CO2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. (IPCC AR-6 WG III  report, technical summary). 3.2. Definitions 9. For this document,  (a) Removals are the outcomes of processes by which greenhouse gases are  removed from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities and are  either destroyed or durably stored through anthropogenic activities;  (b) Activities involving removals meet the requirements referred to in paragraph 10.  Any examples in this standard relating to specific activity types or categories are  for illustrative purposes only and do not have the force of decisions by the  Supervisory Body regarding their use under the Article 6.4 mechanism, unless  explicitly so stated;  (c) Removals eligible for crediting are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for  removals;  (d) Reversals are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for removals;  (e) Avoidable reversals are reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have influence or control;  (f) Unavoidable reversals are reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have no influence or control.  4 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 4. Requirements 10. Activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the  Article 6.4 mechanism shall meet the requirements contained in the following sections, all  the applicable standards and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism and any further  requirements approved by the Supervisory Body in this regard. 4.1. Monitoring 11. Activity participants shall4 ensure that monitoring of removals is carried out based on data  derived from measurements, sampling, remote sensing, third party sources and published  literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and take appropriate  account of the associated uncertainties. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that specify the monitoring approaches  for all parameters necessary to calculate removals according to the types of removal  activities. 13. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the net removals are calculated in a  conservative manner, taking due account of the associated uncertainties. 14. To allow for flexibility in monitoring, default values may be used in the calculation of  removals provided that the use of the default values results in a conservative estimate of  net removals, taking due account of the associated uncertainties. 15. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for appropriate quality assurance and  quality control measures, such as cross-checking of monitoring results with other data  sources and published literature, or calibration of measuring equipment at regular  intervals. 16. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for monitoring and mitigating any risks  identified in section 4.6.1 Reversal risk assessment, and any risks identified in the  Sustainable development tool of the Article 6.4 mechanism, including through the free,  prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples directly or indirectly affected by the  activity. 17. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions requiring the activity participants to  submit a monitoring plan as part of the project design document submitted with the request  for registration. The monitoring plan shall be reviewed and updated at the beginning of  each renewed crediting period and in any of the following circumstances:  (a) The designated operational entity (DOE) or the Supervisory Body identifies the  need to revise the monitoring plan based on any concerns identified with the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;  (b) Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are  not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan; 4  For normative references, refer to section Normative reference of the Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies.  5 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  (c) The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk  factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring  plan and the risk assessment plan. 4.2. Reporting 18. Activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report after implementing the monitoring  activities specified in the monitoring plan. 19. Monitoring reports shall be based on the monitoring plan contained in the registered  activity design document and shall include:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated net removals occurring during the monitoring period, together with  the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;  (d) Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could  have led to the reversal of removals along with a summary of the GHG release  notifications referred to in paragraph 43 that were submitted during the period  covered by the monitoring report;  (e) Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent  with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered project design  document;  (f) Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been  assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the  registered project design document. 20. Monitoring reports shall be prepared without a gap between the two consecutive  monitoring periods, which may be of equal or different duration. 21. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the frequency of submission of the monitoring  reports, based on the nature, the type and the risk of reversals associated with the activity  involving removals identified through the application of necessary standards and tools.  The specified frequency shall include the following elements:  (a) The maximum permissible interval between the start date of the first crediting  period and the submission of the first monitoring report shall be between one and  five years;  (b) The maximum permissible interval between the submission of two consecutive  monitoring reports after the first monitoring report shall be between one and five  years. 22. The activity participants may choose a shorter time period than the time period specified  in paragraph 21. 23. In addition to the monitoring reports referred to in paragraph 21, a monitoring report shall  also be submitted following the observation of an event of GHG release that could  potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in paragraph 47.  6 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 24. The activity participants may request the Supervisory Body, providing a transparent and  verifiable justification, to extend the due date for submission of a monitoring report beyond  the due date determined in accordance with paragraphs 21 to 23. The Supervisory Body  shall consider the request for the extension of the due date and shall either grant or refuse  such an extension. 25. If the activity participants fail to submit a monitoring report by the due date determined in  accordance with paragraphs 21 to 24, the operations of issuance, transfer, and  cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity for which the monitoring report was due  shall be suspended, and there may be other consequences as determined by the  Supervisory Body in its guidance on and procedures for addressing late, incomplete, or  missing monitoring report submissions. 4.3. Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting 26. Monitoring shall continue after the end of the last active crediting period of the activity to  assess whether any reversals have occurred, quantify the amount of reversals and confirm  the continued storage of the GHGs. 27. No A6.4ERs shall be issued for the net removals occurring during the post-crediting  monitoring period. 28. The activity participants may request the Supervisory Body to allow termination of the  post-crediting monitoring if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable  information, that:  (a) The stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or  (b) The potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of  section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals. 4.4. Accounting for removals 29. Accounting for removals shall be undertaken in a consistent unit of measurement. 30. Removals eligible for crediting shall be determined as follows:  (a) The net change in greenhouse gas storage shall be calculated by subtracting the  sum of the change in greenhouse gas stored in each applicable greenhouse gas  reservoir in the baseline scenario from the sum of the change in greenhouse gas  stored in each applicable greenhouse gas reservoir in the activity scenario,  calculated from the start date of the period covered by a monitoring report to the  end date of the same period;  (b) The net change in emissions, not including any greenhouse gas storage losses  from the greenhouse gas reservoirs referred to in paragraph (a), shall be calculated  by subtracting the total emissions in the baseline scenario from the total emissions in the  activity scenario, calculated from the start date of the period covered by a  monitoring report to the end date of the same period;  (c) If the net change in greenhouse gas storage is positive, then the number of  A6.4ERs issued to the activity is calculated by combining the following terms  (herein referred to as net removals):  (i) The net change in greenhouse gas storage, specified in paragraph (a);  7 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  (ii) Minus (-) the net change in emissions, specified in paragraph (b);  (iii) Minus (-) any applicable leakage effects;  (iv) Minus (-) any crediting deficit, specified in paragraph (d);  (d) If the calculation in paragraph (c) is negative, then no A6.4ERs shall be issued for  the period covered by that monitoring report and the negative number shall be  recorded as a crediting deficit and included in future A6.4ER issuance calculations;  (e) If the net change in greenhouse gas storage is negative, then there is a reversal  of an equivalent quantity (herein referred to as reversals). 31. Only the positive net changes in GHG storage referred to in paragraph 30 that are directly  anthropogenic shall be eligible for crediting. 32. A carbon pool, a GHG reservoir or a greenhouse gas may be optionally excluded from  accounting if it is demonstrated, through transparent and verifiable information, that such  exclusion results in a more conservative calculation of the net removals. 33. The calculation referred to in paragraph 30 shall be carried out for each year of the post-  crediting monitoring period. 34. Where an activity involving removals also results in emission reductions, the accounting  of removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the monitoring report in  accordance with the methodology applicable to the activity. 4.5. Methodologies applicable for a renewed crediting period 35. At the renewal of the crediting period, the activity participants shall apply the latest version  of the applicable methodology. 4.6. Addressing reversals 36. The activity participants shall prevent and minimize the risk of reversals. The reversal of  removals in respect of which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated in  accordance with the provisions of section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals. 4.6.1. Reversal risk assessment 37. The risks of reversals may be related to, inter alia:  (a) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, rising opportunity costs;  (b) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,  acts of terrorism, crime, and war;  (c) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, and droughts,  hurricanes, floods, and landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, geological  faults, and fractures;  (d) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. 38. Activity participants shall conduct a risk assessment, which shall include a risk mitigation  plan, for an activity involving removals, using the reversal risk assessment tool to identify,  assess and mitigate reversal risks, and calculate an overall percentage-based risk rating  8 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  (hereinafter referred to as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable  reversals, taking into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood, and duration of  the risks. 39. The percentage-based risk rating calculated in paragraph 38 above shall inform:  (a) The proportion of A6.4ERs to be transferred to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account;  (b) Identification of A6.4ERs with a negligible risk of reversal which shall be tagged in  the mechanism registry. 40. The risk assessment and the related information referred to in paragraphs 37 and 38  above shall form part of the project design document submitted with the request for  registration. 41. Activity participants shall review and revise the risk assessment every five years from the  start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances referred to in  paragraph 17. 42. The risk assessment and related reporting shall in addition to the above follow any further  guidance to be developed on risk rating and any upper limits to the risk rating. 4.6.2. Reversal-related notifications and actions 43. The activity participants shall notify the Supervisory Body of any observed event involving  the release of stored GHGs that could potentially lead to a reversal (hereinafter referred  to as “the observed event”) within 30 days of becoming aware of the event. The  notification, which may be in digital form, shall include a brief description of the event,  including the date or the dates of its occurrence and its location. 44. Upon the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 43, the Supervisory Body shall  instruct the mechanism registry administrator to suspend the operations of issuance,  transfer, and cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity involving removals. 45. The activity participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report, containing  information referred to in paragraphs 19(a)-(c) in order to determine whether the observed  event has resulted in an actual reversal. If the observed event is an ongoing event, the  preliminary assessment report shall be prepared after the event has ended or has been  fully contained. 46. If the preliminary assessment report referred to in paragraph 45 concludes, on the basis  of transparent and verifiable evidence, that the observed event did not result in an actual  reversal, the report shall be verified by the DOE and submitted to the Supervisory Body  within 90 days of the end of the observed event. If the Supervisory Body approves the  preliminary assessment report, it shall notify the activity participants of such approval and  shall instruct the mechanism registry administrator to resume the suspended registry  operations referred to in paragraph 44. 47. If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the  preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual  reversal, the activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report in accordance with  9 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  paragraph 19 and, after its verification by the DOE, shall submit the monitoring report to  the Supervisory Body within 365 days of the end of the observed event. 48. Upon receipt of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the Supervisory Body  shall assess the monitoring report and determine whether the report accurately estimates  the magnitude of the reversal and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable,  and, based on that determination, proceed to take the actions described in section 4.6.3  Remediation of reversals. 49. Following the submission of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the activity  participants shall review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk  rating of the activity as necessary. This shall result in increased contribution to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account if there is an increase in the risk rating and require the  development of plans to prevent further releases of GHGs. 50. The activity participants shall also review the compliance with the requirements and  safeguards contained in the Sustainable development tool, taking into account any  negative environmental and social impacts caused by the reversal and developing plans  to prevent the recurrence of such negative environmental and social impacts. 51. The activity participants shall remain responsible for the implementation of the activity,  including carrying out the processes, actions and measures required by this section. 4.6.3. Remediation of reversals 52. Reversals of removals for which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated by  taking measures described in this section and any other further relevant guidance from  the Supervisory Body. The measures are intended to effectively address reversals and  maintain incentives for activity participants to proactively mitigate reversal risks and avoid  reversals. 4.6.3.1. Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account operations and contributions 53. The Supervisory Body shall establish a Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account in the  mechanism registry which serves to remediate avoidable and unavoidable reversals in full  through cancellation of an equivalent amount and authorization status (authorized A6.4ER  or Mitigation Contribution Unit) of Buffer A6.4ERs. The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account  shall aggregate all contributions of Buffer A6.4ERs. 54. The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account shall be administered and shall only be accessed  by the Article 6.4 mechanism registry administrator. The composition of the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, including the share of A6.4ERs by vintage, region and country, type  of activity, authorization status, risk rating, and methodology, shall be published annually. 55. Upon issuance of all A6.4ERs, an amount of A6.4ERs proportionate to the issuing  activity’s risk rating for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals shall be forwarded to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. A6.4ERs forwarded to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account shall become Buffer A6.4ERs. Buffer A6.4ERs shall only be cancelled and shall  not be further transferred. 56. Following a reversal event and the Supervisory Body’s review of a full monitoring report  that reflects reversals, the Supervisory Body will immediately notify the mechanism  registry administrator of the results of its review and the amount and type of Buffer  A6.4ERs required for remediation.  10 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 57. The mechanism registry administrator shall immediately notify the activity participants,  effect the cancellation of Buffer A6.4ERs equal to the amount of reversals, and shall  indicate the purpose of cancellation for remediation of reversals in the mechanism registry. 58. For avoidable reversals, for which A6.4ERs have been cancelled from the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, activity participants shall be fully liable for replenishing the Reversal  Risk Buffer Pool Account by forwarding the equivalent amount and type (authorized  A6.4ER or Mitigation Contribution Unit) of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account within a timeframe to be specified by the Supervisory Body. 59. Activity participants should obtain and maintain sufficient coverage under an insurance  policy or comparable guarantee products to cover the risk that avoidable reversals occur. 60. The Supervisory Body shall oversee a regular stress-test of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account to assess the resilience of the pool to a range of reversal risk scenarios and to  consider and implement any potential remedial actions necessary to manage risks to the  robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. 61. The stress-test shall assess the resilience of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account to a  range of reversal risk scenarios based on, inter alia, the range of risk ratings as well as  significant loss event(s), affecting the activities linked to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account. The stress-test shall occur at least every three years and in an event of a  significant loss event. 62. The Supervisory Body will consider and implement any potential remedial actions  necessary to manage risks to the robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account,  including ongoing consideration of measures to remediate reversals and ensure the  resilience, sufficiency, and solvency of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, and other  appropriate measures and procedures that may provide suitable alternative means to  remediate reversals, including the following:  (a) Requirements and approval procedures for the use of insurance policies, or  comparable guarantee products, or third-party guarantee approved by the  Supervisory Body to cover the risk that reversals occur;  (b) Procedures for establishing, managing, and using a monetary permanence reserve  enabling remediation of reversals through the direct or potentially centralized  purchase and cancellation of A6.4ERs with negligible or no reversal risk. 4.6.3.2. Avoidable versus unavoidable reversals 63. Mechanism methodologies shall, in addition to the above, follow further guidance  developed by the Supervisory Body on avoidable and unavoidable reversals. 4.7. Avoidance of leakage 64. The activity participants shall address the risk of leakage and account for any residual  leakage in calculation of net removals in accordance with the requirements set out in  “Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the  development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”, The  methodologies and associated tools may include additional requirements for specific types  of removal activities.  11 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 4.8. Avoidance of other negative environmental and social impacts and  respecting human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples 65. The activity participants shall apply robust social and environmental safeguards to  minimize and, where possible, avoid negative environmental and social impacts of the  activity in accordance with the requirements contained in:  (a) Article 6.4 sustainable development tool5;  (b) Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard6;  (c) Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for projects 7 , including the  provisions for local and global stakeholder consultation contained therein;  (d) Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism8;  (e) Any other relevant provisions developed by the Supervisory Body in this regard.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 9 October 2024 SBM 014, Annex 6.

Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This standard sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to  demonstrating additionality. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies  in developing methodologies and by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Methodological Expert  Panel (MEP) and the Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism  methodologies for approval. The standard is not intended for the preparation of project  design documents (PDDs) or monitoring reports. 2. Requirements relating to demonstrating the consideration of the benefits from the  Article 6.4 mechanism as necessary in the decision to implement the activity are not  addressed in this standard. They are addressed in the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity  standard for projects”, the Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of  activities”, the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”, and the  “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. 1.2. Entry into force 3. The date of entry into force is the date of the publication of the SBM 015 meeting report  on 14 February 2025. 2. Definitions 4. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Activity participant: a public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4  project;  (b) Additionality: An Article 6.4 activity is additional if:  (i) It represents mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or  regulation (see section 5.1 below).  (ii) It avoids locking in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon intensive  practices that are incompatible with paragraph 33 of the rules, modalities and  procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism for the mechanism (see section 6.2  below); and  (iii) It would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the  mechanism, taking into account all relevant national policies, including  legislation (see section 6.3 below).  (c) Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent  agreements1, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding  mandates. 1 For example, agreements between parties, such as between a private sector entity and a government,  to take an action in exchange for avoiding court action.  3 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 3. Applicability 5. This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for  activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to  also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g. programmes  of activities, policies, sectoral approaches, etc). 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions  and net removals. 7. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For  simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. 4. General principles and requirements 4.1. Principles 8. The following principles shall be applied in demonstrating additionality to ensure that  information provided is a true and fair account. These principles shall be the basis for and  guide the development of mechanism methodologies:  (a) Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for the demonstration  of additionality shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters that  may have an impact on the outcome of assessment of additionality shall be included;  (b) Completeness: All relevant information to support the assessment of additionality  shall be provided;  (c) Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across similar  circumstances;  (d) Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative information  shall be reduced as far as is practical;  (e) Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow  intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency relates  to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied; referencing  background material; stating documentation changes and stating and justifying all  data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the outcomes can be  reproduced;  (f) Conservativeness: In the context of demonstrating additionality, a methodological  approach is conservative if the data, parameters, assumptions and methods chosen  are more likely to lead to conservativeness. 4.2. General requirements 9. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the approach to demonstrating the additionality  of an Article 6.4 activity. The approach shall ensure that an Article 6.4 activity would not  be implemented without the incentives from the mechanism and that the incentives from  the mechanism enable the implementation of the activity. 10. Mechanism methodologies may either use separate approaches to demonstrate  additionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both  4 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2  demonstrates additionality and determine the baseline scenario. Where a combined  approach is used, both this standard and the standard “Setting the baseline in mechanism  methodologies” shall apply. 11. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure conservativeness in the demonstration of  additionality. This shall apply to all data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used in  the analysis (e.g. operating expenditure used in conducting an investment analysis or data  on the market penetration of a technology). The degree of conservativeness shall be  based on the level of uncertainty (e.g. in a sensitivity analysis of the investment analysis  the selection of the parameters to be varied and the magnitude of variation shall be  informed by uncertainty). All sources of uncertainty shall be considered, including  uncertainty in data, parameters, assumptions, and methods. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the provisions to demonstrate additionality  consider all national or sub-national policies that are applicable to the relevant Article 6.4  activity and its alternatives. This shall include legal requirements, subsidies, taxes, fees  and relevant other incentives. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national  targets for the sector or the type of activity, as long as these are supported by policy  frameworks for implementation, but not general goals that are not specific to the sector or  type of activity. 13. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that additionality is demonstrated for an  Article 6.4 activity in its entirety (e.g. the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the  landfill gas for energy generation) and that additionality is not separately demonstrated for  different parts of an Article 6.4 activity (e.g. separately for the landfill gas capture and the  use of the landfill gas for energy generation). This provision does not apply if different  activities can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect each other (e.g. the  implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the catalytic abatement  of N2O emissions at a nitric acid production plant). 5. Approaches to demonstrate additionality 5.1. Overview of approaches to demonstrate additionality 14. This standard establishes requirements for the following approaches to demonstrate  additionality:  (a) Regulatory analysis: Regulatory analysis shall require demonstration that the proposed  activity represents mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or  regulation unless the law or regulation refers to or formally integrates the mechanism as  an instrument for implementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity  that may require a certain technological, performance or management action shall be  considered, noting that regulatory environments vary;  (b) Analysis of lock-in risk: Demonstration that the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity  does not lead to locking in levels of emissions or carbon-intensive technologies or  practices that are incompatible with paragraph 33 of the rules, modalities and procedures  of the Article 6.4 mechanism;  (c) Investment analysis: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity is not financially viable in  the absence of revenues from A6.4ERs;  5 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2  (d) Barrier analysis: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity would be prevented by  barriers and that the incentives from the mechanism make the determining difference for  overcoming the barriers;  (e) Common practice analysis: Demonstration that the relevant technology or practice is  not common practice (e.g. it has a low market penetration);  (f) Performance-based approach: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity is unlikely to be  implemented without the incentives from the mechanism if it outperforms other activities  in one or several indicator(s) (e.g. an emissions benchmark) that are a good proxy for the  likelihood of additionality for the relevant technology or practice. 5.2. Possible combinations of approaches 15. Figure 1 illustrates how mechanism methodologies may combine the approaches referred  to in section 5.1 Other combinations of approaches are not permitted.  6 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 Figure 1. Flowchart of the approaches to demonstrate additionality 16. Regulatory analysis and analysis of lock-in risk shall be addressed in all mechanism  methodologies. 17. The investment analysis shall be used as the default approach. Where mechanism  methodologies do not apply the investment analysis, the methodology proponents shall  appropriately explain and justify why an investment analysis is infeasible or inappropriate.  In this case, the methodology proponents shall nevertheless include information on the  financial viability of eligible Article 6.4 activities or require activity participants to provide  such information. 18. The barrier analysis may be used as an alternative to the investment analysis, subject to  the applicability conditions in section 6.4.1 and appropriate justification. 19. Where investment analysis or barrier analysis are used, this shall be complemented by a  common practice analysis. 20. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to the investment analysis,  barrier analysis and common practice analysis, subject to the applicability conditions in  section 6.6.1 and appropriate justification.  7 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 5.3. Application of the approaches at different levels 21. The approaches for demonstration of additionality, as referred to in section 5.1, may be  applied at different levels and by different entities, subject to the provisions in paragraph  22:  (a) Proponent of the mechanism methodology: The proponent of a mechanism  methodology may demonstrate that one or several of the approaches referred to  in section 5.1 are satisfied for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4 activities  that are eligible under the methodology. The methodology may specify applicability  criteria or conditions under which the approach is deemed to be satisfied for all, or  a subset of, the potential Article 6.4 activities (e.g. if activities are implemented in  a particular region and/or if the market penetration of the technology is below a  certain threshold in the relevant geographical region). The proponent of the  mechanism methodology shall provide documented evidence and justifications in  the methodology that the approach is satisfied for the relevant activities. The  mechanism methodology may then state that the approach is deemed to be  satisfied for the relevant activities, as long as the applicability criteria or conditions  specified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism methodology may need  to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis. The proponent of the  mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration of the validity of the  proposed methodology (e.g. three years);  (b) Activity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify  in the methodology a methodological procedure for one or several of the  approaches referred to in section 5.1. This procedure shall then be applied by each  proposed Article 6.4 activity. For example, a methodology may prescribe an  investment comparison analysis that must be applied by activity participants to  assess the financial attractiveness of a proposed Article 6.4 activity;  (c) Host countries: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify in the  methodology which approaches, parameters or conditions may or shall be  demonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host  countries.. 22. The approaches for demonstration of additionality, as referred to in section 5.1, shall be  applied as follows:  (a) Regulatory analysis shall be applied by activity participants, or by host countries  (through the submission of a standardized baseline).  (b) Analysis of lock-in risk should preferably be applied by the proponent of the  mechanism methodology but may also be applied by activity participants, or by  host countries (through the submission of a standardized baseline);  (c) Investment analysis and common practice analysis may be implemented at any of  the three levels referred to in paragraph 21;  (d) Barrier analysis should preferably be applied by the proponent of the mechanism  methodology, or by the host countries (through the submission of a standardized  baseline). Where it is proposed to be applied by activity participants, appropriate  explanation and justification shall be provided why demonstration by the proponent  of the mechanism methodology, or by the host country (through the submission of  a standardized baseline) is not appropriate.  8 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 23. Mechanism methodologies may apply different approaches for demonstrating additionality  at different levels. For example, a mechanism methodology could include a combination  of the following approaches: a regulatory analysis and an investment analysis to be  applied by the activity participants, combined with an analysis of lock-in risk and a common  practice analysis demonstrated by the proponent of the mechanism methodology. 6. Requirements for specific approaches 6.1. Regulatory analysis 24. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to demonstrate that the emission  reductions or net removals resulting from an Article 6.4 activity would not occur as a result  of any law or regulation, unless the law or regulation refers to or formally integrates the  mechanism as an instrument for implementation. A law or regulation2 applicable to the  proposed activity that may require a certain technological, performance or management  action shall be considered, noting that regulatory environments vary. 25. The analysis supporting this demonstration shall confirm that legal requirements, except  for those that refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation, do not:  a) Directly require the implementation of an activity;  b) Indirectly require the implementation of an activity, by requiring a certain technological,  performance or management action or by preventing potential alternative scenarios to  the implementation of the activity;  c) Establish a support scheme that:  (i) Is designed to achieve a quantitative target or outcome for the relevant  technologies or practices;  (i) Is applicable to the activity; and  (ii) Would likely result in the same amount of emission reductions or net  removals if the activity would not be implemented. 26. The analysis shall be based on credible and current evidence and be justified. 27. The mechanism methodology shall specify the appropriate frequency for updating the  analysis, taking into account the context of the type of activity, as follows:  (a) Where the analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in paragraph  21(b), the analysis shall be conducted at the latest at each renewal of the crediting  period;  (b) Where the analysis is applied through a standardized baseline, as referred to in  21(c), the mechanism methodology shall specify for how long the standardized  baseline may be valid (i.e. by when the standardized baseline would need to be  updated to confirm that the conclusion of the analysis is still valid). 2 A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 75.  9 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 6.2. Analysis of lock-in risk 28. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the analysis of lock-in risk follows a neutral  approach with regards to technology and source. 29. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that an Article 6.4 activity:  (a) Does not lead to the adoption or the prolongation of the lifetime of technologies or  practices that are incompatible with long term goals of the Paris Agreement, taking  into account different national circumstances, approaches and pathways;  (b) Is consistent with the host country’s long-term low-emission development strategy  (LT-LEDS), as referred to in Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement (where the host  country has submitted one);  (c) For technologies or practices with a long lifetime, relies on a technology or practice  that is among those within the lowest greenhouse gas intensity in the relevant  region taking into account the lifetime of the technology or practice in line with  national circumstances, approaches and pathways; and  (d) Does not involve a technology or practice that constitutes an inefficient use of a  resource that is important for mitigating climate change or achieving other policy  objectives. 30. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall either provide appropriate justification  that all Article 6.4 activities eligible under the mechanism methodology meet the above  requirements, as per paragraph 29(a), or include a methodological procedure that activity  participants or host countries shall apply to demonstrate the above requirements, as  referred to in paragraphs 29(b) and 29(c). 31. The analysis shall consider socio-economic contexts, existing infrastructure and any path  dependencies. The analysis shall also consider:  (a) The technical or operational lifetime of the technologies or practices established  as part of an Article 6.4 activity;  (b) The emissions intensity of these technologies and practices;  (c) The scale of the Article 6.4 activity and  (d) Availability and feasibility of alternative options given national circumstances. 32. Where the technologies or practices applicable under the mechanism methodologies have  a technical or operational lifetime of no more than 10 years, a mechanism methodology  may assume that no lock-in risk exists. Appropriate evidence and justification shall be  provided for the estimation of the technical or operational lifetime of the technology or  practice. Where this option is used, the validity of the methodology shall be limited to 31  December 2030 and the methodology shall be reviewed by the Supervisory Body prior to  its expiry.  10 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 33. The analysis shall be implemented in a conservative manner and be appropriately justified. 6.3. Investment analysis 6.3.1. Type of analyses 34. The following types of investment analyses may be used:  (a) Simple cost analysis: Demonstration that the implementation of an Article 6.4  activity is associated with costs and does not generate any cost savings or  revenues other than from A6.4ERs;  (b) Benchmark analysis: Comparison of the financial attractiveness of an Article 6.4  activity with a financial benchmark; or  (c) Investment comparison analysis: Comparison of the financial attractiveness of an  Article 6.4 activity with alternative options. 35. The type of analysis applied shall be suitable for the context of the type of Article 6.4  activities that are eligible under the methodology. For example, where the type of activity  can only be implemented by the activity participants and the activity participants face  different alternative investment options, the investment comparison analysis is most  suitable. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify the choice of analysis. 36. Where the analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in paragraph 21(b),  the mechanism methodology shall specify which of the analysis referred to in paragraph  34 shall be used by the activity participants. The mechanism methodology shall set out a  detailed procedure on how the analysis shall be conducted. 6.3.2. General requirements for conducting the investment analysis 37. The analysis shall include all relevant costs, including capital expenditure (CAPEX) and  operational expenditure (OPEX), including any barriers that can be monetized and  quantified as an additional cost, and all revenues and cost savings, including any public  funding such as subsidies, where applicable. 38. All parameters and assumptions used in the analysis shall be internally consistent. For  example, cash flows shall be expressed in either real or nominal terms consistently and  be determined consistent with the financial indicator used. The assumptions, data and  conclusions in the investment analysis shall be transparently documented, appropriately  justified and substantiated by evidence. 39. The analysis shall be implemented in a conservative manner. To ensure  conservativeness, the analysis shall include a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that the  conclusion of the analysis is robust to reasonable variations in the critical parameters and  assumptions, including CAPEX, OPEX, revenues and cost savings, as applicable. 40. The analysis of the financial viability of Article 6.4 activities without revenues from  A6.4ERs shall not include any transaction costs associated with generating A6.4ERs (e.g.  costs for preparing the PDD, validation and verification, fees to be paid to the UNFCCC). 41. Where the analysis is applied by the proponent of a mechanism methodology, or by the  host country (through the submission of a standardized baseline), as referred to in  paragraph 21(c) above, the analysis shall demonstrate that it is very likely that Article 6.4  activities that are eligible under the methodology satisfy the investment analysis. The  11 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2  analysis shall be based on data and information that is representative for the Article 6.4  activities that are eligible under the methodology, reflecting any important variations  among activities, such as the geographical region, the size of activities, or variations in the  technology or practice. The analysis may be supported by information from the literature  or data from a sample of activities. The analysis shall be publicly disclosed with the  proposed mechanism methodology. 42. Where the analysis is applied by the activity participants, as referred to in paragraph 21(b)  above, the following applies:  (a) The analysis shall be based on data and information applicable to the proposed  Article 6.4 activity, except otherwise specified in this standard;  (b) The analysis shall be based on data and information that is consistent with  information presented to the entity’s decision-making management and  investors/lenders at the start date of the Article 6.4 activity, as defined in the  “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects”. Where the project design  document (PDD) is submitted for validation prior to the start date of the Article 6.4  activity, the analysis shall be updated through the submission of a request for  approval of post-registration changes in accordance with the procedure “Article 6.4  activity cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002) or as part of at the first  verification of emission reductions or net removals, based on data and information  that was available at the start date;  (c) Where public funding for an Article 6.4 activity, expressed in grant equivalents, is  larger than the expected revenues from A6.4ERs, mechanism methodologies shall  require demonstration that public funding would not have filled the funding gap in  the absence of revenues from A6.4ERs. This may, for example, apply to public  funding schemes that are designed to pay for the funding gap of mitigation  activities;  (d) For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs  as part of the PDD or monitoring reports. 6.3.3. Requirements applicable to simple cost analysis 43. The simple cost analysis shall demonstrate that the implementation of an Article 6.4  activity is associated with costs and does not generate any cost savings or revenues other  than from A6.4ERs. 6.3.4. Requirements applicable to benchmark analysis and investment comparison  analysis 44. A suitable financial indicator for the financial viability of an Article 6.4 activity shall be used,  such as the net present value or internal rate of return. 45. The period of assessment shall reflect the period of expected operation of the underlying  technology or practice and include the residual value of the assets at the end of the  assessment period. Other periods and approaches may be proposed by proponents of  mechanism methodologies with appropriate justification. 6.3.5. Requirements applicable to benchmark analysis 46. The financial benchmark shall be derived in a conservative manner.  12 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 47. Where the benchmark analysis is applied by the proponent of the mechanism  methodology, or a host country (through the submission of a standardized baseline), as  referred to in paragraphs 21(c) above, the financial benchmark shall be consistent with  the weighted average cost of capital (or the cost of equity, as applicable) that is commonly  applicable to the country, sector and type of activity. 48. Where the benchmark analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in 21(b),  the following applies:  (a) Where the Article 6.4 activity can only be implemented by the activity participants,  and not by any other entities, the financial benchmark shall be based on the  benchmark used by the entity implementing the Article 6.4 activity. This may apply,  for example, to modifications to an existing plant;  (b) Where the Article 6.4 activity could also be implemented by other entities, the  financial benchmark shall be based on the more conservative value between (i)  the benchmark used by the entity implementing the Article 6.4 activity and (ii) the  weighted average cost of capital (or the cost of equity, as applicable) that is  commonly applicable to the country, sector and type of activity. This may apply, for  example, to the installation of greenfield plants. 49. An Article 6.4 activity shall only be considered additional if the analysis demonstrates that  the Article 6.4 activity would not be financially viable, based on credible data and input  parameters to the investment analysis. 6.3.6. Requirements applicable to investment comparison analysis 50. In most sectors, the alternative scenarios considered shall provide the same type and level  of products or service as the Article 6.4 activity. This requirement does not apply to some  land-use activities, such as afforestation or avoided deforestation, where there could be a  change in the type of service between the scenario with the Article 6.4 activity and the  baselines scenario. 51. An Article 6.4 activity shall only be considered additional if the analysis demonstrates that  the activity would not be financially viable, based on credible data parameters to the  investment analysis. 6.4. Barrier analysis 6.4.1. Applicability 52. The barrier analysis may be applied for Article 6.4 activities that are:  (a) Implemented at individual households (e.g. distribution of efficient cookstoves); or  (b) Undertaken by small public or private entities that typically do not have access to  commercial or public third-party finance . 53. Other cases for the application of the barrier analysis may be proposed by mechanism  methodology proponents with due justification and demonstration that such barriers are  prohibitive, including examples of relevant barriers. 6.4.2. Requirements for conducting the barrier analysis 54. The following barriers may be considered:  13 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2  (a) Institutional barriers (e.g. the investor not being the beneficiary of cost savings  associated with the investment);  (b) Information barriers;  (c) Financial barriers (e.g. lack of access to loans by rural households);  (d) The activity is first-of-its kind (e.g. no other similar activities have been  implemented in the relevant geographical area). 55. Investment barriers (e.g. high interest rates for loans due to high perceived country risks)  and other relevant barriers shall be considered as part of an investment analysis. 56. The barrier analysis shall:  (a) Identify and describe relevant barriers faced by the Article 6.4 activity;  (b) Demonstrate that the barriers prevent the Article 6.4 activity from being  implemented without the incentives from the mechanism;  (c) Demonstrate that there are no other programs or incentives, such as subsidies,  that would incentivize the Article 6.4 activity;  (d) Demonstrate that the incentives from the mechanism are the determinant element  in overcoming the identified barriers;  (e) Demonstrate that at least one plausible alternative to the Article 6.4 activity does  not face significant barriers, including the barrier faced by the Article 6.4 activity. 57. The barrier analysis shall take into account:  (a) All relevant national and sub-national policies, including legislation;  (b) Current practices within the sector and geographic area;  (c) Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws, where applicable and  (d) Relevant national circumstances, approaches and pathways. 58. Barriers that are unique to a proposed Article 6.4 activity may only be used if the activity  can only be implemented by the activity participants. 59. The barrier analysis shall be supported by credible evidence. Such evidence may include  independent studies, publicly available surveys, relevant verifiable market data, or data  from national or international statistics but shall not include anecdotal evidence. The  evidence shall be interpreted in a conservative manner (i.e. that it is unlikely that the effect  of the barrier is overestimated). 6.5. Common practice analysis 60. Mechanism methodologies that use a common practice analysis shall include provisions  to demonstrate that Article 6.4 activities are not common practice. This shall include:  (a) An appropriate definition of a suitable indicator to assess common practice based  on the recent uptake or existing stock or diffusion of technologies, services or  practices in relation to a realistic maximum market size or potential, taking into  14 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2  account any constraints for the uptake of the relevant technology, service, or  practice;  (b) A definition of the appropriate geographical boundary for assessing common  practice for the type of technology, service or practice, taking into account relevant  market boundaries, where applicable; and  (c) The specification of an appropriately conservative threshold that may not be  surpassed for an Article 6.4 activity to be deemed additional. 6.6. Performance-based approaches 6.6.1. Applicability 61. A performance-based approach may be applied to types of Article 6.4 activities where all  of the following conditions are met:  (a) The mechanism methodology uses the baseline approach(es) referred to  paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) of the rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4  mechanism;  (b) The type of activity involves the production of a highly homogeneous product or  the provision of a highly standardized service (e.g. electricity);  (c) The performance of the type of activity can be defined through one or several  suitable indicator(s);  (d) Information is available to demonstrate that activities with a better performance in  respect to the indicator(s) have a higher likelihood of additionality;  (e) Data is available or can be collected on the performance of activities with respect  to the indicator(s), and the data is robust and representative. 62. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall demonstrate and justify that these  conditions are fulfilled. 6.6.2. Requirements for conducting performance-based approaches 63. Mechanism methodologies shall define one or several suitable indicators and thresholds  for the performance-based approach and specify the approach to the use or collection of  data. 6.6.2.1. Establishment of indicator(s) 64. The indicator(s) shall be a good proxy for the likelihood for additionality. This means that  activities with a better performance in respect to the indicator(s) shall have a demonstrably  higher likelihood of additionality. Indicator(s) may be based on different metrics such as  greenhouse gas emissions intensity, market penetration or other unique characteristics of  the type of activity. 65. Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and  appropriateness of the proposed indicator(s) for the context of the type of activity and  geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable. Where possible, the  correlation between the indicator(s) and the likelihood of additionality should be quantified.  15 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2 6.6.2.2. Establishment of threshold(s) 66. The threshold(s) shall be defined such that an Article 6.4 activity is only deemed additional  if the indicator(s) pass the threshold(s) (passing may mean being above or below the  threshold, depending on the type of indicator). 67. The threshold(s) shall be set ambitiously, by:  (a) Ensuring that an Article 6.4 activity is very likely (i.e. at least 90% probability) to be  additional; and  (b) Setting the threshold(s) at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the  rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 68. It shall be very unlikely (i.e. less than 10% probability) that the threshold(s) are exceeded  by an Article 6.4 activity due to other influencing factors that are unrelated to the Article 6.4  activity (e.g. interannual variations in climatic conditions). 69. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the duration of the validity of any threshold(s)  provided in the methodology (e.g. three years) and how threshold(s) will be updated. 70. Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and  appropriateness of the proposed threshold(s) for the context of the type of activity and  geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable. 6.6.2.3. Use and collection of data 71. The mechanism methodology shall specify the approach to data collection, or which  existing data shall be used. The data used by the mechanism methodology shall be:  (a) Representative, reliable, accurate, consistent and transparent;  (b) Recent, especially in dynamic technological environments;  (c) Sufficiently disaggregated, taking into account differences in relevant technologies,  geographical or climate conditions, and the political, economic and social  environment; and  (d) Verifiable. 72. Uncertainty in the outcome shall be quantified and addressed through conservative  approaches (e.g. uncertainty reductions). Where sampling is involved, the sampling  approach and any statistical analyses shall be described. 73. Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and  appropriateness of the approach towards using or collecting data in the context of the type  of activity and geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable. 6.6.2.4. Use of threshold(s) for determining baseline emissions 74. Where a threshold is defined as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output, it may also  be used for determining baseline emissions, as long as the requirements in the “Standard  for baseline setting” are fulfilled.  -----  16 of 17  A6.4-STAN-METH-003 Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies Version 01.2  Document information  Version Date Description  01.2 5 March 2025 Editorial correction to paragraph 14 (c).  01.1 26 February 2025 Editorial revision to remove technology specific examples and  correct cross referencing.  01.0 14 February 2025 SBM 015, Annex 11  Initial adoption.

Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This standard sets out requirements for mechanism methodologies for setting the crediting  baseline, including identifying the baseline scenario and determining baseline emissions  and/or removals, and provides requirements for the determination of standardized  baselines. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies in developing  methodologies and by the Secretariat, the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) and the  Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism methodologies for approval.  The standard is not intended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or  monitoring reports. 2. Additional requirements for mechanism methodologies beyond setting the baseline are  included in Appendix 1 to this document. 1.2. Entry into force 3. This document enters into force on 16 May 2025. 2. Definitions 4. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Activity participant: A public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4  activity;  (b) Applicability conditions: Conditions that specify contexts, configurations and  cases in which a mechanism methodology can be applied to a proposed Article 6.4  activity while ensuring environmental integrity;  (c) Baseline geographical reference area: The geographical area assessed for  setting the crediting baseline;  (d) Best available technology (BAT): The practice or technology in a given scope  (e.g. sector and baseline geographical area) that:  i. Provides a similar output as the Article 6.4 activity;  ii. Represents an economically feasible and environmentally sound course of  action;  iii. Is available in the baseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the  shelf, or via a tendering or direct contracting process, or by direct  implementation by an end user within the boundary of potential Article 6.4  activities; and  iv. Results in the lowest emissions or largest removals per unit of output  among all practices and/or technologies that fulfil the conditions (i) to (iii).  4 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (e) Best performing comparable activities: The activities that provide outputs within  a top segment of performance in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or  removals per unit of output, considering all activities that provide similar outputs in  a baseline geographical reference area;  (f) Business-as-usual (BAU): Plausible reference benchmark or scenario for GHG  emissions or removals prior to or in the absence of the implementation of the  proposed Article 6.4 activity. It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an  emissions or removals intensity;  (g) Crediting baseline: Reference emissions or removals level against which the  volume of emission reductions or net removals achieved by the Article 6.4 activity  is quantified;  (h) Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent  agreements, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding  mandates, noting that regulatory environments may vary;  (i) Level of aggregation: The extent to which consolidation of information from any  parts or units to form a collective whole is undertaken;  (j) Level of service: the quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an  Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;  (k) Output: Each good or service1 provided by the Article 6.4 activity and/or in the  baseline scenario, as specified in the mechanism methodology;  (l) Policies: All national or sub-national policies that are applicable to the relevant  activity and its alternatives, including: policies and legal requirements; subsidies  and incentives (e.g., incentives from carbon pricing schemes such as emission  trading schemes or from guarantees of origin); taxes and tax breaks; fees;  performance standards; or other specified instruments or means of  implementation. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national targets  for the sector or the type of activity, as long as these are supported by policy  frameworks for implementation, but not general goals (e.g., a national emissions  target) that are not specific to the sector or type of activity;  (m) Pool of users: For activities related to outputs, the pool of users consists of the  user(s) supplied with the outputs by the activity;  (n) Remaining lifetime: The period during which an equipment would continue  operating and/or a certain practice would remain in place without undergoing major  repair or overhaul as specified in the mechanism methodology, given limitations  such as technical lifetime, economic lifetime, legal requirements, policies, or any  other factor which would lead to the discontinuation of the use of the equipment  and/or practice;  (o) Sector: A segment of a national economy that delivers defined output(s) (e.g.  municipal waste management, household cooking energy, electricity, residential  cooling, freight transportation); 1 For example, electricity, cooking energy, municipal waste management, and so forth.  5 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (p) Standardized baseline: A standardization developed on a subnational, national,  or group-of-Parties basis rather than on activity-specific basis to facilitate the  determination of the baseline, calculation of GHG emission reductions or removals  and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 activities, while ensuring  environmental integrity within the scope of the standardized baseline.2 3. Applicability 5. This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for  activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to  also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes  of activities, policies, sectoral approaches, etc). The standard further applies for the  development of standardized baselines. 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions  and net removals. The standard may be amended in the future to incorporate further  considerations for activities involving removals. 7. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For  simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. 4. General principles and requirements 4.1. Principles 8. The following principles shall be applied in setting crediting baselines and standardized  baselines to ensure that information provided is a true and fair account. These principles  shall be the basis for and guide the development of mechanism methodologies and  standardized baselines:  (a) Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative  information shall be reduced as far as is practical;  (b) Below business as usual: The determined crediting baseline shall be below a  conservatively determined BAU emissions level;  (c) Completeness: All relevant information to support the baseline setting shall be  included;  (d) Conservativeness: In the context of baseline setting, conservativeness is the use  of data, parameters, assumptions, and methods to ensure that baseline emissions  are not overestimated, and baseline removals are not underestimated. Only  credible sources shall be used that are appropriate to the context of the type of  activity;  (e) Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across  similar circumstances; 2 Based on the definition provided in A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 63. Available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf  6 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (f) Encourage ambition over time: Crediting baselines shall decrease over time to  encourage ambition of activities;  (g) Real: The results of activities represent actual tonnes of GHG emission reductions  or net removals derived from credible methods for estimating mitigation outcomes;  (h) Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for setting the  crediting baseline shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters  that may have an impact on the outcome of setting the crediting baseline shall be  included;  (i) Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow  intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency  relates to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied;  referencing background material; stating documentation changes and stating and  justifying all data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the  outcomes can be reproduced. 4.2. General requirements 4.2.1. General requirements for quantification 9. Mechanism methodologies shall satisfy the general requirements for mechanism  methodologies included in Appendix 1 of this standard. 4.2.2. Description of the pre-activity scenario 10. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to describe the pre-activity  scenario in the PDD. The pre-activity scenario corresponds to the circumstances  immediately prior to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and shall be the existing  conditions at the site where the activity will be implemented; or the conditions in the  absence of policies that refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation or, for the case of distributed technologies for households, communities,  and/or small and medium enterprises, the existing conditions for providing the activity  output(s) in the baseline geographical reference area. 4.2.3. Data requirements for baseline setting and quantification 11. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the assumptions, parameters, data sources and  key factors used for determining the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline emissions  and/or removals and specify the related requirements with regard to data quality, vintage,  availability and credibility. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall require data to be sourced from the most appropriate  data source. This may include internal data of the activity participants or publicly available  information provided by third parties. Only credible sources shall be used that are  appropriate to the context of the type of activity. Relevant third-party data sources may  include IPCC publications, peer-reviewed scientific literature, test results following  accepted standards performed by accredited entities, reports/statistics published by  governments, multilateral entities, or industry or sector organizations, as applicable. 13. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants and developers of  standardized baselines to transparently list and describe the sources of data considered  7 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  and justify the vintage, relevance, accuracy, and conservativeness of the choices made.  The data used shall be referenced. In cases where values, approaches or data sources  are only applicable to specific scopes (e.g., geographic or sectoral scopes), the  mechanism methodologies or standardized baselines shall clearly describe the scope of  applicability of the respective values, approaches or data sources. 14. Mechanism methodologies shall determine the baseline scenario and the baseline  emissions and/or removals in a transparent manner. They shall also take into account the  uncertainty associated with setting the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline  emissions and/or removals, consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. The consideration  of uncertainty shall include all causes of uncertainty, including assumptions, equations or  models, parameters and measurements. The consideration of uncertainty may, however,  focus or be limited to those causes of uncertainty that are most relevant in the context of  the Article 6.4 activity (e.g., the uncertainty of minor baseline emission sources may not  need to be considered). In the process of quantification of uncertainties, expert judgment  may be used, among other approaches provided by relevant IPCC guidelines. 15. Different approaches may be pursued to address uncertainty. These may include  approaches that address overall uncertainty or approaches that address uncertainty  separately for the baseline scenario and the quantification of baseline emissions and/or  removals. For example, in the case of uncertainties in the selection of the baseline  scenario, the most conservative scenario may be selected among different plausible  scenarios; whereas, for determining the baseline emissions and/or removals the  uncertainty may be quantified using approaches such as formulas for error propagation. 4.2.4. Standardization 16. Standardization of baseline scenarios and crediting baselines in mechanism  methodologies is encouraged as this avoids the risk of selection bias in using project-  specific approaches, which could lead to overestimation of baseline emissions or  underestimation of baseline removals. Such standardization may be achieved by the  application of the BAT or ambitious benchmark approach to baseline setting or through  the use of default values. 4.2.5. Justification of methodological choices and assumptions 17. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify all methodological choices and  assumptions made in determining the baseline scenario and the crediting baseline,  including how the choices and assumptions ensure that the principles and requirements  in this section and the requirements in Appendix 1 are satisfied. 5. Approach to setting the crediting baseline 5.1. Summary of the step-wise approach to determining the crediting baseline 18. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the procedure for determining the crediting  baseline, in accordance with the step-wise approach in figure 1 and described below.  8 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 Figure 1. Procedure for determining the crediting baseline3  Step 1. Select one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36  of the RMPs and justify the choice (Section 5)  Step 2. Apply the selected approach (Section 6), prior to implementation of  a downward adjustment, including:  • Determination of the baseline scenario  • Quantification of the unadjusted baseline emissions and/or removals  Step 3. Apply the downward adjustment, unless exemptions apply  (Section 7), including  • Quantification of the downward adjustment  • Quantification of the resulting downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or  removals  Step 4. Identify a conservative BAU baseline (Section 8), including  • Determination of the BAU scenario  • Quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals  Step 5. Compare the downward adjusted baseline from Step 3 and the  conservative BAU baseline from Step 4 (Section 9)  • Is the numerical value of the downward adjusted baseline lower than the  numerical value of the conservative BAU baseline?  Select the downward adjusted baseline Apply a further adjustment to ensure  as the crediting baseline that the downward adjusted baseline  is lower than the conservative BAU  baseline 3 Note that this procedure is applied both ex-ante in the project design document and ex-post in monitoring  reports. Further details on the timing and the ex-post application is included in sections 8 to 9. For ex-  post application of the procedure, in Step 5, the lower between the conservative BAU and the downward  adjusted baseline is selected as the crediting baseline for each calendar year during the crediting period,  rather than going back to Step 3.  9 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 5.1.1. Step 1: Selection of one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of the Rules,  Modalities and Procedures 19. In Step 1, mechanism methodologies shall specify which of the approaches from  paragraph 36 of the Rules, Modalities and Procedures (RMPs) is selected for determining  the crediting baseline for the Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies shall apply  one of the three approaches specified in paragraph 36 of the RMPs for setting the baseline  scenario for each of the components of the activity (e.g., for the capture of landfill gas and  its use for energy generation, one baseline approach may be applied for the capture of  landfill gas and a different baseline approach may be applied for energy generation). The  selected approach shall satisfy the applicability conditions provided for the relevant  approach in section 6 below. The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall also  consider the guidance provided in section 6 on which approaches may be best suited  under different circumstances and justify the appropriateness of the choice among  approaches (i) to (iii) of paragraph 36 of the RMP. 5.1.2. Step 2: Application of the selected baseline approach prior to downward adjustment 20. In step 2, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the selected approach, prior to any  downward adjustment, is applied to determine the baseline scenario and the baselines  emissions and/or removals occurring in the determined baseline scenario. 21. Mechanism methodologies shall define and justify, or require the activity participants to  define and justify, the baseline geographical reference area considering the main baseline  sources or sinks. The baseline geographical reference area may be global, regional,  national, sub-national or site-specific. An Article 6.4 activity type that supplies a global pool  of users with a highly internationally traded good (e.g., aluminium) may need to consider  global conditions when setting the crediting baseline. On the contrary, some Article 6.4  activity types may only affect baseline emissions within a very restricted geographical  scope or even at a specific site4. 22. To determine the baseline scenario, the mechanism methodology shall either:  (a) Specify and justify the baseline scenario; or  (b) Include a stepwise procedure for how activity participants or host countries shall  determine the baseline scenario. 23. The procedure and methodological approaches for paragraph 22 shall follow the  requirements set out in section 6 of this standard. 24. Mechanism methodologies may either use separate approaches to demonstrate  additionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both  demonstrates additionality and determines the baseline scenario, depending on the  approach selected. Specifically, it may be possible to use BAT or an ambitious benchmark  to simultaneously determine the baseline scenario and apply “performance-based  approaches” in demonstrating additionality (refer to the “Standard: Demonstration of  additionality in mechanism methodologies”). Where a combined approach is used, both 4 For example, in the case of switching to a low-emission energy source or feedstock in a specific plant,  only site-specific conditions may need to be considered when setting the crediting baseline.  10 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  this standard and the standard “Demonstration of additionality in mechanism  methodologies” shall apply. 25. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the methods for quantification of the baseline  emissions and/or removals. Mechanism methodologies shall specify to which potential  baseline scenarios its quantification methods are applicable. The methodological  approaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 6 of this standard. 26. Under all three approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs, mechanism methodologies shall  determine whether any trends in the emissions and removals, or the emissions or  removals intensity (i.e., emissions or removals per unit of output), over time should be  incorporated in the baseline quantification. Such trends may, inter alia, arise from  technological improvements over time or occur due to policies. This is necessary if such  trends have a material impact on the emissions and removals, or the emissions or removal  intensity, in the baseline scenario. Where such trends are relevant, mechanism  methodologies may reflect such trends by determining a baseline that declines over time  or by setting the baseline at a sufficiently ambitious level to address any such trends. 5.1.3. Step 3: Application of the downward adjustment 27. In step 3, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the downward adjustment shall be  determined, including the quantification of the downward adjustment and the quantification  of the resulting downward adjusted baseline. 28. Where baseline approaches from RMP paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) have been selected,  exemptions from the downward adjustment may apply in particular circumstances, subject  to the provisions in section 7.2. Where such exemptions are proposed, the proponent of  the mechanism methodology shall provide appropriate justification. 29. The procedure and methodological approaches to determine the downward adjustment  shall follow the requirements set out in section 7. 30. The downward adjusted baseline shall be determined as the baseline emissions and/or  removals determined in Step 2, reduced by the quantified downward adjustment  determined in accordance with the requirements in section 7. Note that for both emissions  and removals baselines, the downward adjustment is subtracted, noting that removals  shall be assigned a negative value and emissions a positive value. 5.1.4. Step 4: Identification of a conservative business-as-usual baseline 31. In step 4, mechanism methodologies shall specify how a conservative business-as-usual  (BAU) baseline shall be determined, including the determination of the BAU scenario and  the quantification of the emissions and/or removals occurring in the BAU scenario. The  methodological approaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 8. 5.1.5. Step 5: Comparison of the downward adjusted baseline and the conservative  business-as-usual baseline 32. In Step 5, mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to compare the  downward adjusted baseline and the conservative BAU baseline and specify the  procedure and methodological approaches to select the crediting baseline following the  requirements set out in section 9.  11 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 5.2. Application of the baseline approaches at different levels of aggregation 33. The baseline scenario or parameters to quantify crediting baseline for emissions and/or  removals, such as baseline emission factors, may be applied at different levels and by  different entities:  (a) Proponent of the mechanism methodology: The proponent of a mechanism  methodology may determine the baseline scenario or parameters to quantify  baseline emissions and/or removals, for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4  activities that are eligible under the methodology. For example, a mechanism  methodology may determine the baseline scenario as the consumption of power  from the electric grid and may accordingly provide methods to determine the grid  emission factor to quantify baseline emissions. The proponent of the mechanism  methodology shall provide documented evidence and justifications in the  methodology that the scenario and/or parameters are applicable for the relevant  activities. The mechanism methodology may then state that these matters are  deemed to be applicable for the relevant activities, as long as the applicability  criteria or conditions specified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism  methodology may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis.  The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration  of the validity of the proposed methodology (e.g., three years). Where the  application of the standardization is mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the  mechanism methodology;  (b) Activity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify  in the methodology how the baseline scenario shall be determined and/or how  baseline emissions and/or removals shall be quantified by each individual activity  applying the methodology. This procedure shall then be applied by each proposed  Article 6.4 activity. For example, a methodology may provide a method for how  each activity shall quantify existing actual or historical emissions and a downward  adjustment factor for them;  (c) Host countries: The proponents of a mechanism methodology shall specify in the  methodology which approaches, parameters or conditions may or shall be  demonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host  countries. This may include standardization in relation to baseline setting, baseline  quantification, or additionality demonstration. Standardization could also relate  only to a specific parameter, such as the grid emission factor or the fraction of non-  renewable biomass. Where the application of the standardized baseline is  mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the standardized baseline. 6. Application of baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of  the Rules, Modalities and Procedures 34. This section sets out how the approaches for setting the baseline referred to in paragraph  36 of the RMP shall be implemented in mechanism methodologies. The section  complements the requirements set out in Step 2 of section 5.  12 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 6.1. Best available technology approach 6.1.1. Applicability 35. Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where the  following applies:  (a) The emissions or removals per unit of output are determined primarily by the  technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity; and  (b) Best available technology (BAT) can be determined with the available data. 36. This approach may be particularly suitable where:  (a) An activity consists of a single technology and/or practice (e.g.,  substitution/installation of new equipment such as clean cooking activities);  and/or  (b) The activity and alternative technologies and/or practices provide reasonably  homogeneous outputs (i.e., they produce similar outputs for the pool of users). 37. If the proposed mechanism methodology falls within the scope of the sector or activity type  identified by the host party to apply BAT as default approach, then only BAT is applicable. 6.1.2. Level of aggregation at which best available technology is determined 38. Mechanism methodologies shall determine, or provide a procedure for activity participants  to determine, the applicability of the BAT baseline, including:  (a) Geographic scope;  (b) Technologies and/or practices for which it is applicable; and  (c) Validity over time. 39. The BAT approach may be applied at different levels and by different entities in line with  the description in Section 5.2 above, including by the proponent of the mechanism  methodology, the activity participant, or by host Parties. Next to such bottom-up  approaches, the Supervisory Body may determine a BAT baseline following a top-down  process. BATs determined by these entities shall have the following geographic scopes:  (a) Supervisory Body: global, or a narrower scope set during the determination of the  BAT;  (b) Host Party: the national boundaries of the Party, or a sub-national scope within the  national boundaries;  (c) Mechanism methodology: the appropriate geographical area as determined in the  mechanism methodology, or a narrower scope specified in the mechanism  methodology for a subset of the potential users;  (d) Activity participants: the location of the corresponding Article 6.4 activity, or as  otherwise specified in the procedure of the mechanism methodology.  13 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 6.1.3. Determination of the best available technology baseline scenario 40. The baseline scenario based on BAT shall be identified as:  (a) An approved BAT determined by the Supervisory Body or by host Parties; or  (b) A BAT specified by the mechanism methodology or determined by the activity  participants following a procedure in the mechanism methodology. 41. When considering whether a technology and/or practice is an economically feasible  course of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or  practice is one that will typically provide sufficient returns to cover investment, operations  & maintenance costs. 42. For technologies and/or practices applied in households, the mechanism methodology  shall define “economically viable course of action” based on the type of activity and  characteristics of the users. The definition may be based on the commonly experienced  costs associated with the technology and/or practice and shall be based on an investment  analysis applying financial parameters that reflect access to finance by households in a  manner that does not overestimate financial barriers, and other relevant considerations. 43. When considering whether a technology and/or practice is an environmentally sound  course of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or  practice is in line with laws and regulations on environmental protection in the applicable  geographical area and seeks to reasonably minimize environmental harm.5 44. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the appropriate baseline geographic reference  area for determining the BAT or provide for principles and requirements that activity  participants shall apply to establish this area with proper justification. 45. The definition of BAT specifies that the technology and/or practice “is available in the  baseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the shelf, or via a tendering or direct  contracting process, or by direct implementation by an end user within the boundary of  potential Article 6.4 activities”. Mechanism methodologies shall consider that when the  Article 6.4 activity type is greenfield and may displace the implementation of new capacity,  then availability relates not just to the specific activity participant, but to any entities that  may implement similar technologies and/or practices; whereas, when the Article 6.4  activity type is implemented within existing installations, the availability may be limited to  those technologies and/or practices available to the activity participants. 46. When the BAT is specified in the mechanism methodology or by the activity participants  following the procedure in the mechanism methodology, then the BAT shall be determined  by applying at least the following steps:  (a) Define the technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity, their  output(s), users, sector and, where relevant, market penetration;  (b) Identify the available technologies and/or practices (and their combinations) in line  with the definitions in this standard for supplying the pool of users in the baseline  geographical reference area, at the scale required for implementation at a similar  level to the activity; 5 As assessed on a mechanism methodology basis or further defined by the Supervisory Body.  14 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (c) Identify which of these available technologies are environmentally sound;  (d) Identify which of the environmentally sound technologies are also economically  viable;  (e) Define the emissions or removals intensity of each of the remaining technologies  identified in step (d) above as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-eq) per  unit of output, based on the average conditions of the technology in the baseline  geographical reference area;  (f) Identify the remaining technology from step (e) above with the best emissions or  removals intensity. This technology constitutes the BAT and its emission or  removals intensity forms the basis for the baseline. 6.1.4. Determination of baseline emissions or removals 47. The mechanism methodology shall define the procedures to quantify the baseline  emissions and/or removals. When the baseline scenario is set using BAT, then the  quantification of the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the  emissions or removals intensity (as tCO2-eq per unit of output) of the identified BAT.  However, approaches other than BAT may be used to determine other parameters  required to quantify the baseline emissions and/or removals. 48. The BAT may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis. The  proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration of the  validity of the proposed methodology.6 6.2. Ambitious benchmark approach 6.2.1. Applicability 49. Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where reliable  data on best performing comparable activities providing similar outputs is available and  permits a conservative and reliable estimation of the baseline. 50. This approach may be particularly suitable where:  (a) The sector is characterized by homogeneous outputs, i.e., if there are similar  outputs with a similar level of service for the pool of users; and/or  (b) The emissions or removals per unit of output depend on multiple factors (inter alia,  technology and/or operational practices, fuels, feedstocks, local circumstances  such as climatic conditions). 6.2.2. Determination of the baseline scenario and baseline emissions and/or removals 51. The baseline scenario based on an ambitious benchmark shall be identified as the  average emissions or removals level of the best performing comparable activities  providing similar outputs in a defined scope in similar social, economic, environmental,  and technological circumstances. Mechanism methodologies shall further specify this 6 In case the validity of a BAT expires, users of the mechanism methodology may propose a request for  revision to update the underlying analysis and validity.  15 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  approach and justify the methodological choices made, including specification of the  criteria for similarity of circumstances. 52. Mechanism methodologies shall either directly set the ambitious benchmark, or define a  procedure that activity participants shall apply for setting the crediting baseline based on  an ambitious benchmark, considering the following steps:7  (a) Define and justify the appropriate baseline geographical reference area for the type  of technology and/or practice;  (b) Identify all technologies and/or practices (e.g., types of industrial plants, types of  household units, as applicable to the activity type) that are providing similar output  in the baseline geographical reference area in similar social, economic,  environmental, and technological circumstances8;  (c) Specify which comparable activities (e.g., individual installations or units such as  industrial plants, households) in the baseline geographical reference area shall be  included in the analysis, taking into account the type and characteristics of the  Article 6.4 activity. For example, if the Article 6.4 activity consists of the installation  of greenfield plants, then only recently built installations shall be included in the  analysis. For brownfield Article 6.4 activities (e.g., energy efficiency  improvements), existing installations may be considered, depending on the  circumstances. Similarly, only activities of a similar size (e.g., plants above a  certain threshold) or within certain locations (e.g., only households in rural areas)  may be considered, depending on the context of the Article 6.4 activity. If an Article  6.4 activity replaces existing installations while at the same expanding the capacity,  comparable activities shall include installations, or combinations of installations,  that can provide the same level of service as the Article 6.4 activity;  (d) Select a suitable indicator for determining the performance of the comparable  activities (e.g. tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, energy efficiency of  appliances);  (e) Determine the appropriate time period for which available performance data for all  identified technologies and/or practices shall be included. In some cases, one year  may be an appropriate period In cases where the performance varies significantly  between calendar years (e.g., due to differences in climatic conditions such as  precipitation), an appropriate multi-year period (e.g., three years) shall be selected.  The choice shall be appropriately conservative and be justified;  (f) Collect recent performance data for the comparable activities of the identified  technologies and/or practices in the baseline geographical reference area; 7 Mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches towards determining an ambitious  benchmark. 8  For example, for cement for building construction applications, the technologies are those being  applied for building construction with similar structural capabilities, e.g., other cement production for  concrete-based construction, wood-frame construction, steel-frame construction, masonry. For another  example, metal-alloy production, the technologies are those being applied for the same metal-alloy  production.  16 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (g) Prepare a performance distribution curve, using the selected indicator such as  tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, for the total amount of output provided  by the comparable activities in the baseline geographical reference area;  (h) Specify how to define the group of best performing comparable activities bounded  at maximum by the 20th percentile of the distribution curve or lower (e.g., 10th  percentile, 5th percentile), and justify the choice;  (i) Calculate the weighted average (by output) performance of all the best performing  comparable activities including and beyond the selected percentile, using the  selected indicator such as tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output. 53. The value determined in sub-bullet (h) constitutes the ambitious benchmark and shall form  the basis for quantifying the baseline emissions and/or removals. 54. Mechanism methodologies shall define the methods for quantification of the ambitious  benchmark baseline. When the baseline scenario is set using an ambitious benchmark,  then the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the benchmark.  However, other parameters needed to quantify baseline emissions and/or removals may  be derived using other approaches (for example, an ambitious benchmark for the energy  efficiency of comparable activities may be combined with a default value for the specific  GHG intensity per unit of energy). 55. When the ambitious benchmark is determined by activity participants, by applying a  procedure defined in a mechanism methodology, the mechanism methodology shall  specify which type of data sources may be used by activity participants. The mechanism  methodology should aim to ensure that the data is both of high quality and recent,  preferably with a vintage of no more than 3 years prior to the year in which the PDD is  submitted for global stakeholder consultation. 6.3. Existing actual or historical emissions approach 6.3.1. Applicability 56. Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where there  is limited data availability on the emissions or removals performance from similar activities  in the sector. 57. This approach may be particularly suitable where:  (a) Emissions or removals per unit of output are dependent on factors that are highly  activity- or site-specific; and/or  (b) Sector data shows strongly heterogeneous circumstances. 58. Where an Article 6.4 activity replaces specific equipment that was used in the pre-project  scenario and could continue to be used, a baseline scenario determined using this  approach shall only remain valid until, at maximum, the end of the reasonably expected  remaining lifetime of the equipment that was used in the pre-activity scenario. 6.3.2. Baseline scenario selection 59. The baseline scenario may be identified based on existing actual or historical emissions.  17 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 60. The mechanism methodology shall specify a pre-determined baseline scenario or contain  a procedure to determine the baseline scenario. Possible baseline scenarios may include:  (a) The continuation of the pre-activity scenario up to a certain point in time (for  example, up to the time at which a retrofit would have occurred);  (b) A dynamic baseline scenario over time (for example, if a gradual shift away from  the pre-activity scenario is observed);  (c) The retrofit or replacement of equipment that has been used in the pre-activity  scenario;  (d) The implementation of the Article 6.4 activity at a later point in time. 6.3.3. Methods for quantification of baseline emissions and/or removals 61. The mechanism methodology shall define the methods to quantify the baseline emissions  and/or removals as tCO2-eq or the baseline emissions or removals intensity as tCO2-eq  per unit of output. The determination shall be consistent with the identified baseline  scenario. The baseline may be derived using the following general methods:  (a) Site-specific historical data: Where this method is used, the mechanism  methodology shall address issues related to the minimum number of historical  years to consider, year-on-year variability, any trends in the historical data and the  need for the use of factors to account for improvements in performance that may  occur in the baseline scenario over time;  (b) Control group: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall  establish requirements related to selection of the control group; shared  characteristics between the activity and control groups such as location, pre-  activity and project technologies and/or practices, and socio-economic  circumstances; and statistical tests for similarity between the control and activity  group;  (c) Model: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall address the  selection, calibration, capabilities, credibility and conservativeness of models; and  (d) Default factors: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall  specify the source of the default factors used and ensure their relevance and  conservativeness. 7. Determination of the downward adjustment 62. Mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition through setting crediting baselines  below BAU and increasing the ambition of crediting baselines over time. Therefore,  mechanism methodologies shall include factors or quantitative methods for downward  adjustment appropriate to the sector, Article 6.4 activity type and scale of the activity. The  factors or quantitative methods shall be based on clear and objective criteria and shall  result in a downward adjustment that ensures the selected baseline is below BAU and  encourages ambition over time.  18 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 7.1. Downward adjustment in the calendar year of the start date of the first  crediting period 63. For baselines determined based on BAT or an ambitious benchmark, no downward  adjustment shall apply in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. 64. For baselines determined based on existing actual or historical emissions, the downward  adjustment in the calendar year of the start of the first crediting period shall be determined  as follows:  (a) Through the following step-wise procedure:  i. Determine the uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval  relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified unadjusted net  baseline emissions and/or removals at 95% confidence level during the first  crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 ). The determination of the uncertainty  shall consider all causes of uncertainty as per paragraph 13 of section 4 in  Appendix 1;  ii. Determine the downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or removals  based on uncertainty for the calendar year of the start date of the first  crediting period (BEadj,U,y), as follows9;  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 ) Equation (1)  Where:  Downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 =  removals based on uncertainty in year y  Unadjusted existing actual or historical net baseline  𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 =  emissions and/or removals in year y  Uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty  interval relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante  𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 =  quantified unadjusted net baseline emissions and/or  removals during the first crediting period (fraction)  Calendar year of the start date of the first crediting  y =  period  iii. Determine the minimum downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or  removals for the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period  (BEadj,min,y), as follows;  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 − (𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 − 𝐴𝐸𝑦 ) ∗ 0.1 Equation (2)  Where:  Minimum downward adjusted baseline  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 =  emissions and/or removals in year y. 9 Where, for the uncertainty of a central value, the absolute upper bound is a positive number and the  absolute lower bound a negative number, or vice-versa, further guidance will be developed.  19 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  Unadjusted existing actual or historical net baseline  𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 =  emissions and/or removals in year y  Ex-ante estimated activity emissions and/or removals in  𝐴𝐸𝑦 =  year y  y = Calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period  iv. Compare the downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or removals  based on uncertainty (BEadj,UNC,y) and the minimum downward adjusted  baseline emissions and/or removals (BEadj,min,y) and select the lower as the  downward adjusted baseline;  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑦 = min(𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 , 𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 ) Equation (3)  Where:  Downward adjusted baseline emissions  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑦 =  and/or removals in year y  Calendar year of the start date of the first  y =  crediting period  OR  (b) Through another approach proposed in the mechanism methodology,  considering the minimum downward adjustment described in the method above. 7.2. Downward adjustment in subsequent years 65. For all three baseline approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs (i.e., BAT, ambitious  benchmark, and existing actual or historical emissions), a downward adjustment shall  apply in all calendar years following the start date of the first crediting period, unless an  exemption in specific circumstances is approved by the Supervisory Body. 66. Such exemptions shall only apply to baselines based on BAT or ambitious benchmarks.  Economic viability could be a consideration for exemptions, for example, where the  application of a downward adjustment may result in no calculated emission reductions or  net removals. 67. The downward adjustment applied in subsequent years shall increase over time to  encourage ambition over time and ensure that the baseline is below BAU. 68. For baselines determined based on existing actual or historical emissions, the starting  point for increasing the downward adjustment over time shall be the downward adjustment  in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period, as determined in section  7.1 above. For baselines determined based on BAT or an ambitious benchmark, the  downward adjustment shall increase from a value of zero applied in the calendar year of  the start date of the first crediting period.  20 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 69. The increase in the downward adjustments over time shall be operationalised either as an  annual change or as stepwise change implemented not less frequently than every three  years. An increase in the downward adjustment shall be applied starting on 1 January of  a calendar year. The first increase shall be applied in the calendar year following the  calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. 70. Mechanism methodology shall specify the factors or quantitative methods to calculate the  downward adjustment for subsequent calendar years of the crediting period and how the  increase over time is operationalised. The determination of the downward adjustment may  be based on the following principles and considerations:  (a) Consideration of economic viability of the mitigation technologies and/or  practices: The quantitative methods and factors could consider the economic  viability of the relevant mitigation activities. This holds in particular for critical  mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization technologies,  and negative emission approaches. The quantitative methods and factors could  result in relatively lower downward adjustments for these technologies and  approaches, and other critical technologies at an early stage of innovation and  diffusion, compared with technologies and/or practices that are closer to being  economically viable;  (b) Setting incentives for the adoption of less GHG intensive technologies  and/or practices: The factors and quantitative methods could result in a relatively  higher downward adjustment for more GHG intensive technologies and/or  practices and a relatively lower downward adjustment for less GHG intensive  technologies and/or practices10;  (c) Consideration of established long-term pathways: Already established long-  term pathways for emissions, technologies and/or practices adopted by Parties,  groups of Parties and/or international industry associations could inform the  downward adjustment. This could mean that some sectors, regions or Parties  would have greater annual increases to the downward adjustment compared with  others;  (d) Consideration of concept of sufficiency: Considering work on sufficiency  presented in IPCC AR6 WGIII, Chapter 9, the factors and quantitative methods  could result in a relatively higher downward adjustment for activities implemented  in a context of high resource consumption patterns and a relatively lower downward  adjustment for lower resource consumption patterns11;  (e) Consideration of suppressed demand: The quantitative methods and factors  could result in a relatively lower downward adjustment for sectors or regions where  demand is suppressed. 10 For example, the downward adjustment may be higher for Article 6.4 activities flaring landfill gas than for  activities using the landfill gas as fuel; 11 For example, in the buildings sector, it may be proposed that for communities whose energy consumption  was historically high, the rate of reducing emissions is higher than that for communities with historically  low energy consumption  21 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 71. The annual increase in the downward adjustment shall correspond to at least 1% of the  baseline emissions in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. A pro-  rata approach may be used to apply this minimum value to periods other than a full  calendar year. 8. Determination of a conservative business-as-usual  baseline 72. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to demonstrate that the downward  adjusted baseline is below BAU. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall  require the identification of a conservative BAU scenario that would occur in the absence  of the Article 6.4 activity and provide a method for the quantification of the corresponding  BAU emissions and/or removals in a conservative manner. The BAU also may be defined  using an approved standardized baseline. 73. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall consider the following alternatives for  the purpose of determining the BAU scenario and justify the choice, including how it  ensures conservativeness:  (a) Continuation of the historical situation (pre-activity scenario);  (b) Establishment of an economically viable technology and/or practice;  (c) A scenario combining (a) for the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or  practice, followed afterwards by (b); or  (d) Only when it is justified that the previous alternatives are not suitable, another  relevant scenario in line with the applicable principles and requirements set out in  this standard. 74. Where several scenarios are plausible, the most conservative scenario shall be chosen  as the BAU scenario. 75. The proponent of a mechanism methodology may consider the following approaches for  estimating the BAU emissions and/or removals and shall justify the choice:  (a) Where the activity is not a greenfield activity, mechanism methodologies may  consider the historical emissions or emissions intensity prior to the implementation  of the activity, including any trends toward improving performance, for the  remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice; or  (b) Where the activity is a greenfield activity, or where it operates beyond the end of  the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice, mechanism  methodologies may consider the average emissions intensity of new capacity  installed in the past three years, in the baseline geographical reference area,  and/or in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances  and providing similar outputs as the activity with these criteria specified further in  the mechanism methodology.  22 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 76. In determining the BAU scenario and quantifying the BAU emissions and/or removals  pursuant to paragraphs 72 to 75 above, mechanism methodologies shall identify and  incorporate in the BAU:  (a) Any policies that are active or scheduled to take effect within the crediting period,  unless they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation. All legal requirements shall be deemed to be enforced while  recognizing that regulatory environments vary; and  (b) Any specific national or sub-national targets for the sector or the type of activity, as  long as these are supported by policy frameworks for implementation12, but not  general goals that are not specific to the sector or type of activity. 77. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the comparison of the downward adjusted  baseline with the BAU baseline in section 5 (Step 5 in Figure 1) results in the determination  of a crediting baseline that is below BAU. For this purpose, mechanism methodologies  shall identify the conservative BAU baseline as follows:  (a) Through the following step-wise procedure:  i. Determine the uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval  relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified BAU net baseline  emissions and/or removals during the first crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 ).  The determination of the uncertainty shall consider all causes of  uncertainty as per paragraph 13 in Appendix 1;  ii. Determine the conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals  based on uncertainty for the relevant year or period (BAUcons,UNC,y), as  follows13;  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 ) Equation (4)  Where:  Uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval  relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified most  𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 =  likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals during the  first crediting period year y (fraction)  Conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 =  on uncertainty in year y  Most likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals in  𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝑦 =  year y  y = Relevant year or period (see instructions below) 12 The extent to which the policy frameworks in place are sufficient to enable the achievement of the targets  may be considered in determining their relevance for the BAU scenario and quantification, as well as  whether they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for implementation. 13 Where, for the uncertainty of a central value, the absolute upper bound of the uncertainty interval is a  positive number and the absolute lower bound of the uncertainty interval a negative number, or vice-  versa, further guidance will be developed.  23 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  iii. Determine the minimum conservative value of the BAU baseline during the  first crediting period as follows:  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 − (𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 − 𝐴𝐸𝑦 ) ∗ 0.1 Equation (5)  Where:  Minimum conservative BAU baseline emissions  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 =  and/or removals in year y  𝐴𝐸𝑦 = Activity emissions and/or removals in year y  Y = Relevant year or period (see instructions below)  iv. Compare the conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based  on uncertainty (BAUcons,UNC,y) and the minimum conservative BAU baseline  emissions and/or removals (BAUcons,min,y) and select the lower as the  conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals;  𝐵𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑦 = min(𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 , 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 ) Equation (6)  Where:  Conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or  𝐵𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑦 =  removals in year y  Relevant year or period (see instructions  y =  below)  OR  (b) Propose another approach that ensures that the selected crediting baseline is  below BAU, considering the minimum discount described in the method above. 78. The BAU scenario and quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals shall be  determined:  (a) Ex ante in the PDD at the start of the first crediting period for the same duration as  the crediting period of the proposed Article 6.4 activity, specifying the BAU  emissions and/or removals for each calendar year within the crediting period; and  (b) Ex post for each calendar year within the crediting period. 79. For the ex-post quantification of the BAU baseline emissions and/or removals, mechanism  methodologies shall specify which parameters are determined ex-ante and remain fixed  for the crediting period and which parameters are updated for each calendar year or at a  different frequency. 80. The BAU scenario shall be redetermined at each crediting period renewal and the same  analysis shall be carried out.  24 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 9. Comparison and selection of crediting baseline 81. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to require activity participants to  undertake the following comparisons. 82. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to compare, ex-ante in the  project design document, the following two baselines:  (a) The downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3; and  (b) The conservative BAU baseline resulting from Step 4. 83. Where the ex-ante conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals is lower than  the ex-ante downward adjusted baseline for any calendar year or cumulatively over the  crediting period, then the mechanism methodology shall require the activity participant to  return to Step 3 and revise the quantitative methods and factors to determine the  downward adjustment, to ensure that the downward adjusted baseline is lower than the  conservative BAU baseline for each calendar year and cumulatively for the crediting  period. 84. Mechanism methodologies shall further require activity participants to compare, ex-post  in monitoring reports, for each individual calendar year during the crediting period, the ex-  post calculated downward adjusted baseline for the year and the ex-post calculated  conservative BAU baseline for the same year and confirm that the downward adjusted  baseline is lower than the conservative BAU baseline. If it is not, then the conservative  BAU baseline shall be used for that calendar year.  25 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 Appendix 1. General requirements for mechanism  methodologies 1. Applicability conditions 1. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the conditions under which proposed Article 6.4  activities may use the methodology. Applicability conditions shall clearly describe the  technologies and/or practices which are eligible under a methodology as well as, if  appropriate, those which are not. 2. Applicability conditions shall also prevent the use of the methodologies in contexts,  configurations and cases for which these are not intended and under which an  overestimation of emission reductions or net removals and/or perverse incentives could  occur. 3. For each applicability condition, the mechanism methodology shall specify whether the  fulfilment of the condition shall be assessed:  (a) Once at the initial validation of the PDD or, where the information is not yet  available, at the first verification of emission reductions or net removals; or  (b) At each verification of emission reductions or net removals. 2. Definition of the activity boundary 4. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all emission sources, sinks or  reservoirs that could be altered by Article 6.4 activities that are eligible under the  methodology. For each identified source, sink or reservoir, the proponent shall indicate  whether it pertains to the baseline scenario and/or the Article 6.4 activity scenario. The  proponent shall compare the sources, sinks and reservoirs between the two scenarios in  a tabular format to ensure a complete and fair comparison. 5. The proponent shall further indicate whether each identified source, sink and reservoir is  controlled, related to, or otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4 activities, in line  with the definitions, and provide adequate justification. Note that some sources, sinks or  reservoirs may be classified in different ways, depending on the configuration of the Article  6.4 activity1; where applicable, this should be indicated. 6. Based on this analysis, mechanism methodologies shall define the activity boundary of  the applicable Article 6.4 activities, including which emission sources, sinks or reservoirs  and GHGs are included. The activity boundary shall be presented in table, covering both  the Article 6.4 activity scenario and the baseline scenario. 1 For example, in some activities, a source of transport emissions may be controlled whereas in others it  may be related.  26 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 7. The activity boundary shall include all emission sources, sinks or reservoirs that are  identified as controlled or related. The activity boundary also may include sources, sinks  or reservoirs that are identified as otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4  activities. 2 Changes in anthropogenic emissions and/or removals of GHGs that occur  outside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity shall be considered  as leakage, subject to the provisions in the draft standard “Addressing leakage in  mechanism methodologies”. 8. Mechanism methodologies may omit sources, sinks or GHGs from the activity boundary,  provided that the omission leads to a more conservative quantification of emission  reductions or net removals. For example, where it can be demonstrated for the range of  activities that may apply the methodology that upstream emissions associated with the  Article 6.4 scenario are lower than upstream emissions associated with the baseline  scenario, the relevant upstream emissions may be omitted in both the Article 6.4 activity  scenario and the baseline scenario. The mechanism methodology may also specify  conditions under which certain sources, sinks, reservoirs or GHGs shall be considered or  may be omitted. The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall demonstrate and  provide appropriate justifications for any such omissions, including that the omission is  conservative for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology. 9. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to delineate the geographical  boundary of a proposed Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies may require activity  participants to specify the location of the activity in the form of Keyhole Markup Language  files or similar formats as one or more polygon(s), by specifying the coordinates of the  geographic boundary using a known coordinate system or any other method to delineate  the geographic boundary. The geographic boundary may cover more than one host Party.  Where appropriate, the mechanism methodology may request the location of the leakage  emission sources and sinks to be described as well. 10. Mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the activity, does not  constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party  with regard to the nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, its long-term  low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS), if it has submitted one,  and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and long-term goals of the  Paris Agreement through an assessment, undertaken by the DNA of the host Party, of the  activity’s consistency with Decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 40 (c) and paragraph 27 (a) as  part of the host Party’s approval. 3. Calculation of emission reductions or net removals 11. Mechanisms methodologies shall include provisions to determine emission reductions or  net removals separately for each calendar year. To address situations where monitoring  periods cover more than one calendar year, mechanism methodologies shall specify  methods to allocate the emission reductions or net removals achieved during a monitoring  period to calendar years. The method of allocation shall be based on the best 2 For example, for activities that provide renewable electricity to the grid and thereby affect electricity  generation by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a  baseline emission source within the activity boundary.  27 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  approximation for when the emission reductions or net removals have likely occurred. The  following approaches shall be used:  (a) Proportional allocation: Where this is plausible, emissions or removals in the  monitoring period shall be allocated proportionally to the duration of the period in  each calendar year. If annual caps or other annual values are applied in the  methodology, these shall be pro-rated to periods shorter than a full calendar year;  (b) Allocation based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns: Where  proportional allocation is not plausible, emissions or removals in the monitored  period shall be allocated based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns.  For example, for an afforestation activity, growth tables for the respective species  and local conditions may be used to allocate a stock change observed over a multi-  year period to individual calendar years; 12. Mechanism methodologies shall specify whether the type of Article 6.4 activities covered  by the methodology may generate emission reductions, net removals, or both emission  reductions and net removals. Where Article 6.4 activities may generate both emission  reductions and net removals, mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to  separately determine the emission reductions and the net removals that have occurred in  a monitoring period. 4. Conservativeness and uncertainty 13. Mechanism methodologies shall apply a conservative approach to ensure that the  emission reductions or net removals from an Article 6.4 activity using the methodology are  very unlikely to be overestimated, taking into account the overall uncertainty in quantifying  the emission reductions or net removals. The implementation of conservativeness (e.g.,  through conservative assumptions, parameters, discounts) in determining the calculated  emission reductions or net removals shall be based on the level of uncertainty (e.g.,  applying a larger deduction in case of higher uncertainties). All causes of uncertainty shall  be considered, including uncertainty in data (e.g., measurements), parameters (e.g.,  representativeness of default values), assumptions (e.g., the baseline scenario), and  methods (e.g., models to quantify emission reductions). 5. Attributability of emission reductions or net removals to the Article 6.4  activity 14. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the quantified emission reductions or net  removals result from the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and not from changes in  exogenous factors that are not related to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity.  Mechanism methodologies shall therefore require approaches that take into account and  adjust for exogenous factors affecting emission reductions or net removals. 6. Potential perverse incentives 15. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify any potential perverse  incentives for the activity participants to inflate the calculated emissions reductions or net  removals. This may include cases where output levels could increase as a result of the  incentive of the mechanism. Where such perverse incentives can occur, the mechanism  methodology shall ensure that they are avoided.  28 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 7. Rebound effects 16. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that rebound effects (i.e., an increase in the level  of service as a result of the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity, e.g., when introducing  energy-efficient appliances) are accounted for. Where applying the provisions with regard  to suppressed demand, further requirements or guidance from relevant other standard(s)  may be considered. 8. Avoidance of double counting 17. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify risks of potential double  counting of the emission reductions or net removals and, where such risks are relevant  and material, include provisions to avoid such double counting in the mechanism  methodology. This shall include but not be limited to:  (a) Double counting due to overlapping claims between different crediting mechanism  activities;  (b) Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes; and  (c) Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets. 8.1. Double counting due to overlapping claims between different carbon crediting  mechanism activities 18. Double counting may occur if different carbon crediting mechanism activities claim the  same emission reductions or removals. The consideration of this form of double counting  shall include but not be limited to:  (a) The risk of different entities claiming the emission reductions or removals  associated with the production and use of goods or services (e.g., both the  producer and the consumer of a biofuel claiming the same emission reductions);  (b) The risk of overlap from emission sources or carbon pools that occur upstream and  downstream of the activity (e.g., an efficient cookstove activity and an avoided  deforestation activity claiming the same emission reductions);  (c) The risk of overlap due to implementation of activities at different aggregation  levels within the same geographical area (e.g., a project-scale avoided  deforestation activity falling within the scope of a jurisdictional avoided  deforestation activity). 19. This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by requiring  agreement between the entities that may potentially seek carbon credits for the same  emission reductions or removals. 8.2. Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes 20. Double counting may occur if an Article 6.4 activity reduces emissions or enhances  removals that are covered by a mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g. an emissions  29 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  trading system). This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies  by:  (a) Excluding activities or not issuing Article 6.4 ERs for emission reductions or  removals that are subject to such overlap; or  (b) Requiring that measures are in place to ensure that any relevant impacts of the  activity (e.g., inter alia the GHG emission reductions achieved or the kilowatt-hours  of renewable electricity produced) are not counted towards the achievement of  targets or obligations under the mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g., inter  alia by cancelling allowances from the emissions trading system before issuing  carbon credits). 8.3. Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets 21. Double counting may occur if the mitigation outcomes achieved by an Article 6.4 activity  are also claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets (e.g. guarantees of origin  for renewable electricity generation, green hydrogen schemes, low carbon fuel standards,  etc.). Note that this only holds if mitigation outcomes (e.g., emission reductions, removal  enhancements, renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, etc.) are  claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets, but not where other outcomes  (e.g., air contaminant reductions or social impacts) are claimed. 22. This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by:  (a) Excluding activities or not issuing Article 6.4 emission reductions for emission  reductions or removals that are subject to such overlap; or  (b) Requiring that the Article 6.4 activity does not claim the same mitigation outcomes  in the relevant other environmental markets or accounting frameworks. 9. Monitoring 23. Mechanism methodologies shall specify procedures and methods for the monitoring all  data and parameters necessary to calculate the emission reductions or net removals from  Article 6.4 activities using the methodology. 24. Further requirements related to monitoring may be introduced in this standard in the future. 10. Aggregation of information 25. Where appropriate, mechanism methodologies may consolidate information within a  geographical area and a sector, to provide observations at a broader level than an  individual Article 6.4 activity. Comparable activities can be grouped or aggregated to  provide a broader picture when this does not lead to misrepresentation. Comparable  activities can also be split or disaggregated, when this does not lead to misrepresentation,  for example when the sector shows great heterogeneity. 11. Validity and periodic updating of mechanism methodologies 26. In accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of  methodologies and methodological tools”, approved methodologies and methodological  tools that have been applied in projects shall be reviewed on a regular basis.

Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This standard sets out requirements for mechanism methodologies to first identify  potential sources of leakage, then seek to avoid or, where this is not possible, minimize  any negative leakage, and subsequently calculate and subtract any remaining negative  leakage of an Article 6.4 activity. 1.2. Entry into force 2. This document enters into force on 16 May 2025. 2. Definitions 3. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Activity participant: A public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4  activity;  (b) Activity boundary: The boundary that encompasses the greenhouse gas (GHG)  sources, sinks and reservoirs that are controlled or related. The activity boundary  may also include GHG sources, sinks or reservoirs that are otherwise affected by  the activity;1  (c) Controlled sources, sinks and reservoirs: GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs  that are under the direction and influence of the activity participant through  financial, policy, management or other instruments;  (d) Leakage: Changes in anthropogenic emissions and/or removals of GHGs that  occur outside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity, including  those resulting from changes in market demand or supply for associated outputs.  Leakage may involve the following sub-forms:  (i) Positive leakage: Leakage where the implementation of an Article 6.4  activity results in a decrease in emissions and/or an increase in removals;  (ii) Negative leakage: Leakage where the implementation of an Article 6.4  activity results in an increase in emissions and/or a decrease in removals;  (e) Level of service: The quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an  Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;  (f) Output: Each good or service provided by the Article 6.4 activity and/or in the  baseline scenario2, as specified in the mechanism methodology; 1 For example, for activities that provide renewable electricity to the grid and thereby affect electricity  generation by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a  baseline emission source within the activity boundary. Furthermore, note that in the case of activities  implemented at project-scale, the activity boundary is equivalent to the project boundary. 2 For example, electricity, energy for cooking, or municipal waste management.  3 of 8  A6.4-STAN-METH-005 Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (g) Related sources, sinks and reservoirs: GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs that  have material or energy flows into, out of, or within the Article 6.4 activity. 3. Applicability 4. This standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions  and net removals. 5. This version of the standard is applicable to mechanism methodologies for activities  undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to cover  methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes of  activities, policies, sectoral approaches). 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For  simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. 4. General requirements 7. Mechanism methodologies shall include all leakage sources in the calculation of emission  reductions or net removals, unless their exclusion is conservative (e.g., the exclusion of a  source of positive leakage). Where the proponent of a mechanism methodology can  demonstrate that, for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology,  certain positive leakage sources are consistently larger than certain negative leakage  sources, then these leakage sources may be omitted in the calculation of emission  reductions and/or net removals. 8. The proponent of mechanism methodologies shall assess whether the implementation of  Article 6.4 activities covered by the methodology could lead to any changes in the type(s)  of output or level(s) of service provided as compared to the baseline scenario. When the  type(s) of output or the level(s) of service provided in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  change compared to the baseline scenario, this can result in leakage3. Such leakage shall  either be:  (a) Prevented by designing the Article 6.4 activity in such a way that the same type(s)  of output or level(s) of service is provided in the Article 6.4 activity scenario as in  the baseline scenario (e.g., by providing respective applicability conditions or  expanding the geographical activity boundary); or  (b) Addressed by quantifying and subtracting any negative leakage resulting from the  change in the type(s) of output or level(s) of service. 9. The relevant geographical area for consideration of leakage may not be limited to national  boundaries and shall include international leakage (i.e., leakage beyond national  boundaries) where this occurs. 10. If the sum of all sources of leakage results in a net decrease in GHG emissions or increase  in GHG removals, then the resulting leakage shall be set equal to zero in the quantification  of the emission reductions or net removals. 3 For example, a renewable power plant constructed on agricultural land could lead to a change in the  type or level(s) of agricultural production.  4 of 8  A6.4-STAN-METH-005 Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 5. Procedures to address leakage 11. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to first identify potential sources of  leakage, then seek to avoid or, where this is not possible, to minimize any negative  leakage and subsequently calculate and subtract any remaining negative leakage as per  the specifications below. 5.1. Identification of leakage 12. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all potential sources of leakage  for the type of mitigation activities covered by the methodology. This shall include, but not  be limited to, the following sources of leakage:  (a) Baseline equipment transfer: This source of leakage is relevant where:  (i) Equipment used within the activity boundary prior to the implementation of  the Article 6.4 activity would continue to be used in the baseline scenario and  is being replaced under the Article 6.4 activity scenario; and  (ii) The replaced equipment is functional, has a value for third parties and could  continue to be used outside of the activity boundary where it may potentially  displace less GHG intensive processes4;  (b) Competition for resource use5: This source of leakage is relevant where:  (i) The Article 6.4 activity increases, relative to the baseline scenario, the  consumption of resources that have competing uses;  (ii) The availability of the resources is limited within the relevant geographical  area; and  (iii) The potential diversion of the resources from other uses to the Article 6.4  activity could lead to an increase in GHG gas emissions or decrease of  removals outside the activity boundary;  (c) Diversion of existing production processes or outputs: This source of leakage is  relevant where6:  (i) The type(s) of output or level(s) of services provided under the Article 6.4  activity changes compared to the baseline scenario; and 4 For example, this may occur as a result of replacing a fossil-fuel boiler with a biomass boiler where the  fossil-fuel boiler is re-used in another location. 5 For example, this may happen where biomass is used to replace fossil fuel but the resulting scarcity in  biomass leads current biomass users to switch to fossil-fuels. Another example is the use of agricultural  by-products as fuels or feedstocks, where the diversion of biomass from application on fields to  alternative uses may result in an increased use of synthetic fertilizer. 6 For example, this may be applicable to activities that involve, shifting pre-project activities, such as  grazing or agriculture, outside of the activity boundary, as a result of changes in management or use of  land.  5 of 8  A6.4-STAN-METH-005 Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (ii) The change could lead to an increase in emissions and/or a decrease in  removals outside the activity boundary7;  (d) Increases in release of GHGs from the environment as a result of implementing  the Article 6.4 activity.8 13. The requirement in paragraph 12(b) above may not apply to fossil fuels or mineral products  considering that their availability can be expanded through increased extraction in case of  increased demand. 5.2. Avoidance or minimisation of leakage 14. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to seek to avoid or, where this is not  possible, to minimize all identified sources of negative leakage by applying, inter alia, the  approaches below as appropriate for the given sector and the type of mitigation activities  covered by the methodology. Avoiding or minimizing leakage may be done, for example,  by limiting the scope of applicability conditions, as follows:  (a) If baseline equipment transfer is identified as a potential source of leakage,  mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions that require the  destruction, decommission or disposal of the baseline equipment and the provision  of relevant evidence9;  (b) If competition for resource use is identified as a potential source of leakage,  mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions to demonstrate  abundance of such resource and that such resource would not be used in the  baseline scenario. Abundance demonstrations shall be based on requirements  provided for in methodologies and shall account for the economic and  environmental impacts of diverting resources from prior use cases, including with  respect to the sustainable use of natural or human-managed ecosystems;10  (c) If changes in the type of output(s) or level(s) of service are identified as a potential  source of leakage, mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions  requiring the demonstration of equivalence of output(s) and level(s) of service.11 15. As per paragraph 87 of the Methodologies Standard12, if the proposed activity falls under  the scope of Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement (i.e., REDD+ activities),  mechanism methodologies shall further require demonstration that the activity is included 7 For example, this may occur where agricultural production is reduced because of the activity and new  production is established on land that was previously forested. 8 For example, this may consist in increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils in a wetland if the water  level is lowered due to the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity due to an activity on a neighboring  land. 9 For example, methodologies can establish applicability conditions to require baseline refrigeration  equipment to undergo refrigerant recovery and destruction as well as scrapping of the equipment. 10 For example, methodologies can establish applicability conditions to prevent soil depletion by requiring  that a minimum amount of biomass must be retained per unit of land. 11 For example, if reforestation Article 6.4 activities could result in diversion of pre-project activities such as  agriculture, mechanism methodologies can include conditions which limit applicability to activities on  degraded lands which do not result in such diversion. 12 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf.  6 of 8  A6.4-STAN-METH-005 Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  in all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71. This  demonstration shall be done using official documentation from the host country  communicated to the UNFCCC secretariat pursuant to relevant guidance and decisions,  as follows:  (a) The proposed A6.4 activity is included in the host country’s national strategy or  action plan referred to in decision 1/CP.16, para 71(a);  (b) Inclusion of the geographical activity boundary in the host country’s national forest  reference emission level and/or forest reference level referred to in decision  1/CP.16, para 71(b);  (c) Inclusion of the geographical activity boundary in the national forest monitoring  system referred to in decision 1/CP.16, para 71(c);  (d) The proposed A6.4 activity is included in and reports to the system for providing  information on safeguards referred to in 1/CP.16, para 71(d) (without prejudice to  the use of the SD Tool). 16. If the proposed A6.4 activity is not yet included in all the elements required of the host  Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, mechanism methodologies may require, on  an interim basis, a letter from the host country’s national entity or focal point referred to in  decision 2/CP.10 (i.e., the REDD+ focal point) indicating when the proposed A6.4 activity  will be included in all the elements above. The inclusion shall occur no later than  Verification and be verified by the DOE. 5.3. Calculation and subtraction of leakage 17. If negative leakage cannot be avoided through measures such as those indicated in the  preceding section, mechanism methodologies shall include procedures to calculate the  remaining net leakage (i.e., the balance of any positive and negative leakage) and, should  the net leakage be negative, subtract it in the quantification of emission reductions or net  removals. 18. Where baseline equipment transfer cannot be avoided by measures such as destruction,  decommissioning or disposal of the baseline equipment, mechanism methodologies shall  provide approaches to calculate any resulting negative leakage from continued use of the  equipment. Such approaches may need to consider: the remaining lifetime of the  equipment, the possible usage scenarios and the usage rate of the equipment (e.g., how  many hours within a year the equipment is used), the GHG emissions intensity of the  transferred equipment and the type and GHG intensity of the equipment that is being  replaced by the transferred equipment. 19. Where the use of competing resources cannot be avoided through demonstration of  abundance and non-use in the baseline scenario, mechanism methodologies shall include  procedures to account for any resulting negative leakage. Such procedures may include  consideration of the quantity of resources used under the Article 6.4 activity that are  subject to competing uses, the likely alternatives to those resources, and the associated  emissions or removals resulting from the use of those alternatives. 20. Where the type(s) of output and/or level(s) of service in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  differ from those in the baseline scenario (e.g., due to diversion of production processes  or outputs), mechanism methodologies shall specify the approach to quantify and subtract  any resulting negative leakage in the calculation of emission reductions and/or net  7 of 8  A6.4-STAN-METH-005 Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  removals. The approach shall ensure that leakage arising from changes in the type(s) of  output and/or level(s) of service is appropriately accounted for.13 21. Article 6.4 activities are ineligible to earn A6.4 emission reductions where the  implementation of the Article 6.4 activity leads to a decrease in the type(s) of output and/or  level(s) of service relative to the baseline scenario, unless the mechanism methodology  fully accounts for any negative leakage effects resulting from the decrease in the type(s)  of output and/or level(s) of service in the calculation of emission reductions and/or net  removals and the proponent of the mechanism methodology provides appropriate  justifications for the full consideration.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 16 May 2025 SBM 016, Annex 13.

Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This Standard sets out requirements for recognizing suppressed demand in mechanism  methodologies. This Standard aims to facilitate a consistent and appropriate consideration  of approaches for addressing suppressed demand. It provides requirements on how to  identify the service level that fulfils basic human needs and identify the baseline  technology and/or practice where suppressed demand exists, and the means to monitor  whether suppressed demand conditions persist during the crediting period. 2. The Standard will be applied by the mechanism methodology proponents developing new  mechanism methodologies or proposing revisions to existing ones, and by the secretariat,  the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) and the Supervisory Body in assessing and  considering proposed mechanism methodologies for approval. The standard is not  intended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or monitoring reports. 1.2. Entry into force 3. This document enters into force on 7 August 2025. 2. Definitions 4. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Activity participant: A public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4  activity;  (b) Basic human needs: Physical and physiological needs considered essential for  minimum quality of life, such as water, food, housing, sanitation (waste  treatment/disposal, and wastewater treatment), access to energy services  (including lighting, cooking, and thermal comforts including heating or cooling),  mobility, communications and education, health and economic activities such as  agriculture;  (c) Business-as-usual (BAU): Plausible reference benchmark or scenario for GHG  emissions or removals prior to or in the absence of the implementation of the  proposed Article 6.4 activity. It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an  emissions or removals intensity;  (d) Level of service: The quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an  Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;  (e) Level of service for meeting basic human needs: The threshold below which  an individual is considered to face deprivation of basic human needs;  (f) Suppressed demand: A situation where services provided to a population are  insufficient to meet the basic human needs due to barriers, such as low income or  lack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting  such needs requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline  scenarios;  3 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (g) Suppressed demand baseline: A crediting baseline that is established for the  provision of services that address basic human needs. 3. Applicability 5. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For  simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to emission reductions. It does  not apply to mechanism methodologies for activities involving removals1. 7. Mechanism methodologies may recognise suppressed demand where:  (a) Neither the existing conditions, nor those in the BAU scenario can realistically  provide the level of service for meeting the basic human needs of a population;  and  (b) These conditions are likely to persist throughout the crediting period due to barriers  such as low income, lack of capital, or inadequate infrastructure. 8. This standard applies to the following contexts:  (a) The residential context, which may include the energy use for lighting, cooking,  food preservation, communication, space heating and cooling; and safe water  supply;  (b) The non-residential context, which may include energy use by smallholder  agriculture (e.g., milling, drying, cold storage); energy for health centres  (e.g., lighting, cold storage, cooking, space heating and cooling); energy for  schools (e.g., lighting, cooking, space heating and cooling, powering of teaching  and learning devices);  (c) Other areas, such as mobility, construction or waste management. 9. This standard provides specifications for the energy consumption to meet basic human  needs for the residential and non-residential sector but does not yet provide specifications  for other areas. Such specifications may be proposed in submissions of mechanism  methodologies. Note that the standard also does not provide values for the level of service  for meeting specific basic human needs in the residential and non-residential context. 10. This standard shall be used in conjunction with the “Standard Setting the baseline in  mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the “Baseline Standard”).2 This  present standard specifies which provisions in the Baseline Standard do not apply to  suppressed demand baselines. 11. The standard applies to activities undertaken at the project level and may be amended in  the future to cover mechanism methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other  scales (e.g., programme-of-activities, policies, sectoral approaches). 1 Stakeholders may identify the need to widen the applicability of this standard to activities involving  removals, by presenting specific proposals for the application of suppressed demand in removals activity  in new proposed mechanism methodologies. 2 Refer A6.4-STAN-METH-004 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-  METH-004.pdf.  4 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 4. General principles and requirements 4.1. General principles 12. The principles in the Baseline Standard shall apply, with an exception to the principle of  conservativeness which is defined as follows:  (a) Conservativeness: In the context of suppressed demand, conservativeness is the  use of data, parameters, assumptions, and methods, to ensure that neither the  baseline emissions nor the level of service for meeting basic human needs are  overestimated. 4.2. Requirements 13. When addressing suppressed demand, the mechanism methodology shall:  (a) Specify which basic human need(s) it addresses and the metric and threshold to  be used for such need(s);  (b) Specify the type(s) of technology and/or practice that will provide the level of  service for meeting basic human needs. 14. The total level of service required to meet basic human needs shall be applied consistently  across countries, regardless of the technology and/or practice that a project activity uses  to address those basic human needs. 5. Approaches for recognising suppressed demand 5.1. Determination of the underlying conditions for recognising suppressed  demand 15. When addressing suppressed demand, the mechanism methodology shall require activity  participants to demonstrate that the intended project beneficiaries are in suppressed  demand conditions with respect to the identified basic human need(s) at the start of each  crediting period and that these conditions are likely to persist throughout the crediting  period. 16. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the sectors and characteristics and scale of the  activity types that they cover for determining a suppressed demand baseline. 5.2. Identification of the level of service for meeting basic human needs 17. Mechanism methodologies shall define the specific context to which the mechanism  methodology is applicable and the level of service for meeting basic human needs for  which a suppressed demand baseline may be applied to calculate baseline emissions.  This applies both when the technology and/or practices provided under the Article 6.4  activity cover one or more basic human need(s). However, the level of service for meeting  basic human needs shall be established separately for each basic human need.  5 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 18. The thresholds for the level of service for meeting basic human needs are defined as:  (a) For suppressed demand in residential energy consumption, the specific basic  human need values shall be derived, and appropriately justified, consistent with  the following threshold values. For total energy consumption:  (i) Total electricity consumption up to 250 kWh per person per year3; and  (ii) For total useful energy delivered from fuel used for cooking and heating up  to 2.1 Gigajoules (equivalent to 583 kWh) per person per year4;  (b) For suppressed demand in non-residential energy consumption, deemed relevant  to meet basic human needs, as described in the definition of basic human needs,  the relevant specific basic human need values shall be derived, and appropriately  justified, consistent with the following threshold value for total direct and indirect  electricity consumption up to 750 kWh per person per year5. 19. The threshold for the level of service for meeting basic human needs, as outlined in  paragraph 18, shall be applied in general as a default approach. Proposals for alternative  values may be included in the mechanism methodology or tool by the methodology  proponents or proposed by a host Party6 for the recommendation by the MEP and approval  by the Supervisory Body. 20. Further, globally applicable values for the level of service for meeting basic human needs  for other areas may be developed in future revisions to this standard. These values may  include the identification and recognition of indirect energy demand for services required  to meet basic human needs in the residential or non-residential context. 21. Mechanism methodologies establishing suppressed demand baselines may use energy  metrics and non-energy metrics to determine the level of service for meeting basic human  needs. Where non-energy metrics are used, the metrics for the level of service for meeting  the basic human needs proposed by proponents of mechanism methodologies shall be  comparable to those in paragraphs 18(a) and 18(b) above. 3 As defined in the Modern Energy Minimum https://modernenergyminimum.org. 4 Adapted from the figure of 50kg-oil equivalent of modern fuel in Level 1 of energy access according to  The Secretary -General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC), 2010, Energy for a  Sustainable Future: Report and Recommendations  https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/publications/AGECCsummaryreport.pdf. 5 As defined in the Modern Energy Minimum https://modernenergyminimum.org. 6 Through the proposal of a standardized baseline.  6 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 22. For establishing the level of service for meeting a specific basic human need, the following  data sources may be used, and it should be demonstrated all data sources are peer  reviewed 7:  (a) National or international research8;  (b) Relevant studies and reports from multilateral organizations9;  (c) Established benchmarks related to international and/or national development  goals10. 23. Further, for establishing the level of service for meeting a specific basic human need, the  following shall be taken into account:  (a) Climatic zones11;  (b) Policy and regulations;  (c) Scale and proportionality to the metric for the total level of service for meeting basic  human needs for the relevant context, as defined under paragraphs 18 and 19  above. 24. In some situations, it may be appropriate to apply two or more baseline technologies  and/or practices and respective service levels to reflect the cumulative project service  level. 25. The level of service for a specific basic human need shall represent a reasonable fraction  of the total level of service for meeting basic human needs for the relevant context, when  it is defined in this standard under paragraph 18 and 19 above. For example, a mechanism  methodology for Article 6.4 activities that provide lighting services for households shall  specify the limit for lighting based on a reasonable and justifiable distribution for different  consumption percentages of the services in the relevant geographical area. 26. The sum of the individual thresholds for each service shall not exceed the threshold for  the total level of service for meeting basic human needs for residential electric energy use,  considering also other electric energy services required by the household to meet its basic  human needs such as space cooling and heating, food preservation and communications.  The same would apply for an Article 6.4 activity that provides combinations of services for 7 In case no peer-review is conducted, it should be demonstrated all data sources have gone through a  similar review process. 8 For example, Table 2 of the following article can be used to estimate the proportions of specific needs  from the value of total Decent Living Standards. The proportions from this source may be considered by  methodology proponents in estimating the proportion of each specific need from the total BHN threshold:  J. Millward-Hopkins, J. K. Steinberger, N. D. Rao, & Y. Oswald, Providing decent living with minimum  energy: A global scenario, Global Environmental Change, Volume 65, 2020.  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102168. 9 For example, The World Health Organization recommendations on per capita safe drinking water  volumes. 10 For example, the DLS framework, IPCC AR6 Chapter 5 Demand, Services and Social Aspects of  Mitigation, pages 505, 506, 513- 522:  https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Chapter05.pdf. 11 As defined by the World Meteorological Organization or a host Party.  7 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  households; in such instances, the mechanism methodology shall specify the threshold  for each service separately that cumulatively meet the threshold for basic human needs.  For example, a mechanism methodology for Article 6.4 activities that provide both lighting  and cooling services for households shall specify the threshold for lighting and the  threshold for cooling separately. 27. For any service provided through the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity beyond the  level of service for meeting basic human needs, the following requirements shall apply:  (a) For the service provided by the Article 6.4 activity up to the threshold level of  service for meeting basic human needs, the mechanism methodology shall require  the determination of a baseline scenario and a baseline technology and/or practice  for that service level in line with the requirements in the section 5.3 of this standard.  The mechanism methodology may use the suppressed demand baseline for the  provision of service up to the threshold for meeting basic human needs;  (b) For the service provided by the Article 6.4 activity that is above the threshold level  of service for meeting basic human needs, the mechanism methodology shall not  determine a suppressed demand baseline, but a) solely use the provisions of the  Baseline Standard to determine the baseline, or b) provide the option to activity  participants that no baseline emissions for the services exceeding the threshold  are considered. 28. During the crediting period, if the baseline for the service exceeding the threshold has not  been determined ex-ante in the PDD of the Article 6.4 activity, and the level of service  provided by the Article 6.4 activity temporarily exceeds the threshold level of service for  meeting basic human needs, then no baseline emissions for service levels exceeding the  threshold level of service shall be considered. 5.3. Identification of the suppressed demand baseline technology and/or practice 29. Mechanism methodologies shall use the provisions in the Baseline Standard to determine  the baseline scenario and the baseline technology and/or practice for the suppressed  demand baseline, subject to the following requirements:  (a) Rather than a service level that reflects existing conditions or a BAU scenario, the  baseline shall be determined for the lower of:  (i) The level of service for meeting basic human needs; or  (ii) The level of service delivered by the mitigation activity;  (b) The identified baseline technology and/or practice shall be able to realistically  provide the level of service referred to in sub-paragraph 29(a)(i) above;  (c) When applying the existing actual or historical emissions approach, the approach  is not required to utilize site-specific historical data but may instead use another  method that reflects the actual or historical emissions of the baseline technology  or practice;  (d) The suppressed demand baseline may be based on a technology and/or practice  that can be demonstrated through studies, documents, or third-party records, but  8 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  is not well documented in official records or data12, whereby the supporting  evidence for the baseline may not comply entirely with the Data requirements for  baseline setting and quantification in the Baseline Standard. The types of alternate  studies, documents, or third-party records permissible as evidence shall be  specified in the mechanism methodology;  (e) The downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3 of the Baseline Standard  may be used as the crediting baseline. The determination of a conservative BAU  baseline, as per Step 3 and section 7 of the Baseline Standard, is not necessary  and the downward adjusted baseline does not need to undergo a comparison with  BAU or fulfil the requirement of being below BAU;  (f) The downward adjustment in subsequent years, as referred to in section 7.2 of the  Baseline Standard, may correspond to the minimum value of 1 per cent;  (g) There is no need for consideration of rebound effects, as referred to in Appendix 1  to the Baseline Standard. 30. The suppressed demand baseline shall be re-evaluated and updated at the renewal of the  crediting period to ensure it is based on the current situation. 5.4. Monitoring of suppressed demand conditions 31. Mechanism methodologies shall include requirements for activity participants to monitor  and reassess whether ongoing conditions continue, to indicate that suppressed demand  would persist in the absence of the Article 6.4 activity, using one or more indicators as  described in sub-paragraph 31(a) below. The mechanism methodology shall specify the  indicator(s) and threshold(s) to be used by activity participants to monitor and reassess  ongoing suppressed demand conditions, as follows:  (a) Indicators may be parameters such as average household income, distance to  electrical substations, grid reliability, distance to water treatment plants in  compliance with potability standards, or others relevant for the basic human needs  being addressed and the conditions of the project population prior to the project  activity;  (b) The monitoring to assess ongoing suppressed demand conditions shall exclude  the direct impact of the Article 6.4 activity on the conditions of the project  population. 32. The mechanism methodology shall include a provision to require activity participants to  undertake the reassessment of ongoing suppressed demand conditions at least every five  years, e.g., at the renewal of the crediting period. 33. If the ongoing conditions of an activity are found to exceed the threshold defined as  meeting suppressed demand, then that location is deemed ineligible for the baseline for  which suppressed demand is recognized, and a new baseline may be proposed following  an approved mechanism methodology via the post-registration changes procedure, as  referred to in the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”.  ----- 12 For example, diesel gensets in a context where these are widely used by individuals but not tracked or  reported reliably by the national government.  9 of 10  A6.4-STAN-METH-006 Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 7 August 2025 SBM 017, Annex 5.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted the rules, modalities and procedures  (RMPs) for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement  (Article 6.4 mechanism)1 In the RMPs, the CMA further requested the Supervisory Body  to establish the requirements and processes necessary to operate the mechanism,  including those relating to the application of robust, social and environmental safeguards  to Article 6.4 activities and/or A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs) and to develop tools  and approaches for assessing and reporting information about how each activity is  fostering sustainable development, while acknowledging that the consideration of  sustainable development is a national prerogative. 2. The RMPs also recalled the eleventh preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement,  “Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should,  when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their  respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of Indigenous  Peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in  vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality,  empowerment of women and intergenerational equity”.2 3. The adoption of the Article 6.4 sustainable development tool (hereinafter referred to as the  A6.4 SD Tool) will necessitate updates to the relevant Article 6.4 standards and  procedures. These updates will ensure alignment with the new A6.4 SD Tool requirements  for reporting, validation and verification. 4. The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism, at its fourteenth meeting (SBM 014),  approved the A6.4 SD Tool. 1.2. Objective 5. The objective of the A6.4 SD Tool is to ensure that Article 6.4 projects and/or Article 6.4  PoAs, collectively referred to as A6.4 activities, uphold the principle of “do no harm”, foster  sustainable development (SD), and contribute to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs).3 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Scope, applicability, and entry into force 2.1. Scope 6. The A6.4 SD Tool applies to all A6.4 activities 4 including all clean development  mechanism (CDM) activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism.  Its scope encompasses the decisions of the CMA, which outline the formal expectations  for the Article 6.4 mechanism, as well as the rules and requirements developed by the  Supervisory Body for operationalizing the mechanism.5 Specifically, the tool provides a  means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory  requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for  assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to SD in line with SD  objectives and priorities of the host Party and the SDGs. 7. To achieve its objective, the tool provides a structured approach for activity participants  to:  (a) Conduct a risk assessment to identify risks and potential impacts, evaluate  them, and avoid harm where possible. When avoidance is not feasible, the A6.4  SD Tool instructs participants to minimize impacts as much as possible and,  finally, to mitigate any remaining negative environmental and social impacts and  risks by establishing activity-level environmental and social indicators;  (b) Identify and assess potential positive and negative impacts on the 17  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and host Party SD priorities and  establish activity-level SD monitoring indicators;  (c) Monitor and report the outcomes of the monitoring against the established  activity-level environmental and social indicators and activity-level SD indicators. 2.2. Applicability 8. The use of the A6.4 SD Tool is mandatory for all proposed A6.4 activities, including all  CDM activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2.3. Entry into force 9. Version 01.0 of the A.6.4 SD Tool enters into force on 9 October 2024. This document  shall be reviewed every 18 months. 4 In addition to this general tool, additional safeguards criteria and guiding questions to be applied for  carbon dioxide removal activities and for land use, land-use change and forestry activities will be  developed by the Supervisory Body as new annexes to include in this SD Tool at an appropriate stage  in its development of regulations for activities involving removals. 5 See Decision and documentation framework (A6.4-INFO-GOV-005) available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-005.pdf.  5 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 3. Article 6.4 Sustainable Development Tool  implementation 3.1. Overview of the A6.4 SD Tool 10. The A6.4 SD Tool requires activity participants to identify, evaluate, avoid, minimize, and  mitigate potential risks associated with proposed A6.4 activities. 11. Activity participants of A6.4 activities shall adopt mitigation strategies to avoid risks or,  where complete avoidance is not possible and activity implementation is nonetheless  permitted, minimize and mitigate identified risks. 12. Where complete avoidance of risk is not possible, activity participants of A6.4 activities  shall provide evidence, including monitoring of activity-level environmental and social  indicators, that the A6.4 activities comply with the environmental and social safeguarding  elements and criteria as defined in section 6 of this tool, including those relevant to the  eleventh preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement, 6 as well as relevant and  applicable national and international instruments to which the host Party is bound and  applicable legislation in the host Party (see figures 1 and 2). Such international instruments  may include, for example, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the  International Labour Organization fundamental conventions, and recognized international  best practices. 13. Activity participants are also required to:  (a) Identify and assess the potential positive and negative impacts of their A6.4  activities on the SD of the host Party(ies), by considering the host Party(ies)’ SD  objectives and priorities, as well as the SDGs;  (b) Establish activity-level SD indicators; and  (c) Monitor and report the outcome against the established indicators (see figures 1  and 3 and section 7.1). 3.2. Navigating the A6.4 SD Tool 14. The A6.4 SD Tool is divided into three key sections covering important processes, as  follows:  (a) Section 6 Environmental and social safeguards: 7 This section focuses on  elements and criteria that serve as the basis for activity participants to identify,  evaluate, avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative environmental and  social impacts and risks that may arise during the implementation and operation  of the A6.4 activity, or CDM activity transitioning the Article 6.4 mechanism.  Activity participants are required to conduct a risk assessment based on  safeguards’ elements and criteria as defined under Section 6, which leads to the  development of A6.4 Environmental and social management action plans. These  plans include activity-level environmental and social indicators for tracking  actions and acceptance criteria to demonstrate that the impacts and risks do not 6 See footnote 2. 7 Environmental and social safeguards commonly observed in other UN agencies, international financial  institutions and voluntary carbon market systems.  6 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  cause harm to the environment or society. The outcomes of the risk assessment  and the plans shall be documented in:  (i) A6.4-FORM-AC-015: A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form. This form records the identification, evaluation, and  avoidance of environmental and/or social risks that may be caused by a  proposed A6.4 activity;  (ii) A6.4-FORM-AC-016: A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form. This form details the set of minimization and mitigation measures and  monitoring to be implemented. It shall be completed if the conclusion of the  A6.4-FORM-AC-015 is “Yes” or “Potentially” (see figure 1 and figure 2).  (b) Section 7. Sustainable development impacts: This section focuses on  identifying the positive and negative SD impacts of the A6.4 activity, or a CDM  activity transitioning to the Article 6.4 mechanism. It outlines the processes for  the assessment of the SDGs impacted, the consideration of the host countries’  SD objectives and priorities, and the establishment of activity-level SD monitoring  indicators based on the SDGs and their targets. All activity participants shall  document the evaluation of SD impacts and the measuring, monitoring and  reporting methodology in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017: A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form (see figure 1 and figure 3);  (c) Sections 8 and 9. Validation and Verification: These sections outline additional  requirements to the Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standards  for projects and programmes of activities (VVS-P - VVS-PoA) 8 that shall be  considered by the designated operational entities (DOEs) during the validation  and verification stages. 3.3. Stakeholder engagement and the A6.4 SD Tool 15. Stakeholders may submit issues and comments related to compliance with the A6.4 SD  Tool during the local stakeholder consultation and the global stakeholder consultation prior  to the registration of the A6.4 activity.9 16. During the local stakeholder consultation, the three completed A6.4 SD Tool forms (see  sub-paragraphs 14(a) through (b)) shall be shared with stakeholders by the activity  participants.10 Further, during the global stakeholder consultation, Parties, stakeholders  and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations may submit comments on the three  completed A6.4 SD Tool forms. Any inputs received or issues raised by stakeholders  during these consultations shall be considered by activity participants for revising or  updating A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017. The  stakeholder inputs received and the revised forms shall then be submitted to a DOE for  validation.11 17. After the registration of the A6.4 activity under the Article 6.4 mechanism, activity  participants shall establish and maintain a continuous engagement mechanism for 8 See section 4: Normative references. 9 In accordance with sections 6.9 and 6.10 of Article 6.4 activity standard. 10 In accordance with host Party rules and/or section 6.9 and Appendix 2 of Article 6.4 mechanism activity  standards. 11 In accordance with section 4.6.1 of Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedures.  7 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  stakeholders to comment on compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool until the end of the valid  crediting period of the project.12 Activity participants, DOEs and the secretariat will make  their documents publicly available through their respective activity view pages hosted on  the UNFCCC website.13 12 As defined in section 7.1 of Article 6.4 activity standard, and appeal and grievance processes under the  Article 6.4 mechanism. 13 In accordance with section 6 to section 8 of Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure.  8 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 Figure 1.

Element 8: Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement46  E8 description: 71. The Article 6.4 activity avoids involuntary resettlement. The A6.4 activity supports the  avoidance of activity-related land acquisition and restrictions on land use that lead to  adverse impacts on communities and persons, including physical displacement  (relocation, loss of residential land or loss of shelter) and economic displacement (loss of  land, assets, or access to assets, leading to loss of income sources or other means of  livelihood). Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, it is to be minimized, and  appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts on displaced persons (and on host  communities receiving displaced persons) are to be carefully consulted, planned and  implemented.  E8 criteria: 72. E8.1: In the implementation of the 6.4 activity, activity participants of the A6.4 activity are  to avoid involuntary resettlement. 73. E8.2: When physical displacement (i.e., relocation or loss of shelter) cannot be avoided,  activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to mitigate the displacement impacts on, and  risks for, displaced persons and host communities to, at minimum, restore their livelihoods  and/or living standards to pre-project levels. If the A6.4 activity involves Indigenous  Peoples, their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)47 must be obtained in accordance  with Element 9, included in section 6.4.6 of and in particular with criteria E9.5. 74. E8.3: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to mitigate impacts and risks of economic  displacement (loss of land, assets, or access to assets, leading to loss of income sources  or other means of livelihood), when economic displacement cannot be avoided. 75. E8.4: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to conduct a census and a socioeconomic  baseline survey to identify all affected individuals, groups or communities that will be  physically or economically displaced. A resettlement and/or livelihood action plans are to  be integrated into A6.4-FORM-AC-016 (see figure 1) where physical displacement is  involved. The action plan will be developed in accordance with international best practices  (e.g. United Nations Development Programme Standard 5: Displacement and  Resettlement 48), in full consultation with the affected individuals, groups or communities  and based on good-faith negotiations. Resettlement understandings reached by the  activity participants with affected individuals, groups or communities are to be reflected in  written agreements. 46 Involuntary resettlement refers to a scenario when affected persons or communities do not have the right  to refuse land acquisition or restrictions on land use that result in displacement. 47 FPIC is a specific right of Indigenous Peoples recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights  of Indigenous Peoples. FPIC allows Indigenous Peoples to engage in negotiations to shape the design,  implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the activity.

This is to be undertaken  through good-faith negotiations in a manner that is culturally appropriate and inclusive,  and that does not impede land rights or equal access to basic services, including health  services, clean water, energy, education, safe and decent working conditions, and  housing. 6.4.7. Element 10: Corruption52  E10 description: 84. The A6.4 activity ensures the avoidance, prevention, and detection of corruption, and  responds to corruption or corruption attempts during activity design, development,  implementation and operation. To ensure this, activity participants of the A6.4 activity  recognize that corruption negatively impacts every aspect of society by diverting essential  resources needed to alleviate poverty, enhance health outcomes, and provide children  with quality education. 6.4.8. Element 11: Cultural heritage53  E11 description: 85. The A6.4 activity avoids impacts on cultural heritage. When avoidance of impacts is not  possible, activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to identify and implement measures  to address impacts on cultural heritage by completing A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan (see figure 1).  E11 criteria: 86. E11.1: The A6.4 activity does not cause or contribute to the alteration, damage, or removal  of any sites, objects, or structures of critical cultural heritage. 87. E11.2: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are responsible for designing the activity to  avoid significant adverse impacts on cultural heritage. The environmental and social risk  impact assessment should determine whether the proposed location of an activity is in  areas where cultural heritage is expected to be found during implementation or operations.  Activity participants of the A6.4 activity will not proceed with the activity until an  assessment by professionals and/or entities recognized by the host government,  academia and/or the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  (UNESCO)54 is made to ensure that no adverse impacts on cultural heritage will occur. If  the A6.4 activity involves Indigenous Peoples, FPIC must be obtained in accordance with  Element 9, included in section 6.4.6 of and in particular with P9.5 criteria. 52 Please refer to the paragraph 23(e). 53 See footnote 50. 54 UNESCO expert facility.

Step 1: Identify SD objectives and priorities of host Party (see figure 1)  (a) Activity participants shall identify the host Party’s SD objectives and priorities,  which may include national strategies for SD and/or SDG achievement, SDG  national targets and indicators, and economic, social and environmental  indicators related to the A6.4 activity;  (b) If the host Party defines national strategies for SD, SDG achievement, or SDG  national targets and indicators relevant to section 6.3.6 of the A6.4 activity,  activity participants shall explicitly identify any SDG-specific objectives and  priorities in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017;  (c) Activity participants shall also identify any host Party objectives and priorities that  are not clearly responsive to any SDG in the same form. 91. Step 2: Assess impacted SDGs (see figures 1 and 3)  (a) The “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and  targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”57 provides 17 SDGs,  169 targets and 249 indicators, which must be consulted by activity participants  when identifying the impacted SDGs;  (b) Activity participants shall identify the SDGs that the A6.4 activity directly impacts  positively and/or negatively. Activity participants shall provide justification for any  excluded SDGs, considering the SD objectives and priorities of the host Party,  including those described above and the criteria defined in paragraph 95(c) below  (see figures 1 and 3);  (c) Impacts on the SDGs and their goals shall: 55 Cultural heritage is preserved, protected, and promoted in mitigation activities in a manner consistent  with UNESCO Cultural Heritage conventions or any other national or international legal instruments that  might have a bearing on the use of cultural heritage. 56 Direct impact: an impact based on direct contribution or interaction by an activity with an environmental,  social, or economic component during the implementation and operation, and if applicable dismantling. 57 The latest “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development” is available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-  list/ in six official languages of the United Nations.  27 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  (i) Be relevant to the A6.4 activity type;  (ii) Result in a direct impact (i.e., the A6.4 activity is the main driver of change);  (iii) Be recurring/lasting during the crediting period of the A6.4 activity and impact  the stakeholders and/or local environment in a direct and measurable way;  (d) Once activity participants identify SDGs impacted by the A6.4 activity, they are  required to:  (i) Review the respective targets defined under the identified SDGs from the  latest “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and  targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”;  (ii) Select target(s) under the SDGs based on the criteria defined in the paragraph  95(c) above;  (iii) Review indicators defined under the selected target(s) within the identified  SDGs and select relevant indicator(s). Since these indicators are defined at  regional and national levels, activity participants shall develop their own  activity-level SD indicators, as per step 3 below. 92. Step 3: Establish A6.4 activity-level SD indicators (see figures 1 and 3)  (a) Activity participants shall establish A6.4 activity-level SD indicators for each  identified direct impact to the SDG resulting from the activity, taking into  consideration the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators. All relevant SDG  targets and corresponding indicators for each SDG should be chosen (see figures  1 and 3, and table 3 below);  (b) When activity participants identify negative impacts on any of the 17 SDGs, they  should refer to the outcomes of the risk assessment (see Section 6 above, Steps  1 and 2);  (c) If the identified negative impacts on the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators  are already considered in A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016, activity  participants do not need to establish relevant activity-level SD indicator(s);  (d) If the identified negative impacts on the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators  are not already considered in A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016,  activity participants are required to establish relevant activity-level SD indicator(s)  to minimize and mitigate the identified negative impacts. Where complete  avoidance of identified negative impact is not possible, activity participants shall  provide evidence, including monitoring of activity-level SD indicators, that the  A6.4 activities align with host Party legislation. 93. A6.4 Activity-level SD indicator(s) can be qualitative or quantitative and shall be  monitorable over the crediting period. The A6.4 activity-level SD indicator(s) shall:  (a) Be in line with the objectives and intent of the SDGs and their corresponding  targets;  (b) Be directly impacted by the activity; 58 58 See footnote 56.  28 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  (c) Not be a one-off occurrence;  (d) Include the monitoring approach and parameters, including the frequency of  monitoring, to be used for each selected activity-level SDG target indicator defined  in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017.

Monitoring procedures for A6.4 activity-level SD indicators 94. Activity participants shall describe in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017 the monitoring procedures  of A6.4 activity-level SD indicators, including:  (a) The A6.4 activity-level SD indicators, including selected SDGs, SDG targets and  SDG indicators;  (b) Data unit and source of data;  (c) Information on monitoring/measurement procedures/methods;  (d) Monitoring frequency (at least annual). 95. Based on the requirements specified in the regulations listed under Section 4: Normative  references, sub-paragraphs (b) through (g), once activity participants complete the A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 reflecting inputs received or issues raised by stakeholders during local and  global stakeholder consultations, the outcome (including the form) must be shared with  the DOE performing validation. 96. Once the A6.4 activity is registered, activity participants shall monitor and report the  outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level SD indicators in the monitoring report, as per the  A6.4-FORM-AC-017. A DOE is required to verify the monitoring of the indicators during  each request for issuance of A6.4 ERs. 8. Validation 97. The requirements for validation of A6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4 validation  and verification standards for projects and PoAs.59 98. The DOE shall validate the appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of the information  provided in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016, and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as  reported in the project design document by:  (a) Step1: reviewing stakeholder consultation documents [inputs/comments];  (b) Step 2: conducting interviews with local stakeholders;  (c) Step 3: reviewing relevant host party documentation;  (d) Step 4: providing a validation opinion employing professional judgement and as  per A6.4 validation and verification standard for projects and PoAs. 99. The DOE shall validate:  (a) Both quantitative and qualitative information provided, to assess the adequacy of  the identification of environmental and/or social risks caused by the A6.4 activity.  The validation should be done by taking the four steps referred to in paragraph  97 above, in order to:  (i) Validate the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan presented in A6.4-  FORM-AC-015, as per the provision referred to in paragraph 12; 59 See Section 4: Normative references.  31 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  (ii) Validate that the activity-level environmental and social indicators defined in  the A6.4 environmental and social safeguards risk assessment ensure that the  A6.4 activities do not cause harm, to the environment and stakeholders.  (b) That the outcome of A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016, and A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 have been shared during the local stakeholder consultation and  that inputs received from the consultation are reflected in the completed form;  (c) That there is an established continuous engagement of local stakeholders in  accordance with the AS-P or the AS-PoA;60  (d) The appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of the information provided in  the A6.4-FORM-AC-017 by taking the four steps referred to in paragraph 97  above in order to:  (i) Validate that the SD objectives and/or criteria of the host Party documented in  A6.4-FORM-AC-017 are in line with the host Party’s definition (when  available);  (ii) Validate that the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-  017 are universally applicable to the activity type and significant,  recurring/lasting for at least the entire crediting period of the A6.4 activity, and  impacting the primary stakeholders and/or local environment in a direct and  measurable way, resulting in a primary benefit;  (iii) Validate that the description of A6.4 activity-level SD indicators is accurately  reflected in A6.4-FORM-AC-017. 100. The DOE shall provide a validation opinion stating that, based on A6.4-FORM-AC-016  and A6.4-FORM-AC-017, the A6.4 activity results in no harm and contributes to SD. 101. If the DOE identifies the presence of unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the  environmental and social safeguards elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by  consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative validation opinion as per the  A6.4 validation and verification standard61 or submit a deviation request to the Supervisory  Body prior to submitting a request for registration. Box 1 below contains a best practice  example of validation. 60 Ibid. 61 See paragraph 64 of VVS-P and paragraph 160 of VVS-PoA.  32 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  Box 1. Best practice example of validation  A proposed activity is to distribute energy-efficient appliances to households in coastal  and peninsular areas. An activity participant identifies that their activity contributes to  SDG 1462 and SDG 1563 based on the location of the proposed activity, which is near to  the marine and forest ecosystem. During the validation, the DOE raises a corrective action  request (CAR) asking the activity participants to clarify how the proposed activity’s  impact on SDG 14 and SDG 15 is direct and primary, as per section 7.1 of the applied tool.  The activity participants acknowledge that their activity does not directly contribute to  SDG 14 and SDG 15 and excludes these contributions to SDG 14 and SDG 15 from A6.4-  FORM-AC-017. Based on this revision, the DOE closes its CAR accordingly. 9. Verification 102. The requirements relating to the verification for A 6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4  validation and verification standards for projects and PoAs.64. The DOE shall verify the  appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of information provided in the monitoring of  the environmental and social indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4 activity-level SD  indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as reported in a monitoring report. 103. If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 that were validated at the registration, it will provide its verification opinion  on the observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and  environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-  016 and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 104. The DOE shall review any input and comments received via continuous engagement of  local stakeholders in accordance with the AS-P or AS-PoA,65 conduct interviews with local  stakeholders, and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post  fulfilment of risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity. 105. The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and  reported parameters established in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017  submitted at the registration stage. 106. If the DOE identifies unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the parameters  established in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 and cannot be remediated  by consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion as per  the A6.4 validation and verification standard or submit a deviation request to the  Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance. Box 2 below contains a best  practice example of verification. 62 SDG 14 (life below water) is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources  for sustainable development. (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14) 63 SDG 15 (life on land) is protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,  sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt  biodiversity loss (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15). 64 See Section 4: Normative references. 65 Ibid.  33 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  Box 2. Best practice example of verification  Activity participants identify the A6.4 activity’s contribution to SDG 866 based on jobs  generated from the proposed activity and include the number of generated jobs in A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 as a monitoring indicator. During the verification of the number of jobs  generated under SDG 8, a DOE identifies that the number includes short-term  construction phase jobs and raises a CAR asking activity participants to clarify how the  inclusion of short-term construction phase jobs aligns with section 7.1 of the applied tool,  which requires SD impact to be significant and recurring/lasting for at least the entire  crediting period of the activity. The activity participants acknowledge that the inclusion  of short-term construction phase jobs is not in line with the SD impact defined in section  7.1 of the applied tool, and the DOE closes the CAR by verifying a revised number that  does not include short-term construction phase jobs. 66 SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) is to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic  growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8).  34 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 Guiding questions for the risk assessment of the  environmental and social safeguards elements  and criteria Instruction 1.
