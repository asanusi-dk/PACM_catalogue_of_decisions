II.A below); \n\n(b)  Adopt  the  draft  rules  of  procedure of  the  Supervisory  Body  as  contained  in \n\nannex I (see para. 10 below); \n\n(c) \n\nAdopt  the  levels  for  the  share  of  proceeds  for  administrative  expenses  as \n\ncontained in annex II (see para. 11 below); \n\n(d) \n\nRequest the secretariat to take the necessary steps to establish a separate trust \nfund  for  the  receipt  of  fees,  shares  of  proceeds  for  the  administration  of  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism and other contributions (see para. 33 below). \n\nII.  Work in the reporting period \n\n7. \nThe final nominations to the Supervisory Body were received in June 2022, enabling \nits  1st  meeting  to  be  held  at  the  end  of  July  2022.  In  the  initial  phase  of  its  work  the \nSupervisory  Body  focused  on  putting \ninstitutional  foundations  for \noperationalizing  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  including  preparing  its  recommendations  for \nCMA 4 as a priority (on rules of procedure, share of proceeds and methodological issues) \nand planning its future work. \n\nin  place \n\nthe \n\n1   Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. \n2  https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-64-mechanism. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n\fFCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6 \n\n8. \nTo make best use of the limited time left in 2022, the Supervisory Body agreed to hold \nthree in-person meetings between July and November. In addition, informal working groups \ncomposed  of  Supervisory  Body  members  and  alternate  members  and  secretariat  staff \nadvanced  work  between  meetings.  This  enhanced  engagement  by  the  Supervisory  Body \nenabled work to be fast-tracked. \n\nA.

In doing so, due care was taken to ensure that funds \nraised  from  the  share  of  proceeds  for  administrative  expenses  will  balance  with  expected \nexpenditure,  including  appropriate  operating  reserve,  and  that  the  levels  of  the  share  of \nproceeds  for  administrative  expenses  do  not  discourage  participation  in  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism, noting that the levels are to be reviewed periodically in accordance with decision \n3/CMA.3,  paragraph 8.  The Supervisory  Body  agreed  to  indicate  to  the  CMA  that  it  will \ndetermine  a  specific  level  for  each  fee  type  included  in  the  recommendation  within  the \nmaximum  level  therein  when  developing  procedures  for  processing  requests  within  the \nactivity cycle under the Article 6.4 mechanism, with the intention to set the fee levels low \nwhere appropriate. \n\n12. \nIn  addition,  the  Supervisory  Body  agreed  on  the  level  and  process  for  monetary \ncontributions  from  individual  Article  6.4  mechanism  activities  to  the  Adaptation  Fund  in \naccordance  with  the  rules,  modalities  and  procedures  for  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,6  as \nfollows, which may be modified by the Supervisory Body in future on the basis of its review \nof the implementation of the provision: 3 per cent of the issuance fee paid for each request \nfor issuance of A6.4ERs shall be deducted and the total transferred annually to the Adaptation \nFund.  \n\n13. \nFurthermore, the Supervisory Body agreed that the level and frequency of the periodic \ncontribution from the remaining funds received from the share of proceeds for administrative \nexpenses to the Adaptation Fund, after setting aside the operating costs for the mechanism \nand  an  operating  reserve  in  accordance  with  the  rules,  modalities  and  procedures  for  the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism,7 should not be decided at this stage but determined on the basis of an \nannual review of the status of those funds. \n\n14. \nThe  Supervisory  Body  worked  on  elaborating  a  recommendation  for  the  CMA  on \nactivities  involving  removals.8  It  will  continue  the  work  at  its  3rd  meeting  and  report  on \nprogress in the addendum to this report.  \n\n15. \nThe Supervisory Body also worked on elaborating a recommendation for the CMA \non the application of the requirements referred to in chapter V.B of the  annex to decision \n\n3  See decision 3/CMA.3, para. 6.  \n4  As per decision 3/CMA.3, para. 6(a).  \n5  As per decision 3/CMA.3, para. 6(b).   \n6  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, para. 67(b).  \n7  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, para. 67(c).  \n8  As per decision 3/CMA.3, para. 6(c).   \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6 \n\n3/CMA.3.9 It will continue the work at its 3rd meeting and report on progress in the addendum \nto this report. \n\n16. \nThe plans for implementing the mandates10 that do not have a specific delivery date \nand guide the operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism are included in the Supervisory \nBody’s workplan for 2022–2023,11 agreed at its 2nd meeting, which translates the mandates \ninto  activities,  approaches  and/or  products  that  the  Body  is  working  on  for  delivery  after \nCMA 4: \n\n(a) \nstandard; \n\nDeveloping activity standards and procedures, and a validation and verification \n\n(b) \n\nReviewing  methodologies,  standardized  baselines,  methodological  tools  and \nguidelines related to the CDM and other market-based mechanisms as a basis for developing \nstandards  for  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  and  establishing  procedures  for  developing \nmethodologies and standardized baselines; \n\n(c) \n\nReviewing the sustainable development tool used under the CDM and other \n\nsimilar tools; \n\n(d) \n\nReviewing  the  CDM  accreditation  standards  and  procedures  with  a  view  to \n\napplying them with revisions, as appropriate, for the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n17.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism \nestablished  by Article  6, paragraph  4, of the Paris Agreement  (Article 6.4 mechanism)  to \nensure  transparency  of decision-making  and  make publicly  available  its decision-making \nframework  and decisions,  including standards,  procedures  and related  documents.1 \n\nThis document addresses the mandate of the CMA. It will be updated, as required, should \nchanges  to  the  classes  of  decisions  and  types  of  documents  be  requested  by  the \nSupervisory  Body. \n\n1.2.

Decision hierarchy between the CMA and the Supervisory \n\nBody \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nThe  CMA  is  the  ultimate  decision-making  body  of  the  Article  6.4  mechanism.  The  CMA \nhas  authority  over  and provides  guidance  to  the Supervisory  Body  through  the  adoption \nof decisions, which are published in reports of the CMA. The decisions of the CMA outline \nformal  expectations  with  respect  to  the  Article  6.4  mechanism.  They  set  direction  and \nestablish  precedents  which  serve  as  reference  for  future  decision-making  and  the basis \nfor operationalizing  the Article  6.4 mechanism.  CMA decisions  are treated  as mandatory \nrequirements  or  rules  intended  to  ensure  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Paris \nAgreement.2 \n\nThe Supervisory  Body  is the regulatory  body of the  Article  6.4 mechanism.  Acting under \nthe authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory \nBody  has  authority  over  and  provides  guidance  to  the  activities  and  processes  of  the \nArticle  6.4 mechanism.  All  decisions  taken  by the  Supervisory  Body elaborate  upon  and \nmust be consistent  with decisions of the CMA. \n\nDecisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded  in the meeting reports of the Supervisory \nBody  and  their  accompanying  annexes,  which  together  form  the  official  record  of  the \nproceedings  of  the  Supervisory  Body  meetings.  The  authoritative  set  of  documents \ncontaining regulatory  decisions is published  in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of \nthe United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  website. \n\n4.  Supervisory Body decision classes \n\n8. \n\nTaking into account both the rule-making and rule-enforcing roles of the Supervisory Body, \ndecisions of the Supervisory  Body are divided into three classes: \n\n(a) \n\nRegulatory  decisions:  relate  to  the  adoption  of,  or  revision  to,  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism  rules  and  requirements  developed  under  the  direction  of  the \nSupervisory  Body,  to  be  followed  by  the  Supervisory  Body,  its  support  structure \nand  stakeholders.3  Regulatory  decisions  are  reflected  in  the  adoption  of,  or \nrevisions \n(including  policy  standards,  methodologies  and \nstandardized  baselines),  procedures,  tools  (including  policy  and  methodological \ntools),  guidelines  and  clarifications \n(including  policy  and  methodological \nclarifications),  as  recorded  in  and/or  annexed  to  the  meeting  reports  of  the \nSupervisory  Body; \n\nto,  standards \n\n2  The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted  by 196 \nParties at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris, on 12 December and entered \ninto force on 4 November 2016.

The CMA  requested  the Supervisory \nBody  to  consider  and  further  develop  various  elements  in  the  rules,  modalities  and \nprocedures  for its operationalization. \n\nThe Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol \n(CMP) decided, through its decision 2/CMP.16,3 to authorize the transfer of USD 30 million \nfrom  the  Trust  Fund  for  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  to  the  Trust  Fund  for \nSupplementary  Activities  to  facilitate  the  expedited  implementation  of  the  Article 6.4 \nmechanism  by the Supervisory  Body. \n\nThe  Resource  Allocation  Plan  2024–2025  (RAP 2024–2025)  provides  an  estimated \nbudget  for  the  Supervisory  Body  to  carry  out  its  work  in  2024–2025  as  specified  in  its \nworkplan,  as  well  as  other  activities  deemed  essential  to  operationalize  the  Article 6.4 \nmechanism. \n\n2.  Strategic vision and goals \n\n5. \n\nThe  strategic  vision  of  the  Supervisory  Body  is  to  provide  a  mechanism  that  actively \ncontributes  to  the  global  mitigation  of  emissions  and  sustainable  development,  as \nmandated in Article 6, paragraph  4, of the Paris Agreement. It aims do this through a high-\nquality,  robust,  and  inclusive  multilateral  crediting  mechanism  that  demonstrates  the \nhighest environmental  integrity  standards and by aiming to become a benchmark-setter. \n\n6. \n\nTo  support  the  achievement  of  the  RAP 2024–2025,  the  Supervisory  Body  will  strive  to \naccomplish  the goals described  in the following: \n\n1  Paris  Agreement  available  at:  https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-\n\nchange-conference-november-2015/paris-agreement. \n\n2  See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 (decision 3/CMA.3) available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/documents/460950. \n\n3  See document FCCC/KP/CMP/2021/8/Add.1 (decision 2/CMP.16) available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/documents/460957. \n\n3 of 18 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-007  \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025 \nVersion 01.0 \n\n2.1   Goal  1:  Facilitate  the  implementation  of  mitigation  activities  through  the \nprompt operationalization of the  Article 6.4  mechanism  by  developing  and \nadopting efficient and effective procedures, processes and infrastructure \n\n7. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory  Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nOperate  efficient  activity  assessment  processes  with  a  focus  on  meeting  all \ntimelines without  compromising  the quality of assessments; \n\nOperate  an  effective  accreditation  framework  through  the  development  of \naccreditation  standards  and  procedures  that  are  clear  and  easy  to  apply  while \nensuring  the  broadest  possible  regional  availability  of  designated  operational \nentities (DOEs); \n\nProvide effective  and user-friendly  infrastructure  that facilitates the participation  of \npublic  and  private  entities  in  the  mitigation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by \nenabling access  and ease of use; \n\nContinuously  review and improve the procedures,  processes and infrastructure  for \nthe  Article 6.4 mechanism  in a  nimble  manner  as both  a  driver  of innovation  and \nby being responsive to innovation and best practices as they emerge in the carbon \ncredit markets. \n\n2.2   Goal  2:  Set  the  global  benchmark  for  high  environmental  integrity in  the \n\nquantification of mitigation outcomes from activities \n\n8. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory  Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nOperate an effective methodology  development  process that supports  the needed \ntransformational  change,  and  facilitate  the  achievement  of  ambitious  emission \nreductions  and enhancements  of long-term removals; \n\nEngage  the  best  expert  knowledge  by  applying  a  science-  and  evidence-based \napproach; \n\nEnsure  transparent  and  inclusive  processes  for  the  engagement  of stakeholders \nand local communities; \n\nTake  a  leading  role  in  the  discussions  on  environmental  integrity  standards  for \ncarbon crediting through  outreach and engagement  with other crediting  standards \nand initiatives. \n\n2.3   Goal  3:  Enable  Party  and  non-Party  stakeholders  to  understand  and \n\nparticipate in the Article 6.4 mechanism \n\n9. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory  Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nSupport \nthe  highest  quality  of  submissions  through  the  development  and \nstrengthening  of designated  national  authorities,  DOEs,  activity  participants,  and \nother stakeholders’ capacity and skills regarding the requirements  of the Article 6.4 \nmechanism;

The  purpose  of TCO charges  is to  ensure  the  allocation  of costs  of these  support \nservices  to  the  sources  of funding  to  which they  relate.  In  2024  and  2025,  the  TCO charge  per  capita  of EUR \n15,460  will be applied. \n\n(k)  Engagement  agreement  (Information Technology)  includes  IT-related  costs to support  the implementation  of the \nResource Allocation  Plan,  including  the development  and operation  of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism information system. \n\n(l)  Programme support  costs (PSC) – In accordance with the financial procedures  of the United  Nations,  13 per cent \nof  overhead  charges  are  payable  on  all  trust  funds  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange  (UNFCCC) to  cover  administrative  services  provided  by the  United  Nations  Office at  Geneva  and  the \nUNFCCC secretariat. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\nFor 2024 and 2025, the estimate for staffing  needs are 52 staff and 63 staff, respectively. \nThe increase  in proposed  staff costs,  compared  to the indicative  budgets,  mainly reflects \nthe  rise  in  statutory  costs.  The  secretariat  applies  the  United  Nations  rules  governing \nsalaries and employee benefits. Salary and common costs for staff on fixed-term contracts \nare  calculated  using  standard  rates  for  each  grade.  The  United  Nations  Framework \nConvention  on Climate  Change  rates  are determined  based  on a historical  analysis  of a \nset of staff cost parameters  such as pay scales and employee benefits.  This resulted  in a \nchange in standard salary staff rates for all levels. \n\nThe consultants cost category  in the budget  proposals is indicative. \n\nThe increase in travel of representatives  is primarily  due to the addition of costs related to \nthe participation of representatives  in the designated  national authority  regional forums. \n\nThe  increase  in  travel  of  representatives  —  Supervisory  Body  is  due  to  the  addition  of \ncosts related to the participation  of two members to the Regional  Climate Weeks. \n\n11. \n\nThe increase in the travel of staff budget also reflects a general increase  in travel costs. \n\n12. \n\nThe increase in operating  expenses is due to additional costs for regional forums. \n\n13. \n\nThe training cost category in the budget proposals  is indicative. \n\n14. \n\nThe  increased  engagement  agreement  (IT)  cost  category  in  the  budget  proposals, \ncompared  to the indicative  budgets, reflects  the development  cost of IT systems  such as \nthe  development  and operation  of the  Article  6.4 mechanism  registry  and  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism  information system. IT development  costs for 2024–2025  are initial estimates \n\n17 of 18 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-007  \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025 \nVersion 01.0 \n\nand  are  likely  to  increase  during  2024–2025,  taking  into  account  increased  clarity  on \nbusiness  requirements  (scope  and  scale  of  development  needed),  and  may  require \nbudget adjustments. \n\n4. \n\nEnsuring  the prudent management  of resources \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\nThe  secretariat  prudently  manages  and  monitors  resource  allocations  against  priority \nareas of work to ensure the optimal use of available staff in delivering high-quality products \non time. \n\nA total of 52 posts are included  in the RAP for 2024, and 63 posts are included  for 2025, \ncompared  to  33  posts  in  2023.

It has \nbeen developed within the context of the Article 6.4 mechanism’s two-year business and \nresource allocation plan 2024–2025.1 The workplan includes routine operational activities \nas well as mandates from the Supervisory Body. \n\nThe AEP workplan for 2025 was approved by the Supervisory Body (refer to annex 3 of \nSBM  015  meeting  report).  The  AEP  co-chairs  have  agreed  to  cancel  the  virtual  AEP \nmeeting  (AEP  004),  which  was  tentatively  scheduled  for  15  April  2025.

At SB 011, the \nSupervisory Body took note of the report from AEP 001, which included the selection of the ARoE. \n\nAccording to paragraph 32 of the report of the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body, 30 clean development mechanism (CDM) designated operational \nentities (DOEs) are authorized to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism. Three \nCDM DOEs withdrew their CDM accreditation status after the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body; therefore, 27 CDM DOEs are allowed to verify and \ncertify transitioned CDM activities and their current status has been updated on the Article 6.4 public website. A total of 14 applications for initial accreditation \nunder the Article 6.4 mechanism were received and are currently undergoing processing in accordance with the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation \nprocedure8 adopted at SB 008. Overall, 41 entities are under administration, which is higher than the forecasted value due to the implementation of the SB \n008 decision which authorized 30 CDM DOEs to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities to the Article 6.4 \nmechanism without conducting an accreditation assessment. Due to the same decision, the actual value of assessment planning is 14 which is less than the \nforecasted value. During the reporting period, there were no complaints or requests for review raised in accordance with the Article 6.4 accreditation \nprocedure. \n\nThe DOE performance monitoring procedure was considered at AEP 002 and subsequently adopted at SBM 014.9  Therefore, the performance monitoring \nsystem will be implemented once submissions are received. \n\n8  Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation (A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001) available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf. \n\n9  At SB 011, the Supervisory Body adopted ‘SBM’ (with \"M\" signifying \"of the Mechanism\") to refer to its meetings. \n\n5 of 40 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-023 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024) \nVersion 01.0 \n\nTable 2. \n\nEntity assessment  \n\nOutputs \n\nGoals   Activities \n\nUnits \n\nForecasted \nvolume \n\nActual volume \n\nApproved non-\nstaff costs \n(USD) \n\nActual \n\n2024 \n\nDecember 2024  2024 \n\nDecember 2024 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\nPerformance assessments \n(validation and verification) \nRegular surveillance and \nspot checks \n\nAssessments \n\nAssessments \n\nRequests for initial \naccreditation and re-\naccreditation \n\nRequests \n\nCalibration of assessment \nteam leads \n\nWorkshops \n\nDOE calibration workshop \n\nWorkshops \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n14 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n3 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\n69 691 \n\n36 848 \n\nAssessments of \noperating entities \n\nWorkshops for \naccreditation \nexperts and \ndesignated \noperational entities \n(DOEs) \n\nStatus of outputs \n\nAt SB 011, a call for public input was requested for the draft “Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities” and the \ndraft tool “Article 6.4 sustainable development tool” (A6.4 SD Tool), specifically targeting CDM DOEs and validation and verification bodies from other market \nmechanisms. In the latter, an information note summarizing the comments was submitted for consideration at SBM 013. \n\nCurrently, 14 entities have applied for Article 6.4 accreditation at various stages of the process, including two initial accreditation on-site assessments in \nprogress and one initial accreditation on-site assessment completed. Regular surveillance will be conducted after the completion of the initial accreditation on-\nsite assessments.

The total rate of expenditure (56.6 per cent) is below the \nlinear rate of expenditure (100 percent) for the reporting period. \n\nStaff costs amount to 60.7 per cent of the 2024 budget for this object of expenditure which \nis significantly lower than the linear rate of 100 per cent. The lower rate is due to the timing \nbetween  the  selection  and  onboarding  of  recruited  staff  and  due  to  prudent  resource \nmanagement  including  capitalizing  on  the  synergies  with  human  resources  supporting \nother areas of work. \n\nConsultant costs amount to 140.0 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of \nexpenditure,  which  is  higher  than  the  projected  rate  of  expenditure  (100 per cent).  The \nhigher expenditure rate is due to obligations (48 per cent of the total consumed USD 733, \n812) for which the services are to be received in 2025. \n\nThe expert fees amount to 27.3 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of \nexpenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per \ncent). This reflects the fees for the two meetings of the AEP and three meetings of the \nMEP processed in the period. \n\n10. \n\nExpert  travel  amounts  to  58.3  per  cent  of  the  projected  2024  budget  for  this  object  of \nexpenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per \ncent). This represents travel costs of the in-person meetings of the panels and working \ngroups in 2024. \n\n11.  With  regard  to  travel  of  representatives,  there  were  no  meetings,  workshops  or  other \n\nevents during the reporting period. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\nTravel  of  Supervisory  Body  members  amounts  to  39.8  per  cent  of  the  projected  2024 \nbudget for this object of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of \nexpenditure  (100  per  cent).  This  represents  the  cost  of  the  in-person  meetings  of  the \nregulatory body. \n\nTravel of staff amounts to 36.4 per cent of the 2024 budget for this object of expenditure, \nwhich is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The lower \nexpenditure reflects reduced staff participation in events outside of Bonn, due to prudent \nresource management. \n\nTraining  costs  amount  to  19.2  per  cent  against  the  projected  2024  budget,  which  is \nsignificantly lower than the linearly projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The lower \nrate is due to prudent resource management. \n\n15.  Operating expenses amount to 30.7 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object \nof expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per \ncent). This is due to fewer meetings held throughout the year than anticipated. \n\n16. \n\nEngagement agreement costs, IT-related, costs amount to 52.1 of the 2024 budget for this \nobject of expenditure, which is lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). \n\n39 of 40 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-023 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation \n(1 January – 31 December 2024) \nVersion 01.0 \n\n- - - - - \n\nDocument information \n\nVersion \n\n01.0 \n\nDate \n\nDescription \n\n2 May 2025 \n\nInitial publication. \n\nDecision Class: Operational \nDocument Type: Information note \nBusiness Function: Governance  \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, budget, reporting procedures, resources management \n\n40 of 40 \n\n  \n \n \n\f"}, {"url": "https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-024.pdf", "title": "Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027", "text": "ARTICLE 6.4 MECHANISM \n\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \n\nInformation note \n\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business \nand resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \n\nVersion 01.0\n\n \n \n  \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \nVersion 01.0 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................  \n\nSTRATEGIC VISION AND OBJECTIVES .................................................................  \n\n2.1   Objective 1: Prompt operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism as \n\na global benchmark for high-integrity carbon credits .....................................  \n\n2.2 \n\nObjective 2: To support the effective utilization of the Article 6.4 \nmechanism by the full range of stakeholders ................................................  \n\nAPPENDIX. \n\nRESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN 2026–2027.......................................  \n\nPage \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n7 \n\n2 of 23 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \nVersion 01.0 \n\n1. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nIntroduction \n\nArticle 6  of  the  Paris  Agreement1  established  three  instruments  for  Parties  to  use  in \ntheir  nationally  determined \npursuing  voluntary  cooperation  when \ncontributions  (NDCs):  cooperative  approaches  involving  the  use  of  internationally \ntransferred mitigation outcomes (Article 6, paragraph 2); a mechanism to contribute to the \nmitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6, \nparagraph 4);  and  non-market  approaches  to  enable  cooperation  on  mitigation, \nadaptation, and the development of clean energy sources (Article 6, paragraph 8). \n\nimplementing \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA) adopted, at its third meeting, the “Rules, modalities and procedures for \nthe  mechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph 4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement”.2  This \n“rulebook”  delineates  principles,  key  requirements  and  processes  of  the  mechanism \nestablished  by  Article  6,  paragraph 4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (Article 6.4  mechanism), \nincluding the establishment of a Supervisory Body. The CMA requested the Supervisory \nBody  to  consider  and  further  develop  various  elements  in  the  rules,  modalities  and \nprocedures for its operationalization. \n\nAt  its  14th  meeting  in  Baku,  Azerbaijan,  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body  adopted  new \nstandards facilitating the creation, purchase, and sale of carbon credits. These standards \noutline  methodologies  for  crediting  emissions  reductions  or  removals  and  provide \nguidance for developing and accessing Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies, with these \nit ensures transparency, credibility, and the avoidance of leakage, as well as addressing \nrisks  in  emissions  projects.  The  CMA  took  note  of  these  developments,  marking  a \nsignificant  step  toward  operationalizing  a  global  carbon  market  under  the  Paris \nAgreement. \n\nThe Resource Allocation Plan 2026–2027 (RAP 2026–2027) presented in this document \nprovides an estimated budget for the Supervisory Body to carry out its work in 2026–2027 \nas specified in its workplan, as well as other activities deemed essential to operationalize \nthe  Article 6.4 mechanism.  The  RAP  2026-2027  takes  into  consideration  the  need  for \nflexibility in deploying resources and was prepared noting that the funding shortfall in 2025 \nhad required the implementation of contingency measures to limit expenditures to 72.8 % \nof the initial budget, and that the prudent management of resources will need to continue \nin the biennium 2026-2027. \n\n2.  Strategic vision and objectives \n\n5. \n\nThe  strategic  vision  of  the  Supervisory  Body  is  to  provide  a  mechanism  that  actively \ncontributes  to  the  global  mitigation  of  emissions  and  sustainable  development,  as \nmandated in Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement. It aims do this through a high-\nquality,  robust  and  inclusive  multilateral  crediting  mechanism  that  demonstrates  the \nhighest environmental integrity standards and by aiming to become a benchmark-setter. \n\n1  See document, The Paris Agreement available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-change-conference-november-\n2015/paris-agreement. \n\n2  See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 (decision 3/CMA.3) available at \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/documents/460950. \n\n3 of 23 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \nVersion 01.0 \n\n6. \n\nTo support the achievement of the RAP 2026–2027, the Supervisory Body will strive to \naccomplish the following objectives and related goals: \n\n2.1   Objective  1:  Prompt  operationalization  of  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  as  a \n\nglobal benchmark for high-integrity carbon credits \n\n7. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  intends  to  focus  its  primary  efforts  on  getting  the  Article 6.4 \nmechanism operational and “open-for-business” so that it can take its place as the only \nmultilaterally agreed and governed crediting mechanism that can be the global benchmark \nfor high integrity carbon credits. Once achieved, this objective will evolve into one focused \non  maintaining  the  operation  of  the  Article 6.4  mechanism  and  that  it  remains  ‘fit-for-\npurpose’. \n\n2.1.1  Goal  1:  Develop  and  adopt  efficient  and  effective  procedures,  processes,  and \n\ninfrastructure \n\n8. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nOperate  efficient  activity  assessment  processes  with  a  focus  on  meeting  all \ntimelines without compromising the quality of assessments; \n\nOperate  an  effective  accreditation  framework  through  the  development  of \naccreditation  standards  and  procedures  that  are  clear  and  easy  to  apply  while \nensuring  the  broadest  possible  regional  availability  of  designated  operational \nentities (DOEs); \n\nProvide effective and user-friendly infrastructure that facilitates the participation of \npublic  and  private  entities  in  the  mitigation  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by \nenabling access and ease of use; \n\nContinuously review and improve the procedures, processes and infrastructure for \nthe  Article 6.4  mechanism  in  a  nimble  manner  as  a  driver  of  innovation  and  by \nbeing responsive to innovation and best practices as they emerge in the carbon \ncredit markets; \n\nSupport  Parties  and  stakeholders  through  the  completion  of  the  transition  of \neligible  projects  and  certified  emissions  reductions  (CERs)  from  the  clean \ndevelopment mechanism to the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n2.1.2   Goal  2:  Set  the  global  benchmark  for  high  environmental  integrity  in  the \n\nquantification of mitigation outcomes from activities \n\n9. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nOperate an effective methodology development process that supports the needed \ntransformational  change,  and  facilitate  the  achievement  of  ambitious  emission \nreductions that are real, additional and verifiable as well as enhancements of long-\nterm removals; \n\nEngage  the  best  expert  knowledge  by  applying  a  science-  and  evidence-based \napproach; \n\nEnsure transparent and inclusive processes for the engagement of stakeholders \nand local communities; \n\n4 of 23 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(d) \n\nleading  role \n\nintegrity  and \nTake  a \nharmonization of standards for carbon crediting through outreach and engagement \nwith other crediting standards and initiatives. \n\nthe  discussions  on  environmental \n\nin \n\n2.2  Objective 2: To support the effective utilization of the Article 6.4 mechanism \n\nby the full range of stakeholders \n\n10.  Once  the  Article 6.4  mechanism  is  sufficiently  operational,  the  Supervisory  Body  will \nincrease  its  focus  on  enhancing  the  use  of  the  Article 6.4  mechanism  by  stakeholders, \nwhile noting that some activities will be undertaken to support this objective in parallel with \nthe objective above. \n\n2.2.1   Goal 3: Enable Party and non-Party stakeholders to understand and participate in \n\nthe Article 6.4 mechanism \n\n11. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nSupport  the  highest  quality  of  submissions  through  the  development  and \nstrengthening of the capacity and skills of designated national authorities, DOEs, \nactivity  participants  and  other  stakeholders’  regarding  the  requirements  of  the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism; \n\nPresent and protect a positive image of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing \nand proactively disseminating information and materials that promote awareness \nof the Article 6.4 mechanism and its benefits; \n\nEmpower host Parties to use the Article 6.4 mechanism as part of their national \napproaches  to  support  the  achievement  of  ambitious  NDCs  and  long-term  low-\nemission development strategies by promoting greater understanding of how the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism works in their interests. \n\n2.2.2   Goal  4:  Promote  that  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  achieves  an  equitable  regional \ndistribution of Article 6.4 activities and an equitable sharing in benefits from those \nactivities \n\n12. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nPromote the regional distribution of Article 6.4 activities and ensure that no Party \nis left behind by ensuring (i) the adaptability of the Article 6.4 mechanism to local \nconditions, (ii) its usability, and (iii) the minimization of its transaction cost and by \nactively engaging with potential host Parties through the provision of support by \nthe  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  Regional \nCollaboration Centres, including by the facilitation of market access; \n\nPromote the broadest possible participation and ensure that benefits are shared \nby  all,  taking  into  consideration  the  interests  of  host  Parties,  public  and  private \ninvestors,  and  the  users  of  the  Article 6,  paragraph 4,  mitigation  outcomes \n(A6.4ERs (either as MCUs3 or AERs4)). \n\n3  Article 6, paragraph 4, emissions reductions (mitigation contribution A6.4ERs), as per decision 6/CMA.4, \n\nannex, paragraph 29(b) \n\n4  Article  6,  paragraph  4,  emissions  reductions  (authorized  A6.4ERs),  as  per  decision  6/CMA.4,  annex, \n\nparagraph 29(a) \n\n5 of 23 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \nVersion 01.0 \n\n2.2.3  Goal  5:  Enable  demand  for  Article  6.4  mitigation  outcomes  from  the  Article  6.4 \n\nmechanism \n\n13. \n\nUnder this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nEngage with public and private stakeholders using MCUs for national policy and \nvoluntary  purposes  by  promoting  the  use  of  MCUs  for  reporting  on  the  climate \nimpact  of  activities  financed  through  the  purchase  and  voluntary  cancellation  of \nMCUs  as  results-based  finance;  and/or  engage  with  public  and  private  entities \ncontributing to the achievement of the host Party’s NDC. \n\nEngage with regulatory authorities and other entities on the use of AERs for NDC \nachievement by showcasing the potential of the Article 6.4 mechanism to supply \nthe highest-quality credits while ensuring that double-counting is avoided; \n\nTake  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure that  the  Article 6.4 mechanism  is  a leading \nsupplier of mitigation outcomes for use in other international mitigation purposes, \nspecifically through direct engagement with existing regulatory and national bodies \nand with any future market-based mechanism(s) that may be developed. \n\n6 of 23 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-024 \nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027 \nVersion 01.0 \n\nAppendix. \n\nResource Allocation Plan 2026–2027 \n\n1. \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThis  Resource  Allocation  Plan  2026–2027  (RAP 2026–2027)  outlines  the  activities  and \nresource requirements needed to support the Supervisory Body’s goals for 2026 and 2027 \nunder the Article 6.4 mechanism, noting that additional funding will be needed to cover the \nexpenditures for both years, considering the available resources and projected income. \n\n2.

Their \ncurrent status was updated on the Article 6.4 mechanism public website4 until 30 September 2025. \n\nIn addition, one  Article 6.4 DOE was accredited at SBM  015, and 16 applicant  entities  (AEs) have been undergoing  initial accreditation \nassessments in accordance with accreditation procedure of the Article 6.4 mechanism5 adopted at SB 008. \n\nA total of 22 entities were under administration, exceeding the estimated volume for the reporting period. However, only four assessments \nwere undertaken, which is below the estimated volume for the reporting period. This is due to the implementation of the above-mentioned \nSB 010 decision, which allows 28 CDM DOEs to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities under \nthe Article 6.4 mechanism without undergoing additional accreditation assessment. \n\nDuring the reporting period, there were no complaints or requests for review raised in accordance with the accreditation procedure of Article \n6.4 mechanism. \n\nThe DOE performance monitoring procedure considered at the second meeting of the Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP 002) and adopted \nat SBM 014 will be implemented once activity submissions requesting registration and issuance under Article 6.4 mechanism are received. \n\n3  Meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/SB010_report.pdf. \n\n4  https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/accreditation#CDM-DOEs-conducting-verification-of-requests-for-issuance-of-\n\ntransitioned-activities. \n\n5  Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation (A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001) available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf.  \n\n5 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-025 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) \nVersion 01.0 \n\n2.1.2.

The MEP 004 finalized the “Draft \nStandard:  Setting  the  baseline  in  mechanism  methodologies”  and  “Draft  Standard:  Demonstration  of  additionality  in  mechanism \nmethodologies” for submission to the Supervisory Body for its review and consideration for approval and/or further mandate to finalize the \nstandards. The MEP also finalized the “Draft Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies” and agreed to launch a call for \npublic inputs on this draft standard. Lastly, the MEP requested mandates from the Supervisory Body to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nInitiate work on a methodological tool for “Common practice analysis”; \n\nDevelop a concept note to analyse potential issues related to activities that are supported through a combination of public funding \nand carbon revenues; \n\n6  https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/methodologies#submissions. \n\n12 of 37 \n\n  \n \n \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-025 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) \nVersion 01.0 \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n(c) \n\nInitiate  work  to  amend  the  “Draft  Standard:  Demonstration  of  additionality  in  mechanism  methodologies”  to  include  methodology \nrequirements for PoAs; and renewal of the crediting period. \n\nAt MEP 005, the MEP considered 20 items and, based on guidance received at SBM 015, further revised and finalized the “Draft Standard: \nSetting  the  baseline  in  mechanism  methodologies”  and  the  “Draft  Standard:  Addressing  leakage  in  mechanism  methodologies”  for \nsubmission to the Supervisory Body. \n\nAt MEP 006, the MEP considered 14 items and finalized the draft “Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies” \nand the draft “Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa” and agreed to seek inputs \nfrom stakeholders on both documents. \n\nRegarding support for methodological work and other technical documents, non-staff costs included increased support from consultants to \ndraft Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies and revise CDM methodologies. \n\nRCCs provided on-site support to 23 project developers (three in Asia-Pacific, two in the Caribbean, five in East and Southern Africa, six in \nLatin America, and seven in Middle East and North Africa) regarding transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the role and responsibilities of \nArticle 6.4 mechanism DNAs, and approval and authorization matters relating to Article 6.4 mechanism activities. The number of on-site \nsupport instances was four times higher than anticipated, underscoring the continuation of an increased demand from stakeholders. \n\n24. \n\nRCC Caribbean was supporting the procedural and methodological clarification on update of electricity grid EF (ASB0015) for Dominican \nRepublic. \n\n13 of 37 \n\n  \n \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-025 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) \nVersion 01.0 \n\n2.1.6.

The Supervisory Body agreed to launch the interim mechanism \nregistry, enabling its immediate use to support activities under the Article 6.4 mechanism. To support users, the Supervisory Body requested \nthe secretariat to prepare and provide information and guidance to facilitate user interaction with the registry and its administrator. \n\nAt  the  same  meeting,  the  Supervisory  Body  adopted  the  “Procedure:  Article  6.4  mechanism  registry”.  This  procedure  formalizes  the \noperational processes of the mechanism registry, including account opening, transaction rules, and compliance with  the guidance of the \nConference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). \n\nThe Supervisory Body also took note of the development of the document “Important information about the mechanism registry for Parties”, \nwhich outlines critical considerations for Party account holders and supports understanding of their roles and responsibilities. \n\nAlso at its 15th meeting, the Supervisory Body took note of an information note on “Analysis of the pros and cons related to framing users’ \nrights with regard to control versus confirming ownership of account holdings” and agreed to proceed with the development of the mechanism \nregistry’s framing users’ rights with regard to control rather than seeking to confirm ownership of account holdings.

Therefore,  project  participants  of  CDM  activities  eligible  for  transition  to  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism should have begun to use the A6.4 SD tool starting from 09:00 CET of 11 February 2025. \n\nAt SBM 015, the Supervisory Body considered and adopted the revision to the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” and “Activity  cycle \nprocedure for programmes of activities”. The revisions provided procedural background for operationalization of the authorization process \nand exemption of Article 6.4 mechanism activities hosted in the Least Developing Countries (LDCs) and Small Islands Development States \n(SIDS) including an option for LDCs and SIDS not to apply this exemption, along with other changes. The Supervisory Body requested the \nsecretariat to elaborate an information note with options for a time limit from the date of issuance to when the host Party shall provide a \nstatement of authorization for post-issuance authorization of the A6.4ERs for consideration at a future meeting of the Supervisory Body \nbased on the experience gained from application of the exemption. \n\n16 of 37 \n\n  \n \n \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-025 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) \nVersion 01.0 \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nAt  SBM  015,  the  Supervisory  Body  considered  and  adopted  the  revision  to  “Standard:  Transition  of  CDM  activities  to  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism” and “Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” to provide the procedural basis for transition of CDM \nAfforestation/Reforestation  project  activities  and  PoAs.  At  SBM  016,  the  Supervisory  Body  further  revised  these  documents  to  include \nprovisions on avoidance of double issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities, and provisions which require the \nuse  of  re-evaluated  values  for  the  fraction  of  non-renewable  biomass  and  the  discount  factor  for  the  leakage  for  activities  using  CDM \nmethodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission reductions. \n\nAt SBM 016, the Supervisory Body considered and adopted the revisions to the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects”, the \n“Standard:  Article  6.4  activity  standard  for  programmes  of  activities”,  the  “Standard:  Article  6.4  validation  and  verification  standard  for \nprojects” and the “Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities”. The revisions incorporated relevant \nelements which must be followed by activity participants to develop and monitor Article 6.4 projects and PoAs, and by DOEs to validate and \nverify Article 6.4 projects and PoAs, contained in the “Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the \ndevelopment and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”, the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under \nthe Article 6.4 mechanism”, the “Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies” and the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable \ndevelopment  tool”.  The revisions  also  clarified  the  eligibility  date  for  the  start  date  of  Article  6.4  activities,  elaborated aspects  related  to \nalternative monitoring and deviation processes for activity participants in case of irremediable negative impacts detected, and reflected the \noutcomes of the structured editorial and legal review. \n\nThe secretariat conducted the initial structured legal and editorial review of the regulations and procedures approved by the Supervisory \nBody to ensure consistency among the regulations, including with regard to its Rules of Procedure, as mandated by the Supervisory Body \nat SB 010. The proposed changes in each document were submitted for consideration and approval by the Supervisory Body. In addition, \nat SBM 016, the Supervisory Body adopted the procedure \"Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory \nBody’s regulatory documents\". \n\nFor regulatory documents related to governance matters, at SBM 015, the Supervisory Body decided to revise the titles from the chair and \nvice-chair of the expert panels to co-chairs and adopted the revision of “Procedure: Terms of reference of the Article 6.4 mechanism expert \npanels” and “Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of the expert panels under the Supervisory Body”. Further, at \nSBM 016, the Supervisory Body adopted the revised “Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert \npanels”, “Terms of reference: Article 6.4 expert panels” and “Terms of Reference: Article 6.4 experts.” \n\n39. \n\nThe secretariat developed and published on the UNFCCC website a total of 42 forms related to: \n\n(a) \n\nGovernance: Appeal and Grievance forms operationalizing the appeals and grievance process as per the procedure “Appeal and \ngrievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”; approval, authorization and withdrawal forms associated with the host Party \n\n17 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-025 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nparticipation  requirements  for  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  as  envisaged  in  the  procedure  “Article  6.4  Activity  cycle  procedure  for \nprojects”; and the procedure “Article 6.4 procedure for programmes of activities;” \n\nActivity  cycle:  All  forms  required  for  Article  6.4  projects,  as  envisaged  in  the  procedure  “Article  6.4  activity  cycle  procedure  for \nprogrammes of activities;” \n\nCDM activity transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism: Revised approval form for CDM activity transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism; \naddendum to design document for CDM activity transition request; and declaration on avoidance of double issuance for provisional \nrequests for issuance for Article 6.4 transition projects and PoAs, as envisaged in the procedure “Transition of CDM activities to the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism;” \n\nMethodologies  and  methodological  tools:  “Global  stakeholder  consultation  form  for  proposed  new  baseline  and  monitoring \nmethodology or methodological tool,” as envisaged in the procedure “Development, revision, and clarification of methodologies and \nmethodological tools.” \n\n2.1.8.

Article  6.4  training  products  that  cater  to  specialized  and  broader  audiences  were  under \ndevelopment, with their launch expected in December 2025. \n\n51. \n\n52. \n\nIn the reporting period, three subregional workshops on Article 6 and Carbon Pricing were delivered in South Asia, Middle East and North \nAfrica, and Western and South Africa. An Article 6 implementation laboratory was conducted as part of the implementation forum during the \nfirst Climate Week in Panama. During sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 62), an Article 6 side event and Article 6 capacity-building \nsession  were  organized  for  Parties  and  diverse  stakeholders.  Other  capacity-building  activities,7  including  webinars,  country  support, \nworkshops and training sessions, were organized across different regions. \n\nTargeted  capacity-building  support,  including  through  RCCs,  in  the  form  of  webinars,  in-country  support,  and  event  presentations,  was \nfocused on various aspects of Article 6.4 operationalization and engagement, roles and responsibilities of host Parties and DNAs, framework \nand strategy development, and project/programme development under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Article 6 Capacity Building Team, \ntogether with the other substantive teams, developed a user-friendly manual8 for host Parties’ participation in the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n7  For details of activities, see information note available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2024_inf01.pdf. \n\n8  For more information, see document A6.4-SBM015-AA-A04 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A64-SBM015-AA-A04.pdf. \n\n23 of 37 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fA6.4-INFO-GOV-025 \nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025) \nVersion 01.0 \n\nThe manual was launched in early 2025.

The total rate of expenditure (43.8 per cent) is below the \nlinear rate of expenditure (50 percent) for the reporting period. \n\nStaff costs amount to 31.1 per cent of the 2025 budget for this object of expenditure, which \nis significantly lower than the linear rate of 50 per cent. The lower rate is due to prudent \nresource  management,  including  capitalizing  on  the  synergies  with  human  resources \nsupporting other areas of work. \n\nConsultant costs amount to 68.3 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of \nexpenditure,  which  is  higher  than  the  projected  rate  of  expenditure  (50 per cent).  The \nhigher expenditure rate is due to obligations for which the services are yet to be received. \n\nThe expert fees amount to 17.3 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of \nexpenditure,  which  is  significantly  lower  than  the  projected  rate  of  expenditure  (50  per \ncent).

With regard to travel of representatives, there were no charges during the reporting period. \n\n89. \n\n90. \n\n91. \n\n92. \n\n93. \n\nTravel  of  Supervisory  Body  members  amounts  to  35.1  per  cent  of  the  projected  2025 \nbudget for this object of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of \nexpenditure  (50  per  cent).  This  represents  the  cost  of  the  in-person  meetings  of  the \nregulatory body. \n\nTravel of staff amounts to 38.4 per cent of the 2025 budget for this object of expenditure, \nwhich is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The lower \nexpenditure reflects reduced staff participation in events outside of Bonn, due to prudent \nresource management. \n\nTraining  costs  amount  to  10.9  per  cent  against  the  projected  2025  budget,  which  is \nsignificantly lower than the linearly projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The lower \nrate is due to prudent resource management. \n\nOperating expenses amount to 31.2 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object \nof expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per \ncent). The lower rate is due to prudent resource management. \n\nEngagement agreement  (IT)  costs  amount to  76.6 per cent  of the 2025 budget for  this \nobject of expenditure, which is significantly higher than the projected rate of expenditure \n(50 per cent).

You agree that any disputes, claims, or other issues that may arise between you and \nother  account  holders  or  third  parties  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  any  issues  or \ndisputes  relating  to  the  validity  of  project  information,  transactions  in  the  Registry, \nownership  of,  security  over,  or  proprietary  interests  in  Article  6.4  Emissions \nReductions  held  in  the  Registry)  will  be  addressed  and  resolved  between  you  and \nsuch  account  holders  or  you  and  third  parties,  and  without  our  involvement,  or the \ninvolvement  of  the  United  Nations  or  its  subsidiary  bodies,  except  as  may  be \notherwise provided for in these Terms and conditions. \n\n7.7.  You  will  use  your  best  efforts  to  amicably  settle  any  dispute,  claim  or  other  issue \narising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  your  use  of  the  Registry,  or  these  Terms  and \nconditions, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof. \n\n7.8. \n\n7.9. \n\nIf  you  are  unable to resolve  any  dispute  arising in relation to the  Registry  or  these \nTerms and conditions amicably, then you must seek an amicable settlement through \nconciliation in accordance with the Conciliation Rules then prevailing of UNCITRAL. \n\nIf  a  dispute  remains  unresolved  sixty  (60)  days  after  one  party  receives  a  written \nrequest from the other party for such amicable settlement, either party may refer the \ndispute  to  an  arbitral  tribunal  composed  of  three  members  in  accordance  with  the \nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then prevailing. The place of arbitration shall be Geneva, \nSwitzerland. \n\n7.10.  Each  party  to  the  dispute  shall  appoint  one  arbitrator,  and  the  two  arbitrators  thus \nappointed shall together appoint a third arbitrator as their Chairperson. If one of the \nparties  fails  to  appoint  its  arbitrator  and  has  not  proceeded  to  do  so  within  two  (2) \nmonths after an invitation from the other party to make such an appointment, the other \nParty may request the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The \nHague to make the necessary appointment. If the two arbitrators are unable to reach \nagreement, in the two months following their appointment, on the choice of the third \narbitrator,  either  party may invite  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Permanent  Court  of \nArbitration at The Hague to make the necessary appointment. \n\n7.11.  The arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages. In addition, \nthe arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award interest in excess of the London \nInter-Bank Offered Rate then prevailing, and any interest shall be simple interest only. \nThe  parties  shall  be  bound  by  any  arbitration  award  rendered  as  a  result  of  such \narbitration as the final adjudication of any such dispute, controversy, or claim. We may \naccept instructions for actions in the Registry from an account holder pursuant to the \noutcome of the arbitration, with valid and verified evidence of the arbitration outcome. \n\n7.12.  Notwithstanding items 7.7 through 7.11 herein, if a valid and enforceable agreement \nexists  between  the  disputing  parties  that contains  a  dispute  resolution mechanism, \nsuch  mechanism  shall  take  precedence  and  shall  be  the  exclusive  means  for \nresolving disputes between those parties, in lieu of the dispute resolution procedure \nset  forth  in  these  Terms  and  conditions;  provided,  however,  that  such  mechanism \nshall not conflict with, override, or purport to waive any of the provisions contained in \nitems 7.1 through 7.5 and 7.12 of these Terms and conditions. \n\n9 of 11 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-INFO-REGS-001 \nInformation note: Terms and conditions for entity account holders \nVersion 01.0 \n\n7.13.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) \nfor  the  mechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (the \nArticle  6.4  mechanism). 1  Chapter  XI.A  of  the  RMPs  contains  provisions  that  allow \ntransition  of  project  activities  and  programmes of  activities (PoAs)  registered  under the \nclean development mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol or listed as \nprovisional as per the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Board of the CDM2 \n(hereinafter referred to as provisional requests) to the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  fourth  session,  elaborated  key  conditions  and  processes  for  such \ntransition. 3  At  the  same  session,  the  CMA  also  requested 4  the  Supervisory  Body  to \nfacilitate the tasks related to the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nby: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDeveloping  and  operationalizing  a  procedure  for  requesting  transition,  which \nincludes relevant forms, by no later than June 2023; \n\nDeveloping and operationalizing the transition process and reporting back to the \nCMA at its fifth session. \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  sixth  session 5 ,  decided  that  afforestation  and  reforestation  project \nactivities and PoAs registered under the CDM may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism, \nand  be  registered  as  Article  6.4  activities.  The  CMA  also  elaborated  key  conditions  for \nsuch a transition. \n\nPursuant  to  its  mandate  from  the  CMA  to  operationalize  the  transition  process,  the \nSupervisory Body has adopted the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article \n6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the transition standard) and the “Procedure: \nTransition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as this \nprocedure) and relevant forms as contained in this document. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  at  its  16th  meeting  agreed  to  provisions  on  avoidance  of  double \nissuance  for  provisional  requests  for  issuance  for  transition  activities.  The  Supervisory \nBody  further  decided  to  require  the  use  of  re-evaluated  values  for  the  fraction  of  non-\nrenewable biomass (fNRB) and the discount factor for the leakage for activities using CDM \nmethodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission reductions. \n\n1  Decision  3/CMA.3,  annex,  as  contained  in  document  FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

The \nproject participant shall provide the information in the form contained in Appendix 1 by 31 \nDecember 2025, at 24:00 hours (Central European Time). \n\nIn requesting the transition of a CDM PoA that had included CPAs under the CDM, the \nproject participant shall specify which of the included CPAs that are eligible for transition \nto the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition \nstandard  it  wishes  to  transition  to  the  Article  6.4  mechanism.  CPAs  included  in  a  PoA \nunder  the  CDM  may  transition  to  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  in  conjunction  with,  or \nsubsequent to, the transition of the PoA to the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\nThe secretariat shall check the completeness of the information provided in the submitted \nrequest for transition and, if found complete, publish the request on the UNFCCC website \nproviding the web link to the project information page of the CDM project activity or CDM \nPoA  on  the  UNFCCC  CDM  website,  and  assigning  a  unique  reference  number(s)  that \nenable(s)  the  identification  of  the  CDM  project  activity,  or  PoA  and  CPAs  therein, \ntransitioned  to  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  distinguishing  them  from  new  activities \nregistered  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism.  If  found  incomplete,  the  secretariat  shall \npromptly notify the reason for the incompleteness to the project participant. The project \nparticipant shall submit a corrected request for transition within 14 days of the notification; \notherwise the secretariat shall reject the request. \n\nAfter publishing the request for transition on the UNFCCC website, the secretariat shall \npromptly inform the DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism and the DNA for the CDM of the \nhost Party of the CDM project activity or PoA of the receipt of the request. If the host Party \nhas not yet established the DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism, the secretariat shall inform \nits national focal point to the UNFCCC (hereinafter collectively referred to as the DNA for \nthe  Article 6.4 mechanism)  of  the request.8 With  this, the request for  transition  shall  be \ndeemed as having been submitted by the project participants to both the secretariat and \nthe host Party in accordance with paragraph 73(a) of the RMPs. \n\n5.2.  Global stakeholder consultation \n\n14. \n\nParties,  stakeholders  and  UNFCCC  admitted  observer  organizations  may  submit \ncomments,  in  English,  on  the  transition  of  the  CDM  project  activity,  or  PoA  and  CPAs \ntherein, to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website within 28 \ndays  of  the  publication  of  the  request  for  transition  on  the  UNFCCC  website.

Comments  from \nstakeholders shall: \n\n(a) \n\nBe specific to the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, being requested \nfor transition; \n\n(b) \n\nBe related to the compliance with applicable rules and regulations for transition. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  make  the  comments  that  meet  the  requirements  in  paragraph  14 \nabove publicly available on the UNFCCC website where the transition request is displayed \nand  inform  the  Supervisory  Body  and  the  DNAs  of  the  host  Party  and  other  Parties \ninvolved that the comments have been made public. \n\nFor a CDM PoA being requested for transition, after the global stakeholder consultation \nbut before the approval by the host Party of the transition in accordance with section 5.3 \nbelow, the project participants may: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAdd  eligible  CPAs  not  specified  in  the  initial  transition  request  referred  to  in \nparagraph 11 above; and/or \n\nRemove  from  the  transition  request  any  CPAs  specified  in  the  initial  transition \nrequest. \n\nFor the cases referred to in paragraph 16 above, the project participants shall submit a \nrevised  transition  request  to  the  secretariat  through  the  dedicated  interface  on  the \nUNFCCC website referred to in paragraphs 9 above or 10 above, reflecting the addition \nand/or  removal  of  CPAs  that  they  wish  to  transition  to  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  in \nconjunction with, or subsequent to, the transition of the PoA. The secretariat shall check \nthe completeness of the revised transition request and, if it is found to be complete, shall \npublish it on the UNFCCC website, replacing the initial transition request, and promptly \ninform  the  DNAs for  the  Article  6.4  mechanism and  the  DNAs for the  CDM  of the  host \nParties of the receipt of the revised transition request. The revised transition request is not \nrequired to undergo a new global stakeholder consultation. \n\n5.3.  Submission of host Party approval \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\nThe host Party of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, regarding which a \nrequest  for  transition  has  been  published  on  the  UNFCCC  website  shall,  if  it  approves \nsuch transition, submit an approval of transition from its DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism \nto the Supervisory Body through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing \nthe information in the form contained in appendix 2,9 by 31 December 2025, 24:00 (Central \nEuropean Time). \n\nThe  least  developed  countries  (LDCs)  and  small  island  developing  States  (SIDS)  may \ninclude information, either when submitting their participation requirements to the Article \n6.4  mechanism  or  at  the  approval  stage  of  an  activity,  on  whether  they  choose  not  to \nexempt the CDM project activity or PoA and CPAs therein, hosted in their territories and \nrequesting transition, from the share of proceeds for adaptation. \n\n20. \n\nNotwithstanding paragraph 19 above, if an LDC or SIDS host Party has already submitted \nits participation requirements or provided approval for a CDM project activity or PoA and \n\n9  The secretariat may convert the form into an electronic interface. \n\n6 of 24 \n\n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-001 \nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 05.1 \n\nCPAs therein hosted in their territories and requesting transition, by the time of entry of \nforce  of  version  4  of  this  procedure,  the  LDCs  and  SIDS,  may  provide  information  on \nwhether  they  choose  not  to  exempt  the  CDM  project  activity  or  PoA  and  CPAs  therein \nfrom the share of proceeds for adaptation by resubmitting the participation requirements \nand/or the approval form at the latest by 31 December 2025 or at first issuance, whichever \nis earlier. If no such information is received by the deadline, the exemption from the share \nof proceeds for adaptation shall be effected. \n\nA multi-country PoA may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism provided that at least one \nhost Party has provided approval within the deadline referred to in paragraph 18 above. If \nthere is more than one host Party for a CDM PoA10 being requested for transition, only the \nCPAs in the host Parties that have submitted an approval of transition by the deadline may \ntransition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the transition \nof the PoA. \n\nThe project participant or DOE (hereinafter collectively referred to as the proponent) may \nproceed  with  the  submission  of  the  additional  documentation  referred  to  in  section  5.4 \nbelow after at least one host Party has submitted an approval of transition. If the proponent \nwishes to transition any of the CPAs specified in the transition request subsequent to the \ntransition  of  the  CDM  PoA,  the  proponent  shall  prepare  the  additional  documentation \nreferred to in section 5.4 below for each such transition request of CPAs. \n\nThe  host  Party  may  submit  an  approval  of  transition  only  after  it  has  fulfilled  the \nrequirements for participating in the Article 6.4 mechanism referred to in paragraph 26 of \nthe RMPs by demonstrating the fulfilment in accordance with the relevant provisions in the \n“Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” or the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure \nfor programmes of activities”, as applicable. \n\nIf the host Party approves the transition, it shall provide a statement of authorization on \nthe  use  of  A6.4ERs  to  be  issued  for  the  project  or  PoA  and  CPAs  therein  as  early  as \npossible but prior to the first issuance of A6.4ERs for the project, PoA and CPAs therein.11 \nThe host Party shall provide such a statement by completing a form, through a dedicated \ninterface on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf the host Party has indicated that it allows mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be issued \nfor the project or PoA and CPAs therein, while noting that it may authorize the A6.4ERs \nat  a  later  stage,  the  respective  rules  and  requirements  shall  be  applied  as  per  the \nrespective provisions of the procedures “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedures \nfor  projects”  and  “Procedure:  Article  6.4  activity  cycle  procedure  for  programmes  of \nactivities”. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\nThe secretariat shall publish the host Party approval of transition on the UNFCCC website \nand promptly inform the project participant of the receipt of such approval. \n\n10  Under the CDM, a PoA may be designed beyond the border of a country and thus could have more than \none  host  Party,  while  a  project  activity  shall  be  designed  within  the  border  of  a  country  and  thus  will \nalways have only one host Party. \n\n11  As per decision -/CMA.6 (Advance unedited version).

Submission of additional documentation \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nIf the project participant continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology to the \ntransitioning  CDM  project  activity,  or  PoA  and  CPAs  therein,  in  accordance  with  the \nrelevant  provisions  in  the  transition  standard,  it  shall,  within  180  days  for  emission \nreduction projects and PoAs of the publication of the host Party approval of transition in \naccordance with paragraph 26 above and before 31 December 2025 for CDM A/R projects \nand  PoAs,  submit  to  the  secretariat,  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite, an addendum to the respective project design document (PDD), or PoA design \ndocument (PoA-DD) and CPA design documents (CPA-DDs), using the form contained in \nappendix 312 to attest that the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, have been \nimplemented in accordance with the registered PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, as well \nas to demonstrate the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the \nArticle  6.4  mechanism  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  in  the  transition \nstandard. With the attestation in the addendum, the relevant PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-\nDDs, shall be deemed submitted by the project participant. \n\nNotwithstanding paragraph 27 above, for CDM A/R project activities or CDM A/R PoAs \nand the CPAs therein that have successfully transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the \nPPs shall request a designated operational entity (DOE) accredited in the relevant sectoral \nscope under the Article 6.4 mechanism to validate and assess compliance of the additional \ndocumentation  with  the  respective  applicable  requirements  for  activities  involving \nremovals  under  the  mechanism  contained  in  the  standard  “Requirements  for  activities \ninvolving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applicable methodological \nregulatory  document  approved  by  the  Supervisory  Body.  This  validation  shall  occur  in \nconjunction with verification for first issuance. \n\nIf  the  project  participant  voluntarily  replaces,  or  is  required  to  replace,  the  CDM \nmethodology currently applied to the transitioning CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs \ntherein, with an Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter referred to as mechanism \nmethodology) in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard, it shall \nrevise the PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, accordingly, using the corresponding forms \ndeveloped for Article 6.4 mechanism activities, and request a designated operational entity \n(DOE)  accredited  in  the  relevant  sectoral  scope  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  to \nvalidate them to demonstrate appropriate application of the mechanism methodology and \nthe  compliance  with  additional  requirements  for  registration  under  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  in  the  transition  standard.  If  the \nvalidation outcome is positive (i.e. the mechanism methodology is appropriately applied \nand  the  compliance  with  additional  requirements  for  registration  under  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism is demonstrated), the DOE shall, within one year of the publication of the host \nParty  approval  of  transition  in  accordance  with  paragraph  26  above  or  within  one  year \nafter  the  applicable  mechanism  methodology  becomes  available,  whichever  is  later, \nsubmit  to  the  secretariat,  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC  website,  the \nrevised PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, as well as the validation report. \n\n5.5.  Processing of transition request \n\n30. \n\nThe secretariat shall, upon receipt of the additional documentation referred to in paragraph \n27  or  29  above,  issue  a  statement  of  the  transition  fee  due,  determined  based  on  the \nfollowing principles, and shall communicate it to the project participant or the DOE who \n\n12  The secretariat may convert this form into an electronic interface for the submission of the addendum. \n\n8 of 24 \n\n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-001 \nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 05.1 \n\nsubmitted  the  additional  documentation  (hereinafter  collectively  referred  to  as  the \nproponent): \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nRequests for transition of CDM project activities, PoAs and CPAs are subject to \nthe share of proceeds applicable to requests for registration of projects and PoAs \nand  inclusion  of  component  projects  (CPs),  respectively,  under  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism;13 \n\nAll  fees  for  requests  for  registration,  issuance,  renewal  and  post-registration \nchanges to project activities and PoAs as well as inclusion of CPs under the Article \n6.4  mechanism  are  waived  for  activities  in  least  developed  countries  and  small \nisland developing States.14 \n\nThe  project  participant shall  pay  the  transition fee  by  bank transfer,  quoting  the  unique \nreference  number(s)  referred  to  in  paragraph  12  above.  The  project  participant  shall \nsubmit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated interface on the \nUNFCCC website. \n\nThe paid transition fee may be reimbursed in full or partially if the request for transition is \nwithdrawn  by  the  proponent  in  accordance  with  section  7  below  or  rejected  by  the \nSupervisory Body in line with the corresponding provisions on the reimbursement of the \nregistration fee as contained in the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” or the \n“Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. \n\nThe secretariat shall, upon receipt of the proof of payment of the transition fee if it is due, \nor upon receipt of the additional documentation if the transition fee is not due, commence \nthe completeness check of the additional documentation for transition requests for CDM \nproject activity, or PoA and CPAs for which the host Party(ies) provided approval as per \nsection 5.3 above. To commence the completeness check, the secretariat shall prioritize \nrequests for transition for small-scale CDM project activities and CDM PoAs. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  conclude  the  completeness  check  within  seven  days  of  its \ncommencement. If, during the completeness check, the secretariat identifies issues of an \neditorial nature or of consistency in the documentation, it shall request the proponent to \nsubmit revised documents to correct them. In this case, the proponent shall submit the \nrequested documents within two days of receipt of the request. Upon receipt of the revised \ndocuments, the secretariat shall resume15 the completeness check. If the proponent does \nnot submit the requested documents by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that \nthe  request  submission  is  incomplete  and  inform  the  proponent  that  the  request  for \ntransition  cannot  be  processed  any  further.  The  proponent  may  restart  the  process  by \nsubmitting the additional documentation again with the revised documents in accordance \nwith section 5.4 above, which is subject to a new transition fee. \n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\nUpon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall commence the \nsubstantive check of the additional documentation to determine whether the transitioning \nCDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, complies with the relevant requirements \nfor  transition  contained  in  the  transition  standard  within  21  days  of  its  commencement. \n\n13  In accordance with decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, paragraph 14(a). \n\n14  In accordance with decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, paragraph 58. \n\n15  The same deadlines apply to the resumed completeness check as applicable to the initial completeness \n\ncheck. \n\n9 of 24 \n\n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-001 \nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 05.1 \n\nUpon  conclusion  of  the  substantive  check,  the  secretariat  shall  publish  the  additional \ndocumentation  and  indicate  the  completion  of  the  substantive  check  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite  and  notify  the  host  Party  and  the  Supervisory  Body  of  the  completion  of  the \nsubstantive check to initiate the review process in accordance with section 5.6 below. If, \nduring  the  substantive  check,  the  secretariat  identifies  substantive  issues  that  may  be \nresolved by revising the additional documentation, it shall request the proponent to submit \nrevised documents to resolve them. In this case, the proponent shall submit the requested \ndocuments  within  seven  days  of  receipt  of  the  request.  Upon  receipt  of  the  revised \ndocuments,  the  secretariat  shall resume16 the  substantive  check. If the proponent  does \nnot submit the requested documents by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that \nthe request submission is incomplete. \n\n36. \n\nThe secretariat shall prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the \ntransition request, summarizing its findings in respect of the compliance with the relevant \nrequirements  for  transition  contained  in  the  transition  standard  and  including  its \nrecommendation whether to approve the requested transition within 14 days of the date \nof publication of the additional documentation. \n\n5.6.  Requesting review of transition request \n\n37. \n\nThe host Party of the transitioning CDM project activity or PoA, or any member or alternate \nmember of the Supervisory Body, may request a review of the request for transition within \n28  days  of  receipt  of  the  notification  of  the  completion  of  the  substantive  check  in \naccordance  with  paragraph  35  above,  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite, providing reasons for requesting a review. \n\n38. \n\nIf a review of the request for transition is requested by the host Party or any member or \nalternate member of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nNotify the proponent that the request is under review; \n\nIndicate such status on the UNFCCC website, and request the project participant \nand/or the DOE to:  \n\n(i) \n\nProvide responses to the issues identified in the request for review no later \nthan  seven  days  from  the  date  of  notification  that  the  request  has  been \nplaced under review; \n\n(ii)  For  each  issue  (or  sub-issue)  raised  in  the  request  for  review,  the  project \n\nparticipant and/or the DOE (if applicable) shall either: \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nRespond by making any revisions that they deem necessary to the \nrelevant  documentation,  submitting  revised  documents  in  track \nchanges and final versions; or \n\nRespond in writing, explaining why no revisions to the documentation \nare necessary. \n\n16  The same deadlines apply to the resumed completeness check as applicable to the initial completeness \n\ncheck. \n\n10 of 24 \n\n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-001 \nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 05.1 \n\n39. \n\n40. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  present  the  case  to  the  Supervisory  Body  at  its  next  meeting  or \nelectronically. \n\nFor cases applying a new Article 6.4 methodology, as set out in paragraph 29 above, the \nreview  process  shall  follow  the  procedures  specified  in  the  “Article  6.4  activity  cycle \nprocedure  for  projects”  and  the  “Article  6.4  activity  cycle  procedure  for  PoAs”,  as \napplicable. \n\n5.7.  Finalizing transition request \n\n41. \n\n42. \n\nIf  no  review  of  the  request  for  transition  is  requested  by  the  deadline  referred  to  in \nparagraph  37  above,  the  request  for  transition  shall  be  deemed  approved  by  the \nSupervisory Body. \n\nStakeholders, project participants, the host Party or other participating Parties (hereinafter \nreferred to as “eligible individuals, communities and organizations that have standing for \nfilling an appeal”) may, in accordance with the appeal and grievance procedure,17 file an \nappeal to the Supervisory Body’s decision to approve the transition18 within 28 days of the \nrequest  for  transition  being  deemed  approved.  If  no  appeal  is  filed  by  an  eligible \nstakeholder,  project  participant  or  Party  within  this  time  frame,  the  transition  shall  be \ndeemed final. If an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project participant or Party \nwithin this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed. \n\n43. \n\nIf a review of the request for transition is requested, the Supervisory Body shall review the \nrequest and take one of the following decisions, taking into account the presentation on \nthe case by the secretariat: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApprove the request; \n\nConditionally approve the request, provided that the project participants agree to \nthe  modifications  to  the  additional  documentation  proposed  by  the  Supervisory \nBody; \n\n(c) \n\nReject the request. \n\n44. \n\n45. \n\n46. \n\nFor the case referred to in paragraph 43(b) above, if the proponent does not agree with \nthe modification within seven days of the decision, the request shall be deemed rejected \nby the Supervisory Body. \n\nThe secretariat shall notify the decision of the Supervisory Body to the proponent, the host \nParty and the DOE (if applicable), and indicate it on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf the decision of the Supervisory Body is to reject the request for transition, the proponent \nmay not resubmit a request for transition of the same CDM project activity, or PoA and \nCPAs therein. \n\n47. \n\nIf  the  decision  of  the  Supervisory  Body  is  to  approve  the  transition  of  the  CDM  project \nactivity, or PoA and CPAs therein, the secretariat shall inform the Executive Board of the \n\n17   “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism” (A6.4-PROC-GOV-006). \n\nSee https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-006.pdf. \n\n18  For decision on finalization of the provisional request for issuance the deadline for appeal is 14 days as \n\nper the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. \n\n11 of 24 \n\n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-001 \nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 05.1 \n\nCDM  of  the  decision.  The  secretariat  shall  register  the  activity  under  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism, to be effective on the day it is deregistered from the CDM. \n\n48. \n\nEligible stakeholders, project participants and Parties may, in accordance with the appeal \nand  grievance  procedure,  file  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Supervisory  Body \nwithin  28  days  of  the  decision19.  If  no  appeal  is filed  by an  eligible stakeholder,  project \nparticipant or Party within this time frame, the decision of the Supervisory Body shall be \ndeemed final. If an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project participant or Party \nwithin this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed. \n\n49. \n\nIrrespective of the effective date of transition, the crediting period of the transitioned project \nactivity and CPAs as well as the PoA period of the transitioned PoA under the Article 6.4 \nmechanism shall start from 1 January 2021. \n\n50.  Once registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the transitioned project activities, PoAs \nand CPAs for which the host Party(ies) provided approval as per section 5.3 above shall \nbe subject to all relevant requirements under the Article 6.4 mechanism at all subsequent \nsteps in the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism, taking into account the relevant \nprovisions in the transition standard. \n\n51. \n\nFor a multi-country PoA that has transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, if the transition \nis processed without having an approval of transition by all host Parties: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAny remaining host Parties may be added to the PoA and the CPAs hosted in those \ncountries may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism after the transition of the PoA \nin accordance with paragraph 21 above; \n\nIf  any  remaining  host  Parties  miss  the  deadline  for  providing  an  approval  of \ntransition referred to in paragraph 18 above, addition of these host Parties to the \nPoA is still possible by undergoing the post-registration change process under the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism, but the CPAs hosted by these countries and included in the \ntransition request may no longer transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism; \n\n(c) \n\nA new host Party may be added to the transitioned PoA in accordance with the \nrelevant provisions under the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n6.  Process for finalizing provisional requests \n\n52. \n\nProcess  for  finalization  of  provisional  requests  shall  follow  the  provisions  in  section  5 \nabove, mutatis mutandis, with the following modifications: \n\n(a) \n\nThe project participant may submit a request for finalization of a provisional request \nfor issuance under the transition procedure if the underlying CDM project activity \nor  PoA  continues  to apply  the  currently  applied  CDM  methodology  at  transition, \nand only after the Supervisory Body has approved the transition of the underlying \nCDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, to the Article 6.4 mechanism. In \nthis  case,  the  deadline  for  submission  for  the  transition  request  referred  to  in \nparagraph 9 above is not applicable and additional documentation to be submitted \nin accordance with paragraph 27 above shall be: \n\n19  See footnote 18. \n\n12 of 24 \n\n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-001 \nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 05.1 \n\n(i) \n\nA revised monitoring report instead of an addendum to the PDD, or PoA-DD \nand CPA-DDs, recalculating the emission reductions by applying: \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nThe global warming potentials for the period from 1 January 2021 as \nspecified in the transition standard; and  \n\nThe  updated  fraction  of  non-renewable  biomass  (fNRB)  value  and \nthe  discount  factor  for  addressing  leakage  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  of  transition  standard  for  activities  using  CDM \nmethodologies  that  have  a  risk  of  non-permanence  of  emission \nreductions.  \n\n(ii)  A declaration on avoidance of double issuance including, when the activity \nhas been registered or is registered under another scheme, a confirmation \nfrom the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals being requested for issuance as A6.4ERs have not been \ncredited and have not been requested for crediting under the other crediting \nscheme using a form published on the UNFCCC website20. \n\nProvisional  inclusion  of  CPAs  may  be  finalized  if  the  underlying  CDM  PoA \ncontinues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition, and only \nin conjunction, or subsequent to, with the transition of the CDM PoA to the Article \n6.4 mechanism.

Submission of withdrawal notification \n\n263.  The host Party of a proposed or registered A6.4 project may, through its DNA, submit a \nnotification to the secretariat to withdraw the approval of the project or the authorization of \nany of the activity participants made in accordance with paragraphs 23‒24 above any time \nthrough  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC  website,  providing  the  following \ninformation: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe project title and its unique UNFCCC reference number; \n\nThe type of withdrawal (either withdrawal of approval of project or withdrawal of \nauthorization of activity participants); \n\nThe names of activity participants to whom the withdrawal of authorization applies \n(if the withdrawal only relates to the authorization of activity participants); \n\nThe effective date of the withdrawal, which shall be at least 60 days after the date \nof the notification of the withdrawal unless the host Party specifies an earlier date \nwith justification; \n\n(e) \n\nThe reason(s) for the withdrawal. \n\n264.  Other participating Parties may withdraw the authorization of activity participants made in \naccordance with paragraph 26 above, through their DNAs, any time through the dedicated \ninterface on the UNFCCC website, providing the information listed in paragraph 263(a)−(e) \nabove. \n\n48 of 54 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-002 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects \nVersion 03.0 \n\n265.  Upon  receipt  of  the  withdrawal  notification,  the  secretariat  shall  promptly  inform  the \naffected activity participants of the notification and check whether the information provided \nis  complete.  If  found  incomplete,  the  secretariat  shall  request  the  DNAs  of  the  Parties \nsubmitting the withdrawal to provide the missing information. \n\n266.  The  secretariat  shall  publish  the  withdrawal  of  the  approval  of  the  project  and/or  the \nauthorization of activity participants on the UNFCCC website on the effective date of the \nwithdrawal. \n\n267. \n\nIf the host Party withdraws the approval of the project: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nIf  the  effective  date  of  the  withdrawal  is  before  the  DOE  submits  a  request  for \nregistration  of  the  project  in  accordance  with  paragraph 67  above,  such request \nmay not be submitted; \n\nIf the effective date of the withdrawal is after the DOE has submitted of a request \nfor registration but before the final decision of the Supervisory Body on the request, \nthe request shall not be processed; \n\nIf the effective date of the withdrawal is after the final decision of the Supervisory \nBody to register the project, the provisions outlined in paragraph 268 below shall \napply. \n\n12.1.2. Impact of withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant \n\n268.  For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party withdrew its approval, requests for \nissuance of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project before \nto the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline specified in \nparagraph 177  above.  Consequently,  the  A6.4ERs  may  be  issued  in  accordance  with \nsections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover a monitoring \nperiod from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the project. \n\n269.  For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party or other participating Parties only \nwithdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for \nGHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  achieved  by  the  project  may  still  be \nsubmitted  until  the  deadline  specified  in  paragraph 177  above.  Consequently,  the \nA6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity \nparticipant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance \nand distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn \nshall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the project  for the monitoring \nperiod prior to the date of the withdrawal of the authorization. \n\n13.  Appeals and grievances \n\n270.  Stakeholders,  the  activity  participants,  the  host  Party  and  other  participating  Parties, \nthrough  their  DNAs,  may  appeal  decisions  of  the  Supervisory  Body  or  request  that  a \ngrievance be addressed in accordance with paragraphs 89, 103, 198 and 214 above and \nthe “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. \n\n49 of 54 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-002 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects \nVersion 03.0 \n\nAppendix 1.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) \nfor  the  mechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph 4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop \nprovisions  for  the  development  and  approval  of  methodologies,  validation,  registration, \nmonitoring,  verification  and  certification,  issuance,  renewal,  first  transfer  from  the \nmechanism  registry,  voluntary  cancellation  and  other  processes  pursuant  to  chapters \nV.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  fourth  session,  elaborated some  elements  of  the  RMPs relating  to the \noperation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  sixth  session,  elaborated  provisions  of  the  RMPs  relating  to  the \nauthorization  of  the  use  of  Article  6,  paragraph 4,  emission  reductions  (A6.4ERs)  and \nexemption from the share of proceeds for adaptation for least developed countries (LDCs) \nand small island developing States (SIDS).4 \n\nThe Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable \ndevelopment tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool) that provides means for \nactivity  participants  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  met  the  mandatory  requirements  for \nidentifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for assessing and \nenhancing  the  contributions  of  A6.4  activities  to  sustainable  development  in  line  with \nsustainable development objectives and priorities of the host Party and the sustainable \ndevelopment goals. \n\nThe Supervisory Body, at its sixteenth meeting, adopted revisions to the “Standard: Article \n6.4  activity  standard  for  programme  of  activities”  (AS-PoA)  which,  among  other  things, \nincluded the relevant requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. Additionally, the AS-PoA included \nnew provisions allowing activity participants to request a deviation through a DOE to the \nSupervisory Body prior to submitting a request for registration or request for issuance if \nthe DOE or the activity participants identify the presence of unavoidable negative impacts \nthat exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be \nremediated by consultation or mitigation. \n\n1.2.  Objectives \n\n6. \n\nThe  objective  of  the  “Article  6.4  activity  cycle  procedure  for  programmes  of  activities” \n(hereinafter  referred  to  as  this  procedure)  is  to  set  out  all  procedural  steps  and \n\n1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Processing of request for withdrawal \n\n90. \n\nUpon receipt of the request for withdrawal of a request for registration, the secretariat shall \ncheck the information provided to it as soon as possible. If the request is complete, the \nsecretariat shall reimburse the registration fee, if applicable, in accordance with Appendix \n1 and take the following actions: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIf  the  DOE  requests  the  withdrawal  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  request  for \nregistration made in accordance with paragraph 57 above, the secretariat shall not \nmark the proposed A6.4 PoA as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website; \n\nIf  the  DOE  requests  the  withdrawal  after  the  publication  of  the  request  for \nregistration  made  in  accordance  with  paragraph 57  above,  the  secretariat  shall \nmark the proposed A6.4 PoA as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website. \n\n6.  Post-registration activities \n\n6.1.  Notification  of  intention  to  include  component  projects  in  registered \n\nprogramme of activities \n\n91. \n\nThe activity participants of a proposed CP shall notify the secretariat of their intention to \ninclude  the  CP  in  a  registered  A6.4  PoA  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  or  in  a  PoA \nplanned to be registered in the future14 (hereinafter referred to as CP inclusion notification). \nThe  CP  inclusion  notification  shall  be  submitted  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the \nUNFCCC website. If the CP has already started as per the definition of the “start date” of \na CP in the activity standard, the CP inclusion notification shall be submitted within 180 \ndays after the publication of the respective PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation. \nThe CP inclusion notification shall include a summary of the CP, which shall contain, at \nminimum: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe title of the registered or proposed A6.4 PoA provided that the proposed PoA \nhas  initiated  the  global  stakeholder  consultation  process,  in  which  the  CP  is \nintended to be included; \n\nThe title of the CP; \n\nThe names of the activity participants; \n\n13  In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously. \n\n14  The PoA-DD must have at least been published for global stakeholder consultation. \n\n22 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\nThe precise geographic location of the CP; \n\nA brief description of the technologies or measures to be deployed by the CP; \n\nThe methodology to be applied by the specific A6.4 CP (if known); \n\nThe actual or planned start date of the CP; \n\nThe  type  (fixed  or  renewable),  planned  start  date  and  duration  of  the  crediting \nperiod of the CP; \n\nThe  approximate  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals \nexpected to be achieved by the CP in each year of the crediting period. \n\n92. \n\nNotwithstanding the provision in paragraph 91 above, if the start date of a proposed CP is \nafter  31  December  2020,  prior  to  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  version  01.0  of  this \nprocedure and after the start date of the first PoA period, the activity participants shall, if \nthey wish to seek inclusion of the CP in an A6.4 PoA already registered or planned to be \nregistered in the future, submit a CP inclusion notification through the dedicated interface \non  the  UNFCCC  website  referred  to  in  paragraph 91  above  within  180  days  after  the \npublication of the respective PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation. \n\n93.  Once the secretariat confirms that the required information has been duly provided, it shall \npromptly assign a unique reference number to the CP linked to the registered or planned \nto  be  registered  A6.4  PoA  and  publish  the  CP  inclusion  notification  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite. \n\n94. \n\nUpon publication of the CP inclusion notification on the UNFCCC website, the secretariat \nshall inform the host Party of the receipt of the notification. \n\n6.2.  Preparation, validation, and inclusion of a component project \n\n6.2.1.  Preparation of the component project design document \n\n95. \n\nTo include a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA, activity participants shall submit a completed \ncomponent  project  design  document  (CP-DD)  using  the  “Component  project  design \ndocument form”. The submission of the CP-DD shall be made to any DOE accredited in \nthe  relevant  sectoral  scope(s)  and  contracted  by  the  activity  participant.  Prior  to \nsubmission,  activity  participants  shall  ensure  that  the  proposed  CP  complies  with  the \ncorresponding generic CP-DD in the latest version of the registered PoA-DD, including the \neligibility criteria for the inclusion of CPs in the PoA, and the relevant requirements outlined \nin the activity standard and relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements. The \nactivity participants may submit multiple CP-DDs simultaneously. \n\n96. \n\nIf  unavoidable  negative  impacts  are  identified  by  activity  participants  that  exceed  the \nenvironmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by \nconsultation or mitigation, activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE \nas per the process for requesting a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD \nTool described in section 6.2.3 below. \n\n6.2.2.  Validation of component project design document \n\n97. \n\nThe DOE shall validate whether the project design complies with the relevant requirements \nin  the  activity  standard  and  any  other  applicable  Article  6.4  mechanism  rules  and \nrequirements  based  on  the  information  provided  in  the  CP-DD  and  any  supporting \n\n23 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\ndocumentation it has received from the activity participants as well as further information \nobtained  during  the  validation  activity.  The  DOE  shall  prepare  a  validation  report,  in \naccordance with the validation and verification standard, using the “Validation report form \nfor inclusion of CPs”. \n\n98. \n\nIf  the  DOE  or  activity  participants  identify  that  the  sum  of  the  estimated  annual  GHG \nemission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the proposed CP \ncombined  with  the  cumulative  annual  amount  of GHG  emission reductions  or  net GHG \nremovals expected to be achieved by all CPs that have already been included in the PoA \nexceeds the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals \napproved by the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above, the CP shall not be included in \nthe PoA. However, the CPs may be included in the PoA if a post-registration change to \nthe PoA is approved by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraph 142(a)(iii) below, allowing \nfor an increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG \nremovals expected to be achieved by the CPs to be included. \n\n6.2.3.  Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool \n\n6.2.3.1. \n\nSubmission of a request for deviation \n\n99. \n\nThe DOE may submit a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool to the \nsecretariat  and  seek  guidance  from  the  Supervisory  Body  on  the  acceptability  of  a \ndeviation.  Such  deviation  may  be  submitted  when  the  activity  participants  prior  to \nvalidation  or  the  DOE  during  validation  have  identified  the  presence  of  unavoidable \nimpacts that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria, and \nthat cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation. \n\n100.  To  seek  guidance  from  the  Supervisory  Body  on  the  acceptability  of  the  deviation,  the \nDOE  shall  submit  a “Deviation  from  elements  and  criteria  of  the  A6.4  SD  Tool  request \nform”  and  additional  documentation  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite. In the submission, the DOE shall provide: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nA clear and precise assessment of the case, based on evidence provided by the \nactivity  participant  as  per  the  activity  standard,  including  input  from  local \nstakeholders if any; \n\nA  description  of  the  impact  of  the  deviation  on  social,  environmental  and \nsustainable development impacts from the proposed project; \n\nA  draft  CP-DD  with  a  completed  section A:  Project  description  and  Section E: \nEnvironmental  impacts,  social  impacts  and  sustainable  development  impacts \nincluding  its  Appendices  6  (A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk \nassessment  form),  7  (A6.4  Environmental  and  social  management  plan  form) \nand/or 8 (A6.4 Sustainable development impact form). \n\n6.2.3.2. \n\nProcessing of request for deviation \n\n101.  The  secretariat  shall  issue  a  statement  of  the  deviation  consideration  fee  due,  or \nconfirmation that no fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions contained in \nAppendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE. \n\n102.  The  DOE  shall  communicate  to  the  activity  participants  the  deviation  consideration  fee \n\ndue, or a confirmation that no fee is due. \n\n24 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\n103.  The activity participants shall pay the deviation consideration fee by bank transfer, quoting \nthe unique CP reference number referred to in paragraph 93 above, within 30 days of the \nissuance to the DOE of the statement of the deviation consideration fee due. \n\n104.  The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated \n\ninterface on the UNFCCC website. \n\n105. \n\nIf the secretariat does not receive the deviation consideration fee by the 30-day deadline \nreferred to in paragraph 103 above, the request for deviation shall be deemed withdrawn. \nThe  DOE  may  submit  a  new  request  for  deviation  of  the  same  CP  anytime  thereafter, \nfollowing the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of \nthe new submission. \n\n106.  The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted requests for deviation \non the UNFCCC website for which the applicable fee has been received by the secretariat \nor for which no fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly available the schedule of \nprocessing the requests for deviation, including the expected date of commencement. The \nsecretariat  shall  schedule  the  commencement  of  the  processing  of  the  requests  for \ndeviation in accordance with the secretariat’s operational plans – that is, monthly quotas \n– which shall also incorporate any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body. \n\n107.  The secretariat shall commence the processing of the request for deviation in accordance \nwith the schedule. The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check within seven days \nto  determine  whether  the  request  submission  is  complete  in  accordance  with \nparagraph 100 above. \n\n108. \n\nIf the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or \ninconsistency  in  the  submission,  it  shall  request  the  DOE,  by  email,  to  submit  revised \ndocuments  and/or  information.  In  this  case,  the  DOE  shall  submit  the  requested \ndocuments and/or information within two days of receipt of the request. If the DOE does \nnot submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat \nshall  conclude  that  the  request  submission  is  incomplete  unless  the  DOE  provides  a \njustification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested documents and/or \ninformation in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly. \n\n109.  The secretariat shall notify the DOE of the conclusion of the completeness check. If the \nrequest  submission  is  found  incomplete,  the  secretariat  shall  also  communicate  the \nunderlying reasons to the DOE and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \nIn this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for deviation with revised documentation. \nIf the resubmission of the request for deviation is made within 28 days of the notification, \nthe  secretariat  shall  promptly  commence the  completeness  check  again;  otherwise  the \nresubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for deviation. \n\n110.  Upon  positive  conclusion  of  the  completeness  check,  the  secretariat  shall  publish  the \nrequest  for  deviation  on  the  UNFCCC  website,  and  the  request  for  deviation  shall  be \ndeemed received by the Supervisory Body for consideration. \n\n111.  Within 14 days of the date of publication of the request for deviation, the secretariat shall \nprepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for deviation \nincluding a recommendation on the course of action, or with a notification that the case \nwill be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting. \n\n112. \n\nIf the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require \nclarifications from the DOE, it shall request the DOE to submit revised documents and/or \n\n25 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\ninformation to clarify the issues within 14 days of receipt of the request. If the DOE submits \nthe  requested  documents  and/or  information  within  the  deadline,  the  secretariat, \nnotwithstanding  the  provisions  in  paragraph 111  above,  shall  promptly  finalize  the \nsummary  note  and  send  it  to  the  Supervisory  Body  within  14  days  of  receipt  of  the \nrequested documents and/or information from the DOE. If the DOE does not submit the \nrequested documents and/or information by the deadline, the secretariat shall not process \nthe request submission any further. \n\n113. \n\nIf the request submission is removed from processing in accordance with paragraph 112 \nabove, the DOE may request the secretariat, by email through a dedicated email address, \nto make a telephone call or an internet-based call to the DOE to provide clarifications on \nthe issues identified if they are not clear enough to them. Only one such request shall be \nallowed per request for deviation. In this case, the DOE shall provide the contact details \nof  the  person  to  be  called  and  the  preferred  time  slots.  The  secretariat  shall  fix  an \nappointment for the call within three days of receipt of the request. The secretariat shall \nrecord the call. \n\n114. \n\nIf the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require \ninputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts, it shall send the case to an \nappropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide inputs within seven days of receipt \nof  the  request.  In  this  case,  the  secretariat  shall,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  in \nparagraphs 111 and 112 above, finalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory \nBody within 14 days of receipt of the inputs from the expert. \n\n115. \n\nIf no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the \ncourse  of  action  referred  to  in  paragraph 111  above  within  14  days  of  receipt  of  the \nsummary  note, the recommended  course of  action  shall  be  deemed to be  the  decision \nadopted by the Supervisory Body. \n\n116.  An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair \nof  the  Supervisory  Body  through  the  secretariat,  giving  the  reasons  in  writing.  The \nsecretariat  shall  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  objection  and  make  it  available  to  the \nSupervisory Body. \n\n117. \n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the \ncourse of action more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case \nshall be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall \nbe placed on the agenda of the subsequent Supervisory Body meeting. \n\n6.2.3.3. \n\nFinalizing a request for deviation \n\n118. \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  considers  the  case  at  its  meeting  in  accordance  with \nparagraph 111 or 117 above, it shall decide on the course of action at the meeting. \n\n119.  The course of action shall be to: \n\n(a) \n\nApprove the deviation and allow submission of a request for registration with the \ndeviation; or \n\n(b) \n\nReject the request. \n\n120.  Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the \nDOE of the decision, the reasons thereof and any guidance provided by the Supervisory \nBody as applicable, and make the decision, reasons and guidance publicly available on \n\n26 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nthe UNFCCC website by publishing a ruling note within three days of the decision of the \nSupervisory Body. \n\n6.2.3.4. \n\nWithdrawal of a request for deviation \n\n6.2.3.4.1. \n\nSubmission of a request for withdrawal \n\n121.  For the following cases, the DOE shall submit a request for withdrawal of a request for \ndeviation to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website: \n\n(a) \n\nThe  activity  participants  voluntarily  wish  for  the  request  for  deviation  to  be \nwithdrawn;15 \n\n(b) \n\nThe DOE has new insights or information. \n\n6.2.3.4.2. \n\nProcessing of a request for withdrawal \n\n122.  Upon receipt of the request for withdrawal of a request for deviation, the secretariat shall \ncheck the information provided as soon as possible. The secretariat shall reimburse the \ndeviation consideration fee, if applicable, in accordance with Appendix 1. If the withdrawal \noccurs  after  the  request  for  deviation  is  published  in  accordance  with  paragraph 110 \nabove, the secretariat shall mark the deviation as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website. \n\n6.2.4.  Inclusion of component project \n\n123. \n\nIf the DOE confirms that the proposed CP complies with the requirements for inclusion of \nCPs in the registered A6.4 PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above, it shall include the \nspecific  CP  in  the  PoA  by  uploading  the  corresponding  CP-DD  through  a  dedicated \ninterface on the UNFCCC website together with the “Component project inclusion form”, \nthe  validation  report  and  a  declaration  that  the  development,  implementation  and \noperation  of  the  proposed  CP  do  not  involve  any  illegal  activities,  including  money \nlaundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery or other criminal activities. Such an upload shall be \nmade only after the registration of the PoA. \n\n124.  Once  the  documents  referred  to  in  paragraph 123  above  are  uploaded,  the  secretariat \nshall  automatically  check,  through  the  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC  website, \nwhether the inclusion of the CP would cause the total annual GHG emission reductions or \nnet removals for the registered A6.4 PoA to exceed the maximum amount approved by \nthe  host  Party  under  paragraph 25(d)  above.  If  the  total  annual  amount  exceeds  the \nmaximum  annual  amount  approved  by  the  host  Party,  the  dedicated  interface  shall \nautomatically block the processing of the uploaded documents. Otherwise the secretariat \nshall issue a statement of the CP inclusion fee due (or a confirmation that no CP inclusion \nfee is due), determined in accordance with the provisions on the registration fee contained \nin Appendix 1, and communicate it to the DOE. \n\n125.  The  processes  for  payment  of  the  CP  inclusion  fee  by  the  activity  participants  and \nsubmission of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of non-payment of \nthe CP inclusion fee within the deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions for the \nregistration fee contained in paragraphs 47-49 above, mutatis mutandis. \n\n126.  The CP described in the CP-DD, as uploaded by the DOE, will be included in the registered \nA6.4 PoA and displayed on the activity view page of that PoA on the UNFCCC website \n\n15  In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously. \n\n27 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nafter the CP inclusion fee is processed. The secretariat shall automatically notify the DOE, \nthe activity participants and the DNA of the host Party of the CP of the change in status of \nthe PoA, and shall assess, on a sample basis, the inclusion of CPs in accordance with the \nprocess referred to in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above, mutatis mutandis. \n\n127. \n\nIf the methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines applied to the \nregistered  A6.4  PoA  are  put  on  hold  or  withdrawn  for  any  reason  other  than  their \nconsolidation into a new methodology, no new CPs shall be included in the PoA until the \nPoA-DD  is  revised  to  be  in  line  with  the  revised  or  new  applicable  methodologies, \nmethodological  tools  and/or  standardized  baselines  in  accordance  with  the  process  in \nsection 6.4  below.  Any  new  CPs  submitted  before  the  put-on-hold  or  withdrawal  of  the \napplied methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines, but for which \nthe  proof  of  payment for  the  CP  inclusion fee  has  not  been  received  by  the  secretariat \nwithin the timeline specified in paragraph 125 above shall not be included in the PoA. \n\n6.2.5.  Review of erroneous inclusion of component projects \n\n128. \n\n129. \n\n130. \n\n131. \n\nIf the DNA of any host Party, any other participating Party of a registered A6.4 PoA or a \nmember  or  alternate  member  of  the  Supervisory  Body  identifies  information  that  may \ndisqualify the CP from inclusion in the PoA, they shall request a review of the inclusion of \nthe CP by notifying the secretariat within one year after the inclusion of the CP in the PoA, \nor  within  180  days  after  the  first  issuance  of  A6.4ERs  for  that  CP,  by  submitting  a \ncompleted “Component project inclusion review form”. Such request for review shall be \nrelated  to  issues  associated  with  the  compliance  of  the  CP  with  the  requirements  for \ninclusion of CPs in the PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above. \n\nIf the request is received from a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body, \nthe Chair of the Supervisory Body, in consultation with the secretariat, shall assess the \ninformation referred to in paragraph 128 above and decide, within 14 days, whether to add \nthe request for review to the agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body. \n\nIf  the  Chair  of  the  Supervisory  Body  decides  not  to  add  the  request  for  review  to  the \nagenda  of  the  next  meeting  of  the  Supervisory  Body,  the  secretariat  shall  inform  the \nrelevant Supervisory Body member or alternate member of the reasons for this decision. \n\nIf the Chair of the Supervisory Body decides to add the request for review to the agenda \nof the next meeting of the Supervisory Body, or if the request for review of the inclusion of \nthe CP has been received from the DNA of any host Party or any other participating Party \nof  a  registered  PoA,  the  secretariat  shall  accordingly  notify  the  activity participants, the \nDOE referred to in paragraph 97 above (hereinafter referred to as validating DOE) and the \nDNAs of all Parties involved in the A6.4 PoA. The activity participants and the validating \nDOE shall provide initial comments on the request for review no later than 28 days from \nthe date of notification of the review. \n\n132. \n\nIf the request for review is added to the agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory \nBody in accordance with paragraph 131 above, the Supervisory Body, taking into account \nany comments received from the activity participants and the validating DOE, shall either: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nConfirm the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA; or \n\nExclude the CP from the registered A6.4 PoA with immediate effect if it determines \nthat the CP was erroneously included in the PoA. \n\n28 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\n133. \n\n134. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body determines that the consideration of a request for review as per \nparagraph 131 above or of an issue identified by the secretariat on the basis of a sample \nassessment as per paragraph 126 above that raises concerns regarding the processes \nused to include CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA, the Supervisory Body shall initiate a full \nreview of all CPs included in the PoA. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body initiates the full review referred to in paragraph 133 above, it shall \nrequest the secretariat to contract a DOE that has not performed validation, CP inclusion \nor verification functions with regard to this registered A6.4 PoA, to review all the CPs that \nhave been included in the PoA in the one-year period or have had their first issuance in \nthe 180-day period preceding the request for review. The DOE shall submit a review report \nto the secretariat within 30 days. \n\n135.  The Supervisory Body shall establish an assessment team to analyse the DOE’s review \nreport and provide findings and recommendations to the Supervisory Body within 14 days. \nThe  assessment  team  may  discuss  the  findings  of  the  DOE’s  review  report  and  seek \ncomments from the activity participants and the validating DOE, as appropriate. Based on \nthis assessment, the assessment team shall make a finding as to whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAny specific CPs were erroneously included in the registered A6.4 PoA; \n\nCompliance  of  each  of  the  CPs  reviewed  with  respect  to  the  requirements  for \ninclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above \nwas adequately assessed by the validating DOE in accordance with the validation \nand verification standard and other Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements \napplicable at the time of inclusion. \n\n136.  The Supervisory Body shall consider both the DOE’s review report and the assessment \nteam’s findings at its next meeting for which the report and the findings have been made \navailable by the 14-day documentation deadline. \n\n137.  The Supervisory Body shall decide to exclude any specific CPs from the registered A6.4 \n\nPoA if it concludes that they have been erroneously included. \n\n138.  A CP that has been excluded after having been identified as erroneously included in the \nregistered A6.4 PoA may be re-included in the same or different registered A6.4 PoA or \nregistered as an A6.4 project. For re-inclusion in the same or different PoA, the relevant \nrequirements  in  the  activity  standard,  the  validation  and  verification  standard  and  the \nprocess in subsections 6.2.1–6.2.3 above shall apply. For registration as an A6.4 project, \nthe relevant requirements in the “Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard for projects” and \n“Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standard for projects” and the relevant \nprocess in the “Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for projects” shall apply. \n\n139.  Where, for any of the specific CPs excluded in accordance with paragraph 132(b) or 137 \nabove,  the  Supervisory  Body  determines  that  the  validating  DOE  failed  to  adequately \nassess their compliance with the requirements for inclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4 \nPoA in accordance with the validation and verification standard, the DOE shall have its \nperformance  evaluated  according  to  the  “Procedure:  Performance  monitoring  of \ndesignated operational entities” and the DOE shall acquire and transfer, within 30 days of \nthe exclusion of the CPAs, an amount of A6.4ERs equivalent to the amount of A6.4ERs \nissued for the CPs as a result of the CPs having been included to the cancellation account \nin the mechanism registry. \n\n29 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\n6.3.  Continuous engagement of stakeholders \n\n140.  Any  time  after  the  registration  of  a  PoA  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  Parties, \nstakeholders,  and  UNFCCC-admitted  observer  organizations  may  submit  comments  in \nEnglish on the registered A6.4 PoA or any CP included therein to the secretariat through \na  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  submitters  of  the  comments  shall \nprovide the name and contact details of the individual or organization on whose behalf the \ncomments are submitted. Comments from stakeholders shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nBe specific to the registered A6.4 PoA or any CP included therein; \n\nRelate to compliance with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and regulations. \n\n141.  The  secretariat  shall  promptly  make  the  comments  that  meet  the  requirements  in \nparagraph 140  above  publicly  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  where  the  PoA \ninformation  is  displayed  and  inform  the  activity  participants  of  the  publication  of  the \ncomments. \n\n6.4.  Change to registered programme of activities \n\n6.4.1.  General requirements \n\n142. \n\nIf  a  change occurred  or is  expected to  occur to a registered  A6.4  PoA, such  a  change \n(hereinafter referred to as post-registration change to the PoA) shall be approved by the \nSupervisory Body in accordance with this section to maintain the registration status under \nthe Article 6.4 mechanism. The post-registration change to the PoA shall not affect the \nCPs included until the renewal of the crediting period of the CPs, shall fall within the scope \nof the following acceptable changes and shall meet the associated conditions, as specified \nin the activity standard: \n\n(a) \n\nPermanent changes: \n\n(i)  Corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of achieved \n\nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(ii)  Permanent changes to the description of how to develop the monitoring plan \nfor  each CP  as per the corresponding  generic  CP-DD  as described  in the \nregistered PoA-DD, or permanent deviation of monitoring from the applied \nmethodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  or  the  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents; \n\n(iii)  Changes to the programme design; \n\n(iv)  Addition of a generic CP-DD; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nChanges  due  to  a  revision  of  a  methodology,  methodological  tool  and/or \nstandardized baselines applied by the generic CPs; \n\nRegistration  or  coverage  under,  or  overlap  with  other,  crediting  schemes,  other \nframeworks or environmental markets. \n\n6.4.2.  Update of documents and validation or verification \n\n143.  For  any  permanent  changes  referred  to  in  paragraph 142(a)  above,  the  activity \nparticipants shall revise the PoA-DD to reflect these post-registration changes. The activity \n\n30 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nparticipants shall submit the revised PoA-DD and any other supporting documentation to \na  DOE  accredited  in  the  relevant  sectoral  scope(s)  and  contracted  by  the  activity \nparticipants to perform validation of the post-registration change to the PoA. In this context, \nif the activity participants wish to appoint this DOE to submit the request for approval of \nthe  post-registration  change  to  the  PoA  under  the  issuance  track  referred  to  in \nparagraph 146  below,  the  selection  of  a  DOE  shall  follow  the  same  rule  referred  to  in \nparagraph 202 below. \n\n144.  For  the  permanent  change  referred  to  in  paragraph 142(b)  above,  the  validity  of  the \nversion of the methodology or methodological tool and of standardized baselines applied \nby  generic  CPs  shall  follow  the  rules  contained,  respectively,  in  the  “Procedure: \nDevelopment, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and \nthe  “Procedure:  Development,  revision,  clarification  and  update  of  standardized \nbaselines”. After the validity of the previous version of the methodology or methodological \ntool  and  of  the  standardized  baseline  expires,  the  activity  participants  may  submit  a \nrequest for post-registration change to the PoA by updating the PoA-DD including, inter \nalia, updating the eligibility criteria for the inclusion of CPs in the PoA to be in line with the \nrevised  methodologies,  methodological  tools  and/or  standardized  baselines.  However, \nsuch revision to the PoA-DD is not required if the methodologies or methodological tools \nare  revised  or  withdrawn  to  be  included  in  consolidated  methodologies  without  being \nplaced on hold, unless otherwise indicated in the report of the Supervisory Body meeting \nat  which  the  Supervisory  Body  approved  the  revised  or  consolidated  methodologies  or \nmethodological tools. \n\n145.  The  CPs  that  were  included  before  the  revision  of  the  PoA-DD  shall  apply  the  latest \nversion  of  the  PoA-DD  only  at  the  time  of  the  renewal  of  their  crediting  periods.  If  the \nactivity participants do not wish to revise the PoA-DD to apply the revised version of the \nmethodology, no new CPs shall be included in the PoA. \n\n6.4.3.  Submission of a request for approval of a post-registration change \n\n146.  After  validating  that  the  post-registration  changes  to  the  PoA  meet  all  applicable \nrequirements  for  post-registration  changes  in  the  activity  standard  by  following  the \napplicable  provisions  of  the  validation  and  verification  standard  and  other  applicable \nArticle  6.4  mechanism  rules  and  requirements,  the  DOE  shall  submit  a  request  for \napproval of post-registration change. The request for approval shall be submitted either \nprior  to  submitting  a  request  for  issuance  of  A6.4ERs  that  are  affected  by  the  post-\nregistration  change  (prior-approval  track),  or  together  with  a  request  for  issuance  of \nA6.4ERs  (issuance  track).  The  choice  of  whether  the  DOE  submits  the  request  for \napproval via the prior-approval track or the issuance track shall be at the discretion of the \nactivity participants, who may consider the indicative list of post-registration changes that \nmay be suitable for approval under the issuance track outlined in Appendix 2. \n\n147.  A request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA of the permanent changes \nreferred  to  in  paragraph 142(a)  above  shall  be  submitted  as  follows,  irrespective  of \nwhether it is under the prior-approval track or the issuance track: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAt anytime for corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of \nachieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\nNo later than the first issuance request for permanent changes to the description \nof  how  to  develop  the  monitoring  plan  for  each  CP  as  per  the  corresponding \ngeneric CP-DD as described in the PoA-DD of the registered A6.4 PoA; \n\n31 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\n(c) \n\nNo  later  than  one  year  after  the  occurrence  of  the  permanent  changes  to  the \nprogramme design. \n\n148.  A request for approval of a post-registration change to the PoA of the changes referred to \nin paragraph 142(b) above may be submitted once the Supervisory Body adopts a revised \nversion of the methodology. No new CPs shall be included in the PoA after the end of the \nvalidity period of the previous version of the methodology or methodological tool, until the \nrequest for post-registration change to the PoA is approved by the Supervisory Body. \n\n149.  Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 142 above have occurred \nor are expected to occur to the registered A6.4 PoA, the DOE shall, wherever possible, \ncombine  such  changes  into  one  request  for  approval  of  post-registration change  to the \nPoA. \n\n150.  Under both the prior-approval track and the issuance track, the DOE shall submit a request \nfor approval of post-registration change to the PoA to the secretariat through a dedicated \ninterface on the UNFCCC website, attaching: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  revised  PoA-DD  (in  both  clean  and  track-change  versions)  or  a  monitoring \nreport, as applicable, and any supporting documentation, prepared by the activity \nparticipants in accordance with the activity standard; \n\nThe validation report on the post-registration change to the PoA prepared by the \nDOE in accordance with the validation and verification standard. \n\n151.  The  secretariat  shall  issue  a  statement  of  the  post-registration  change  fee  due,  or \nconfirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with \nthe  provisions  on  the  post-registration  change  fee  contained  in  Appendix  1,  and  shall \ncommunicate it to the DOE. \n\n152.  The processes for payment of the post-registration change fee by the activity participants \nand submission of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of no-payment \nof  the  post-registration  change  fee  within  a  deadline,  shall  follow  the  corresponding \nprovisions for the registration fee contained in paragraphs 47‒49 above, mutatis mutandis. \nThe  secretariat  shall  publish  the  submitted  request  for  post-registration  change  on  the \nUNFCCC website after receiving the proof of payment of the post-registration change fee. \n\n6.4.4.  Processing of request for approval of post-registration change \n\n153.  Any post-registration changes to the PoA that may result in an increase in the maximum \nannual  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  expected  to  be \nachieved by the PoA that was previously approved by the host Party in accordance with \nparagraph 25(d) above shall be newly approved by the host Party. If the PoA has more \nthan one host Party, approval is required only from the Party(ies) relevant to the increase \nin  the  maximum  annual  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals \nresulting from the post-registration change to the PoA. Upon receiving a request for such \napproval of post-registration changes, the secretariat shall, immediately after publishing \nthe request on the UNFCCC website in accordance with paragraph 152 above, notify the \nrelevant host Party(ies) of the receipt of the request, and request them to respond with \nregard to the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net \n\n32 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nGHG removals within 60 days of the notification or in any longer timeframe to be indicated \nby the host Party(ies), through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website by: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApproving  the  increase  in  the  maximum  annual  amount  of  GHG  emission \nreductions or net GHG removals relevant to the host Party resulting from the post-\nregistration change to the PoA, or \n\nRejecting  the  increase  in  the  maximum  annual  amount  of  GHG  emission \nreductions or net GHG removals relevant to the host Party resulting from the post-\nregistration change to the PoA. \n\n154.  The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the response from the relevant host Party(ies), inform \nthe  activity  participants and  the  DOE  of  the response and  publish the  response on  the \nUNFCCC website. \n\n155.  For  processing  of  the  request  for  approval  of  post-registration  change  to  the  PoA,  the \n\nprovisions in section 5.1.2 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis. \n\n6.4.5.  Requesting review of request for approval of post-registration change \n\n156.  For requesting review of the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA, \n\nthe provisions in section 5.1.3 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis. \n\n6.4.6.  Finalizing request for approval of post-registration change if there is no request for \n\nreview \n\n157.  For finalizing the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA if no request \nfor  review  is  received  by  the  secretariat  within  the  28-day  deadline,  the  provisions  in \nsection 5.1.4  above  shall  apply,  mutatis  mutandis,  except  for  the  provision  on  the  start \ndate of the first PoA period, which is not applicable. \n\n6.4.7.  Review of request for approval of post-registration change \n\n158.  For  a  review  of  the  request  for  approval  of  post-registration  change  to  the  PoA,  the \n\nprovisions in section 5.2 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis. \n\n6.4.8.  Withdrawal of request for approval of post-registration change \n\n159.  For a withdrawal of the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA, the \n\nprovisions in section 5.3 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis. \n\n6.5.  Change to component projects \n\n6.5.1.  General requirements \n\n160. \n\nIf  a  change  has  occurred  or  is  expected  to  occur  to  an  included  CP,  such  a  change \n(hereinafter  referred  to  as  post-registration  change  to  included  CP)  shall  be  notified  in \naccordance  with  this  section to  maintain  the  inclusion  status  under  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism. The post-registration change to an included CP shall fall within the scope of \nthe  following  acceptable  changes  categories,  and  meet  the  associated  conditions,  as \nspecified in the activity standard: \n\n(a) \n\nTemporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan as described in the CP-\nDD, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk \nassessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form, and \n\n33 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nform),  applied  methodologies, \nthe  A6.4  Sustainable  development \nstandardized  baselines or  other  methodological  regulatory  documents,  including \nthe A6.4 SD Tool; \n\nimpact \n\n(b) \n\nPermanent changes: \n\n(i)  Corrections that do not have a material impact on the calculation of achieved \n\nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(ii)  Changes to the start date of the crediting period. \n\n(iii) \n\nInclusion of a monitoring plan; \n\n(iv)  Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan in the CP-DD, the A6.4 \nSD  Tool  forms  (the  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk \nassessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form \nand the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation \nof  monitoring  from  the  applied  methodologies,  standardized  baselines,  or \nother methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool; \n\n(v)  Changes to the project design; \n\n(c) \n\nRegistration or coverage under, or overlap, of the CP with other crediting schemes, \nother frameworks or environmental markets. \n\n6.5.2.  Update of documents and validation or verification \n\n161.  For the temporary deviation referred to in paragraph 160(a) above, the activity participants \nshall  describe  the  deviation  in the monitoring  report,  the  A6.4  SD  Tool  forms  (the  A6.4 \nEnvironmental and social management plan form and/or A6.4 Sustainable development \nimpact  form)  in  accordance  with  the  activity  standard  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  a \nmonitoring report in accordance with section 7.1 below and relevant provisions of the A6.4 \nSD Tool, as applicable, for the monitoring period that covers the period during which the \ntemporary deviation occurred. The deviation shall be subsequently verified by a DOE for \nrequesting  issuance  for  the  monitoring  period  in  accordance  with  sections  7.2  and  9.1 \nbelow. \n\n162.  For  any  of  the  permanent  changes  referred  to  in  paragraph 160(b)  above,  the  activity \n\nparticipants shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nRevise the CP-DD, to reflect the post-registration change; \n\nSubmit  the  revised  CP-DD  and  any  other  supporting  documentation  to  a  DOE \naccredited  in  the  relevant  sectoral  scope(s)  and  contracted  by  the  activity \nparticipants to perform validation of the post-registration change; \n\nRevise  the  PoA-DD  and  obtain  approval  from  both  the  host  Party  and  the \nSupervisory  Body  of  the  request  for  post-registration  change  to  the  PoA  as  per \nsections 6.4.4−6.4.7 above. This applies in the case of any changes to the CP that \nmay result in exceeding the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions \nor net GHG removals expected to be achieved by CPs that may be included in the \nregistered PoA, such as but not limited to: \n\n(i) \n\nAn increase of capacity leading to estimated GHG emission reductions or net \nGHG  removals  from  all  included  CPs  exceeding  the  maximum  annual \n\n34 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\namount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be \nachieved  by  CPs  that  may  be  included  in  the  registered  PoA  that  was \noriginally approved by the host Party;16 \n\n(ii)  The addition of a technology/measure, that either: \n\na. \n\nResults in estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals \nfrom  all  included  CPs  exceeding  the  maximum  annual  amount  of \nGHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  expected  to  be \nachieved by CPs that may be included in the PoA approved by the \nhost Party,17 or \n\nb. \n\nDoes not comply with the eligible technologies/measures covered by \nthe registered PoA. \n\n6.5.3.  Submission of notification of post-registration change \n\n163.  After validating that the post-registration changes to the included CP meet all applicable \nrequirements  for  post-registration  changes  in  the  activity  standard  by  following  the \napplicable  provisions  of  the  validation  and  verification  standard  and  other  applicable \nArticle 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a notification of post-\nregistration  change  to  the  included  CP  prior  to  submitting  a  request  for  issuance  of \nA6.4ERs for the PoA that are affected by the post-registration change. \n\n164.  A notification of post-registration change to the included CP of the permanent changes \n\nreferred to in paragraph 160(b) above shall be submitted: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nAny time for corrections that do not have a material impact on the calculation of \nachieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\nNo later than the first issuance request for inclusion of a monitoring plan; \n\nNo  later  than  one  year  after  the  occurrence  of  the  permanent  changes  to  the \nregistered monitoring plan of the included CP, permanent deviation of monitoring \nfrom the applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or other methodological \nregulatory documents, or the permanent change to the project design. \n\n165.  Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 160 above have occurred \nor are expected to occur to the included CP, the DOE shall, wherever possible, combine \nsuch changes into one notification of post-registration change. \n\n16  If the increase of capacity does not lead to estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals \nfrom all included CPs that  exceeds the maximum annual  amount of GHG  emission reductions or net \nGHG removals expected to be achieved by CPs, activity participants shall ensure that the additionality \nof the CP still complies with the eligibility criteria on additionality in the registered PoA-DD. \n\n17  Post-registration changes to the project design involving the addition of a technology/measure shall not \ntrigger a post-registration change to the programme design if the technology/measure is covered in the \neligibility criteria of the registered PoA and if the addition of the technology/measure in the CP does not \nlead  to  exceeding  the  maximum  annual  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals \nexpected to be achieved by CP. \n\n35 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\n166.  The DOE shall submit a notification of post-registration change to the included CP to the \n\nsecretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, attaching: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe revised CP-DD (in both clean and track-change versions) and any supporting \ndocumentation, prepared by the activity participants in accordance with the activity \nstandard; \n\nThe  validation  report  on  the  post-registration  change  prepared  by  the  DOE  in \naccordance with the validation and verification standard. \n\n6.5.4.  Processing of notification of post-registration change \n\n167.  The  secretariat  shall  issue  a  statement  of  the  post-registration  change  fee  due,  or \nconfirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with \nthe  provisions  for  the  post-registration  change  fee  outlined  in  Appendix  1,  and  shall \ncommunicate it to the DOE. \n\n168.  The processes for paying the post-registration change fee by the activity participants and \nsubmitting a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequences of non-payment of the \npost-registration change fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions \nfor the registration fee contained in paragraphs 47-49 above, mutatis mutandis. \n\n169.  The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted notifications of post-\nregistration  changes to CPs  on the  UNFCCC  website.  The secretariat  shall  assess the \nnotifications of post-registration changes on a sample basis. \n\n170.  Notifications of post-registration changes to included CPs selected for assessment by the \nsecretariat  shall  be  further  processed,  finalized  and  withdrawn,  as  applicable,  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  in  sections  5.1.2−5.3  above,  mutatis  mutandis.  If  the \nSupervisory Body rejects a change to a CP, the secretariat shall assess all other post-\nregistration  changes  of  the  same type  to  CPs  that  have  been  notified,  by  following  the \nprovisions in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above, mutatis mutandis. \n\n171.  A  notification  of  post-registration  changes  to  a  CP  that  has  not  been  selected  for \nassessment by the secretariat will be automatically displayed on the activity view page of \nthe  registered  A6.4  PoA  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  The  secretariat  shall  automatically \nnotify  the  DOE,  the  activity  participants  and  the  DNA  of  the  relevant  host  Party  of  the \nchange to the CP. \n\n172. \n\nIf the DNA of any host Party, any other participating Party of a registered A6.4 PoA or a \nSupervisory Body member or alternate member identifies information that may prohibit the \nnotified  change,  they  shall  request  a  review  of  the  notification  of  change  to  the  CP  by \nnotifying  the  Secretary  of  the  Supervisory  Body. This  request shall  be  submitted  within \none  year  of  the  notification  of  change  being  posted  on  the  UNFCCC  web  page  in \naccordance  with  paragraph 171  above,  by  submitting  a  completed  “Component  project \nactivity  inclusion  review  form”.  The  review  of  the  notification  of  change  shall  follow  the \nprovisions of section 6.2.5 above, mutatis mutandis. \n\n173.  The secretariat shall make the revised CP-DD and the validation report publicly available \non the UNFCCC website.

Notwithstanding paragraphs 167−173 above, the processing of post-registration changes \ncases relating to the A6.4 SD Tool forms, shall follow, mutatis mutandis, the provisions of \nsections 5.1.2−5.3 above. \n\n175.  Notwithstanding paragraph 174 above, for cases of post-registration changes relating to \nthe A6.4 SD Tool forms, if the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, \nidentifies issues that require inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts, \nit  shall  send  the  case  to  an  appropriate  expert.  The  selected  expert  shall  provide  their \ninputs within seven days of the receipt of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall, \nfinalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of \nthe inputs from the expert. \n\n6.6.  Change to modalities of communication \n\n6.6.1.  General requirements \n\n176. \n\nIf there is a change to the MoC statement, the focal points for scope (b) of the registered \nA6.4 PoA referred to in paragraph 34 above, shall request approval of the change from \nthe secretariat as soon as possible but no later than 90 days after the change takes place. \n\n177.  Authorized signatories or legal representatives of the activity participants, focal points, or \nDNAs  of  the  host  Party  or  any  other  Parties  participating  in  the  A6.4  PoA  may  directly \nnotify the secretariat of any issues regarding the MoC statement through a designated e-\nmail account provided in the mechanism registry section of the UNFCCC website. In this \ncase, the secretariat may request additional clarifications from the notifier. The secretariat \nmay contact any focal points or activity participants of the respective registered A6.4 PoA \nor the liquidators/administrators in cases of insolvency to request additional clarifications. \nThe secretariat shall advise the parties involved with regard to further necessary actions, \nincluding those referred to in section 6.6.2 below. \n\n178.  The secretariat may request a new submission of an MoC statement whenever it identifies \nor is notified of inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the MoC statement. The secretariat may \nprovide  specific  guidance  for  the  resubmission.  In  its  role  as  the  mechanism  registry \nadministrator,  the  secretariat  may,  after  notifying  the  focal  points  and  the  activity \nparticipants, temporarily put on hold the forwarding of A6.4ERs if the inconsistencies or \ninaccuracies  prevent  the  secretariat  from  establishing  the  focal  points  for  scope  of \nauthority (a), pending resolution of the inconsistencies or inaccuracies. \n\n179.  The focal points for scope (b) shall request approval of the change to the modalities of \ncommunication  from  the  secretariat  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite by uploading a new MoC statement using the valid version of the “Modalities of \ncommunication statement form”. \n\n180.

The \nmonitoring report shall be prepared as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA  single  monitoring  report  for  all  CPs  implemented  in  a  single  host  Party  and \nincluded  in  the  PoA  in  a  single  batch  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  single  batch  of \nCPs); or \n\nMultiple  separate  monitoring  reports  for  different  batches  of  CPs,  provided  that \nthese batches of CPs have the same monitoring period and apply the same version \nof the methodology (hereinafter referred to as multiple batches of CPs). For multi-\ncountry PoAs, each of the batches of CPs shall include only CPs monitored in the \nsame host Party. \n\n7.2.  Verification of emission reductions or removals \n\n202.  Activity  participants  shall  submit  the  monitoring  report(s)  and  any  other  supporting \ndocumentation to a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by \nthe  activity  participants  to perform  verification  of GHG  emission reductions  or  net GHG \nremovals. In this regard, the selection of the DOEs to perform the verification shall follow \nthe requirements below: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nA  DOE  that  performed  the  validation  for  registration  of  the  PoA  shall  not  be \nselected to perform the first verification for the PoA; \n\nA  DOE that  performed the  validation  for  renewal  of the  PoA  period  shall  not  be \nselected to perform the first verification for the PoA after the renewal of the PoA \nperiod; \n\nA DOE that performed the validation for inclusion of a CP shall not be selected to \nperform the first verification of the request for issuance involving that CP; \n\nA DOE that performed the validation for renewal of the crediting period of a CP \nshall  not  be  selected  to  perform  the  first  verification  of  a  request  for  issuance \ninvolving that CP after the renewal of its the crediting period. \n\n203.  The DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\nVerify whether the implementation of the CPs, and the monitoring and calculation \nof  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  comply  with  the  relevant \nrequirements  in  the  activity  standard  and  any  other  applicable  Article  6.4 \nmechanism  rules  and  requirements.  This  verification  shall  be  based  on  the \ninformation provided in the monitoring report(s) and any supporting documentation \nthe DOE has received from the activity participants as well as further information \nobtained during the verification activity; and \n\n(b) \n\nPrepare  a  single  verification  and  certification report  for  a  single batch  of CPs  or \nseparate reports for each of the multiple batches of CPs, in accordance with the \nvalidation and verification standard, using the “Verification and certification report \n\n42 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nform for PoAs”.

If the request submission does not meet the requirements of \nthe completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons \nto  the  activity  participants  and  the  DOE  and  make  this  information  available  on  the \nUNFCCC  website.  In  this  case,  the  DOE  may  resubmit  the  request  for  issuance  with \nrevised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for issuance is made within 28 \ndays  of  the  notification,  the  secretariat  shall  promptly  re-commence  the  completeness \ncheck; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for \nissuance. \n\n231.  Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject \nto  guidance  from  the  Supervisory  Body,  conduct  a  substantive  check  within  21 days  in \naccordance with the substantive checklist for requests for issuance. \n\n232. \n\nIf the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or \nmissing  basic  information,  it  shall  request  the  DOE  by  e-mail,  copying  the  activity \nparticipants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall \nsubmit the requested  documents  and/or  information  within  seven days  of  receipt  of the \nrequest. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this \ndeadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless \nthe  DOE  provides  a  justification,  by  this  deadline,  for  not  being  able  to  submit  the \nrequested  documents  and/or  information  in  time.  In  this  case,  the  deadline  shall  be \nextended accordingly. \n\n233.  The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the \nsubstantive check stage. If the request for issuance submission for which the secretariat \nconducted a substantive check does not meet the requirements of the substantive check, \nthe secretariat shall conclude that the request for issuance submission is incomplete and \ncommunicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants and the DOE and make \nthis information available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit \nthe request for issuance with revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request \nfor issuance is made within 28 days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-\ncommence the substantive check; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new \nsubmission of a request for issuance. \n\n234.  Upon a positive conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall publish \nthe request for issuance on the UNFCCC website which shall be deemed received by the \nSupervisory Body for consideration. \n\n235.

Impact of withdrawal of approval of PoA or authorized activity participant \n\n322.  For  a  registered  A6.4  PoA  from  which  any  of  the  host  Parties  withdrew  its  approval, \nrequests for issuance for GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the \nPoA before the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline \nspecified  in  paragraph 221  above.  Consequently,  the  A6.4ERs  may  be  issued  in \naccordance with sections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover \na monitoring period from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the PoA. \n\n323.  For a registered A6.4 PoA from which the host Parties or other participating Parties only \nwithdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for \nGHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  achieved  by  the  PoA  may  still  be \nsubmitted  until  the  deadline  specified  in  paragraph 221  above.  Consequently,  the \nA6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity \nparticipant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance \nand distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn \nshall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the PoA for the monitoring period \nprior to the effective date of the withdrawal of the authorization. \n\n13.  Appeals and grievances \n\n324.  Stakeholders, the activity participants, the host Party(ies) and other participating Parties, \nthrough  their  DNAs,  may  appeal  decisions of  the Supervisory  Body  in accordance  with \nparagraphs  65,  78,  241  and  257  above  or  request  that  a  grievance  be  addressed,  in \naccordance with the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 \nmechanism”.\n\n60 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-AC-003 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities \nVersion 03.0 \n\nAppendix 1.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) \nfor  the  mechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (the \nArticle 6.4).1 In accordance with the RMPs,  a proposed or registered Article 6.4 activity \n(A6.4  activity) as  well  as monitored  greenhouse gas  (GHG)  emission reductions  or  net \nGHG  removals  achieved  by  an  A6.4  activity  shall  be  independently  assessed  by  a \ndesignated operational entity (DOE) against the requirement set out in the RMPs in order \nfor the activity to be registered or renewed under the Article 6.4, or Article 6, paragraph 4 \nemission reductions to be issued.2 \n\nPursuant  to  the  RMPs,  the  Supervisory  Body  is  responsible  for  the  accreditation  of \noperational  entities  as  DOEs  and  the  establishment  of  the  requirements  and  process \nnecessary  to  operate  the  accreditation.3  The  CMA,  at  its  third  session,  requested  the \nSupervisory  Body  to  review  the  accreditation  standards  and  procedures  of  the  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM)  with  a  view  to  applying  them  with  revisions,  as \nappropriate, for the Article 6.4 by the end of 2023, and expeditiously accredit operational \nentities as DOEs.4 \n\n1.2.  Objectives \n\n3. \n\nThe objective of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation” (hereinafter referred to as this \nprocedure) is to set forth concise and transparent rules for the process of the accreditation \nof operational entities5 under the Article 6.4. \n\n2.  Scope \n\n2.1.  Scope and applicability \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nThis  procedure  sets  out  the  process  to  operationalize  the  accreditation  of  operational \nentities. \n\nThis  procedure  contains  the  series  of  rules  and  actions  that  shall  be  followed  and/or \nundertaken by applicant entities (AEs) and DOEs to obtain or maintain accreditation, as \nwell  as  by  the  Supervisory  Body  and  its  support  structure  to  conduct  accreditation \nassessments  of  whether  AEs/DOEs  comply  with \nthe  Article  6.4  accreditation \nrequirements.6 \n\n1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. Available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. \n\n2  RMPs, paragraphs 46, 51 and 57. \n\n3  RMPs, paragraphs 24(a)(i) and 24(b). \n\n4  Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(d)‒(e). \n\n5  In this procedure document, as  in the standard document, the term “operational entity”  includes both \n\napplicant entity (AE) and designated operational entity (DOE). \n\n6  The term “Article 6.4 accreditation requirements” is defined in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”. \n\n5 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n2.2.  Entry into force \n\n6. \n\nVersion 01.0 of this procedure is effective as of 31 March 2024. \n\n3.  Normative reference \n\n7. \n\nThe following documents are indispensable for the application of this procedure: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n“Article 6.4 accreditation standard”; \n\n“Procedure on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”; \n\n“Procedure for selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 \naccreditation roster of experts”; \n\n(d) \n\n“Forms used in the Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”. \n\n4.  Definitions \n\n8. \n\nIn  addition  to  the  definitions  contained  in  the  “Article  6.4  accreditation  standard”,  the \nfollowing terms apply in this procedure: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n“Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed; \n\n“Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action \nis recommended as particularly suitable; \n\n(c) \n\n“May” is used to indicate what is permitted. \n\n5.  Basics of the Article 6.4 accreditation process \n\n5.1.  Actors in the Article 6.4 accreditation process and main functions \n\n9. \n\nThere  are  several  actors  involved  in  the  Article  6.4  accreditation  process,  and  the \nresponsibility of each is as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nThe Supervisory Body takes decisions on whether to: \n\n(i) \n\nAccredit AEs as DOEs, maintain the accreditation of DOEs and reaccredit \nDOEs; \n\n(ii)  Conduct spot-checks of DOEs; \n\n(iii)  Place DOEs “under observation”; \n\n(iv)  Suspend the accreditation of DOEs for some or all sectoral scopes; \n\n(v)  Withdraw the accreditation of DOEs for some or all sectoral scopes. \n\n(b) \n\nThe Article 6.4 Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP) serves as the technical panel \nunder the guidance of the Supervisory Body and, in accordance with its terms of \nreference,  considers  the  results  of  accreditation  assessments  of  AEs/DOEs  by \nArticle 6.4 assessment teams, provides recommendations to the Supervisory Body \non  the  accreditation  status  of,  or  related  actions  for,  AEs/DOEs,  and  makes \ndecisions on areas defined as per this procedure. The AEP may consider cases \nelectronically or at its meetings; \n\n6 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nArticle  6.4  assessment  teams  (ATs)  conduct  accreditation  assessments  of \nAEs/DOEs  in  accordance  with  this  procedure,  the  “Article  6.4  accreditation \nstandard”  and  under  the  guidance  of  the  AEP,  to  evaluate  whether  AEs/DOEs \ncomply  with  the  Article  6.4  accreditation  requirements  and  submit  assessment \nreports to the AEP. ATs are selected from the accreditation roster of experts which \ncontain both external experts and secretariat staff; \n\nThe secretariat supports the implementation of this procedure; \n\nAEs/DOEs apply for accreditation, extension of accreditation for additional sectoral \nscopes  and/or  reaccreditation  and  undergo  accreditation  assessments  to \ndemonstrate compliance with Article 6.4 accreditation requirements. \n\n5.2.  Scope and status of accreditation \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\nThe  Article  6.4  accreditation  is  based  on  the  validation  and  verification/certification \nfunctions  as  well  as  on  sectoral  scopes  of  accreditation.7  An  AE  may  apply  for \naccreditation  for  both  validation  and  verification/certification  functions  in  one  or  more \nsectoral scopes. \n\nThe accreditation of a DOE is valid for five years from the date of the accreditation decision \nby the Supervisory Body. \n\nAccreditation is granted to an entity registered under applicable national laws,8 irrespective \nof  whether \nit  performs  validation  and/or \nverification/certification functions. \n\nthe  entire  organization  or  a  part  of \n\nAccreditation is granted for both validation and verification/certification functions together, \nin one or more sectoral scopes. Likewise, if accreditation is suspended or withdrawn, it is \ndone so for both validation and verification/certification functions together, in one or more \nsectoral scopes. \n\n5.3.  Objective and scope of accreditation assessments \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\nThe objective of an accreditation assessment of an AE/DOE is to assess and determine \nwhether the AE/DOE complies with Article 6.4 accreditation requirements. \n\nIf  the  validation  and/or  verification/certification  functions  are  performed  by  a  part  of  an \nAE/DOE,  and  other  parts  of  the  AE/DOE  are  involved  in  other  activities,  these  other \nactivities  may  be  assessed  as  they may  affect  validation  and/or  verification/certification \nactivities, in particular with regard to independence and impartiality. \n\n5.4.  General modalities of accreditation assessments \n\n16. \n\nThe  assessment  of  an  AE  for  initial  accreditation  and  of  a  DOE  for  reaccreditation \nconsists of the following main elements: \n\n(a) \n\nDesk  review  of  the  application  documentation  submitted  by  the  AE/DOE  with  a \nview to identifying all missing or unclear information and having the AE/DOE gather \nall  necessary  information  and  documentation,  as  a  preparation  for  the  on-site \nassessment; \n\n7  Sectoral scopes of accreditation are defined in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”. \n\n8  Please refer to section 6 of the Article 6.4 accreditation standard for more details. \n\n7 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n17. \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n(b) \n\nOn-site assessment to assess whether the documented systems of the AE/DOE, \nand  its  competence  and  operational  capability  to  perform  validation  and/or \nverification/certification  functions  comply  with  the  Article  6.4  accreditation \nrequirements. An on-site assessment shall take place at the central office of the \nAE/DOE and may also take place at any other offices of the AE/DOE or outsourced \nentities  where  the  validation  and/or  verification/certification  functions  of  the \nAE/DOE are performed. For reaccreditation, the selection of these other offices will \nbe based on the results of previous assessments (regular on-site surveillances and \nperformance assessments) and the results of the implementation of the “Procedure \non performance monitoring of designated operational entities”. \n\nIf, after completion of an on-site assessment, the AE/DOE has demonstrated compliance \nwith  all  Article  6.4  accreditation  requirements,  accreditation  or  reaccreditation  shall  be \ngranted to the AE or the DOE, respectively, for both validation and verification/certification \nfunctions  and  in  the  sectoral  scopes  in  which  the  AE/DOE  has  demonstrated  its \ncompetence to perform its validation and verification/certification functions. \n\nAfter  the  Supervisory  Body  has  granted  accreditation  or  reaccreditation,  the  DOE  is \nallowed  to  perform  its  validation  and  verification/certification  functions  in  the  accredited \nsectoral scopes. \n\nA  DOE  shall  be  subject to  performance  assessments  during  its  accredited  term.  The \npurpose of a performance assessment is to assess the implementation of the systems of \nthe DOE and its competence in an accredited sectoral scope through an assessment of a \nspecific  validation  or  verification/certification  activity.  The  number  and  types  of \nperformance assessments for a DOE are set out in section 7.1 below. \n\nA DOE shall be subject to two regular on-site surveillances, as referred to in section 8 \nbelow,  during  its  accreditation term.  The  purpose  of  a  regular  on-site  surveillance  is  to \nverify whether the systems, competence and operational capability of the DOE continue \nto meet Article 6.4 accreditation requirements over the accreditation term. A routine on-\nsite surveillance should take place at the central office of the DOE and may also include \nany  other  offices  of  the  DOE  or  its  outsourced  entities  where  the  validation  and/or \nverification/certification functions of the DOE are performed. \n\nThe Supervisory Body may decide to conduct a spot-check of a DOE at any time during \nthe accreditation term of the DOE. In addition, the AEP may initiate a spot-check of a DOE \nin  accordance  with  the  “Procedure:  Performance  monitoring  of  designated  operational \nentities”. The purpose of a spot-check is to assess whether a DOE still meets one or more \nspecific Article 6.4 accreditation requirements because of a specific concern brought up \nto the Supervisory Body regarding the compliance of the DOE with Article 6.4 accreditation \nrequirements or because of inadequate performance of the DOE monitored through the \n“Procedure:  Performance  monitoring  of  designated  operational  entities”.  A  spot-check \nmay include a desk review, and/or an on-site assessment at any office of the DOE and \noutsourced  entities  where  the  validation  and/or  verification/certification  functions  of  the \nDOE  are  performed,  and/or  an  assessment  at  the  site  of  the  Article  6.4  project  (A6.4 \nproject) or programme of activities (A6.4 PoA) being validated or verified/certified. \n\n8 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n22. \n\nFor the planning of an assessment, the risk associated with the activities, locations and \npersonnel  covered  by  the  scope  of  accreditation  shall  be  taken  into  account  while \nimplementing the following provisions:9 \n\n(a) \n\nSelection  of  the  number  and  types  of  offices,  outsourced  entities  and  validation \nand  verification/certification  activity  of  the  AE/DOE  to  be  assessed  during  the \ninitiation stage of the assessment; \n\n(b) \n\nPlanning of activities to be assessed by ATs. \n\n23. \n\nFor the conduct of assessment, the standard person-days and the number of AT members \nparticipating  in  the  assessment  are  provided  in  Appendix  9  to  this  procedure,  and  the \nstandard on-site assessment method to be used by an AT to conduct on-site assessment. \nUnder  special  circumstances  the secretariat  may  propose to deviate from  the  standard \nassessment  modalities,  based  on  the  risk  associated  with  activities,  locations  and \npersonnel covered by the scope of accreditation, including: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe number of experts on the assessment team, with a possibility to have a one-\nperson team; \n\nThe number of days to be spent by the team on-site, with a possibility to have a \none-day assessment; \n\nThe  format  of  the  assessment,  with  a  possibility  to  have  some  or  all  of  the \nassessors working remotely through, for example, videoconferencing; \n\nThe sites to be included in the assessment, with a possibility to visit only the non-\ncentral offices during the regular surveillance assessment. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\nIn  the  event  of  the  deviation,  as  referred  in  paragraph  23  above,  the  time  between \nconsecutive on-site assessments shall not exceed two years. Also, deviation shall not be \nexercised for performance assessment as referred to in section 7 below. \n\nIf a significant number (e.g. more than 10) of non-conformities (NCs) are raised by the AT \nin  either  the  initial  accreditation  assessment,  performance  assessment,  regular  on-site \nsurveillance  assessment,  reaccreditation  assessment  or  extension  of  accreditation  for \nadditional sectoral scopes assessment, an additional five days may be allocated by the \nsecretariat  to  the  time  frames  required  for  the  AE/DOE  and  the  AT,  respectively,  to \ncomplete the required actions referred to in this procedure.10 \n\n26.  Where accreditation assessments are conducted simultaneously, the following modalities \n\napply: \n\n(a) \n\nIf a regular on-site surveillance or the reaccreditation process is initiated while a \nperformance  assessment  is  still  underway,  the  outcomes  of  the  performance \nassessment should be taken into account in preparing the workplan for the regular \non-site surveillance or the reaccreditation process; \n\n(b) \n\nThe outcomes of all performance assessments, regular on-site surveillances and \nany other accreditation assessments in the current accreditation term should be \ntaken into account in preparing the workplan for the reaccreditation process; \n\n9  Please refer to section 4.3 of the Article 6.4 accreditation standard on the risks associated with validation \n\nand verification/certification conducted by a DOE. \n\n10  In this procedure, the number of days is to be considered as calendar days, unless specified otherwise. \n\n9 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(c) \n\nIf  a  spot-check  is  initiated  while  a  regular  on-site  surveillance  or  reaccreditation \nprocess  is  underway  or  will  start  shortly,  the  regular  on-site  surveillance  or \nreaccreditation  process  should  specify  the  issues  that  triggered  the  spot-check, \nwhere possible. \n\n27.  Where  there  is  evidence  identified  by  the  AT  that  a  DOE  intentionally  provided  false \ninformation,  intentionally  omitted  information  that  should  have  been  provided,  or \ndeliberately violated any accreditation requirement,11 the AT shall promptly submit a draft \nassessment report to the AEP. In this case, the following steps shall follow: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe  AEP  shall  consider  the  case  and  decide  whether  to  recommend  that  the \nSupervisory Body suspend or withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, based on the \ncriteria  contained  in  Appendix  3  to  this  procedure.  At  this  stage,  the  AEP  may \nrequest the DOE to provide information relating to the alleged conduct; \n\nIf  the  AEP  recommends  that  the  Supervisory  Body  suspend  or  withdraw  the \naccreditation  of  the  DOE,  the  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DOE  of  the \nrecommendation of the AEP. The DOE may request an independent review of the \nAEP recommendation in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 5 \nto  this  procedure,  and/or  request  a  hearing  before  the  Supervisory  Body  in \naccordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to this procedure. In these \ncases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in \naccordance with paragraph 27(d) below shall take place only after the Supervisory \nBody has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to this \nprocedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken \nplace, as applicable; \n\nIf  the  AEP  decides  not  to  recommend  that  the  Supervisory  Body  suspend  or \nwithdraw  the  accreditation  of  the  DOE,  the  AT  shall  resume  the  accreditation \nassessment; \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  shall  consider  the  recommendation  of  the  AEP,  together \nwith the independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, \nand  decide  whether  to  suspend  or  withdraw  the  accreditation  of  the  DOE  in \naccordance with provisions in section 13 or 14 below, respectively, and based on \nthe criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure; \n\n(e) \n\nIf the Supervisory Body decides not to suspend or withdraw the accreditation of \nthe DOE, the AT shall resume the accreditation assessment. \n\n28. \n\nUnder  exceptional  circumstances,  while  considering  the  assessments  conducted  under \nthe sections 6–17 below, the AEP may recommend to the Supervisory Body supported by \nproper justification that the Supervisory Body: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nConduct an on-site assessment to verify the implementation of corrective actions, \nincluding the modalities of such assessment (e.g. AT members, time frame); \n\nSubmit  any  appropriate  recommendation.  The  Supervisory  Body  shall  consider \nsuch a recommendation at its next meeting and decide on the course of action. \n\n11  The terms “intentionally” and “deliberately” mean active or passive omission or violation, which cover the \nsituations of through an act or through failure to act, through active intent or though gross negligence or \nnegligent disregard. \n\n10 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n29. \n\n30. \n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\nThe AEP may submit any appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory Body for failure \nof a DOE to meet deadlines specified in the regulations and decisions of the Supervisory \nBody or the AEP. Such recommendation shall be supported by a proper justification. The \nSupervisory Body shall consider such recommendation at its next meeting and decide on \nthe course of action, including authorizing deviation from this procedure. \n\nIf the AT identifies any findings during an assessment, these findings shall be classified \nNCs  or  major  NCs.  Any  finding  is  an  NC  if  it  is  a  non-fulfilment  of  an  accreditation \nrequirement of the Article 6.4. If a finding is not an NC, opportunities for improvement may \nbe raised by the AT and recorded in the final assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n013). A major NC is an NC that affects the capability of the management system to achieve \nthe  intended  results,  which  may  cover  the  following  circumstances  and  trigger  the \nsuspension or withdrawal as specified in Appendix 3 below:12 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIf  there  is  a  significant  doubt  that  effective  process  control  is  in  place,  or  that \nproducts or services will meet specified requirements; \n\nA  number  of  NCs  associated  with  the  same  requirement  or  issue  could \ndemonstrate a systemic failure and thus constitute a major NC. \n\nIf the AT identifies a major NC, the AT shall promptly submit a draft assessment report to \nthe AEP. In this case, the AEP shall consider the case and decide whether to recommend \nthat the Supervisory Body place the DOE under observation or suspend the accreditation \nof the DOE, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure. \n\nAppendix  5  and  Appendix  7  to  this  procedure  provide  AEs/DOEs  with  mechanisms  to \nrequest a review of AEP recommendations and AT raising NCs, respectively. \n\nAll  documentation  provided  by  an  AE/DOE  for  an  accreditation  assessment  shall  be  in \nEnglish. \n\nThe language to be used in any accreditation assessment shall be English. AEs/DOEs \nmay  use  interpretation/translation  services  where  necessary  to  ensure  effective \ncommunication with ATs. \n\n6. \n\nInitial accreditation \n\n6.1.  General \n\n35. \n\nThe process for initial accreditation comprises the following steps: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nSubmission of an application for accreditation by an entity; \n\nCompleteness check of the application documentation by the secretariat; \n\nPreparation of a workplan and appointment of an AT by the secretariat; \n\nDesk review by the AT of the documentation provided by the AE; \n\nOn-site assessment by the AT at the central office of the AE and, as applicable, at \nany other offices of the AE or outsourced entities where the AE validation and/or \nverification/certification functions are to be performed; \n\n12  ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015. \n\n11 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(f) \n\nRecommendation by the AEP to the Supervisory Body for accreditation or rejection \nof application; \n\n(g) \n\nDecision by the Supervisory Body for accreditation or rejection of application. \n\n6.2.  Application for accreditation \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\nAn  entity  that  wishes  to  be  accredited  and  designated  as  a  DOE  shall  submit  to  the \nsecretariat a duly completed application form (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-001), a declaration \nof  all  other  offices  of  the  entity  or  outsourced  entities  where  the  entity’s  validation  and \nverification/certification functions are to be performed (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-002), and \nall other documents specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure, and pay the application fee \nspecified in Appendix 9 to this procedure. \n\nThe application of an AE for accreditation shall be considered duly submitted when the \nsecretariat has received both the application documentation and the application fee. \n\nThe AE may voluntarily withdraw its application for accreditation by submitting a written \nnotification of withdrawal any time before the meeting of the Supervisory Body at which a \ndecision on the accreditation is due to be made in accordance with paragraph 79 below. \n\n6.3.  Completeness check \n\n39. \n\n40. \n\n41. \n\nThe secretariat shall start processing the application once it is considered duly submitted \nin accordance with paragraph 37 above. \n\nThe secretariat shall undertake a completeness check of the application documentation. \nIf the documentation is found incomplete, the secretariat shall inform the AE of the missing \nelements  within  seven  days  of  the  application  being  considered  duly  submitted. \nSubsequent steps of the process shall only continue once all requested documentation \nhas been received by the secretariat. \n\nThe secretariat shall publish the name of the AE and the sectoral scopes applied for by \nthe AE on the UNFCCC Article 6.4 website for global stakeholder consultation promptly \nafter  receiving  all  required  documents  from  the  AE.  Parties,  stakeholders13  and \nUNFCCC-accredited observer organizations shall have 30 days to provide any comments \nor information in respect of the AE to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the \nUNFCCC Article 6.4 website (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-025). \n\n6.4.  Appointment of the AT and preparation of workplan \n\n42. \n\nThe secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents from the AE, \nappoint  an  AT  for  the  assessment,  selecting  its  members  from  the  roster  of  experts \nestablished for the purpose of accreditation assessments (hereinafter referred to as the \nAccreditation Roster of Experts) in accordance with relevant terms of references. The AT \nshall consist of at least two members, including a team leader. The size of the AT may \nvary  depending  on  the  size  of  the  AE  and  the  expected  volume  of  validation  and \nthe  application \nverification/certification  activities \ndocumentation and the sectoral scopes of accreditation applied for. \n\nto  be  performed  by \n\nthe  AE, \n\n13  For the purpose of this procedure, all members of the public are considered to be stakeholders. \n\n12 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n43. \n\n44. \n\nThe secretariat shall inform the AE of the composition of the AT. The AE may object, in \nwriting  or  by  email  within  five  days,  to the selection of  any  AT member on  the  basis  of \nconflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. \n\nIf the AE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall, within five days \nof receipt of the objection, consider modifying the composition of the AT. If the secretariat \nconsiders the objection unjustified, or the AE does not object to the selection of any AT \nmember within the time frame referred to in paragraph 43 above, the composition of the \nAT  shall  be  deemed  accepted.  If  the  secretariat  considers  the  objection  justified  and \nreplaces a AT member, it shall inform the AE of the new AT member within the same five \ndays.  After  this,  the  same  steps  in  paragraphs  43  and  44  above  shall  repeat  until  the \ncomposition of the AT is deemed accepted. \n\n45.  Once  the  composition  of  the  AT  is  deemed  accepted,  each  AT  member  shall  sign  a \nconfidentiality  agreement  and  conflict  of  interest  declaration  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n004). \n\n46. \n\nThe secretariat shall, within five days of the end of the global stakeholder consultation, \nprepare  a  workplan  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-007)  for  the  assessment,  based  on  the \napplication documentation and the comments and information received during the global \nstakeholder consultation in accordance with paragraph 41 above, and submit it to the AEP \nfor  comments.  The  workplan  shall  identify  whether  additional  assessments  shall  be \nperformed at offices other than the AE central office. The AEP may provide comments on \nthe workplan within five days of receipt of the workplan. The secretariat shall finalize the \nworkplan within five days of the deadline for commenting by the AEP. \n\n47. \n\nThe secretariat shall provide the AT with: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAll information related to the application, including the application documentation; \n\nThe workplan for the assessment. \n\n6.5.  Assessment by the AT \n\n6.5.1.  Desk review \n\n48. \n\nThe AT shall undertake the desk review of the application documentation. \n\n49. \n\n50. \n\n51. \n\n52. \n\nIf the AT considers the information contained in the application documentation sufficient \nand adequate for the assessment, it shall prepare and finalize a desk review report (form \nA6.4-FORM-ACCR-008) and send it to the AE within 15 days of receipt of the documents \nreferred to in paragraph 47 above, and proceed with the on-site assessment in accordance \nwith paragraph 53 below. The AT shall not raise any NC at the stage of desk review. \n\nIf  the  AT  considers  that  there  is  missing,  unclear  and/or  inadequate  information  in  the \napplication documentation, the AT shall prepare a draft desk review report and send it to \nthe AE within 15 days of receipt of the documents referred to in paragraph 47 above, and \nrequest the AE to provide additional and/or amended documentation. \n\nThe  AE  shall  provide  the  requested  additional  and/or  amended  documentation  within \n20 days of receipt of the draft desk review report. \n\nNo later than 30 days after sending the draft desk review report to the AE, the AT shall \nprepare a final desk review report. If the AT, at the first round of the desk review stage, \nconsiders  the  additional  and/or  amended  documentation  adequate,  or  the  additional \n\n13 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\nand/or amended documentation inadequate, or there are still missing documents but they \ncan  be  assessed  during  the  on-site  assessment,  the  AT  shall  send  it  to  the  AE  and \nproceed with the on-site assessment in accordance with paragraph 53 below. If the AT, at \nthe second round of the deck review stage, considers that the additional and/or amended \ndocumentation is not adequate or there are still missing documents and they need to be \naddressed or submitted prior to the on-site assessment, the AT shall submit a final desk \nreview report to the AEP requesting to consider allowing the AT to conduct an additional \nround of desk review for the AEP’s consideration at its next meeting. \n\n6.5.2.  On-site assessment \n\n53. \n\n54. \n\n55. \n\n56. \n\n57. \n\n58. \n\nAfter  the  desk  review,  the  AT  shall  conduct  an  on-site  assessment  covering  all  offices \nidentified in the workplan. If there is more than one office assessed, all office assessments \nshall be compiled into one reporting, and the final decision on accreditation shall be made \nbased on the outcomes of all offices assessed. \n\nThe AT leader, taking into account the availability of the AT members and the AE and with \nsupport  from  the  secretariat,  shall  coordinate  the  dates  and  logistics  for  the  on-site \nassessment. The visit to the central office shall be conducted within 60 days of receipt of \nthe final desk review report by the AE. The visits to other offices or outsourced entities, if \nany, shall be conducted after the visit to the central office as per the workplan. \n\nIf the AE is not available for the AT visit to the central office within the time frame referred \nto in paragraph 54 above, the secretariat shall request the AE to reconfirm its interest in \nproceeding with the application for accreditation and seek justification in writing or by email \nfor the delay, and the AE shall reply to the secretariat within seven days of its receipt. The \nsecretariat shall present the case to the AEP for its decision on whether to allow the delay \nor recommend that the Supervisory Body reject the application. \n\nThe AT shall conduct the assessment at each office identified in the workplan. If the AT \nidentifies any NC, it shall prepare a non-conformity report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-012) \nfor each NC during the office visit. The AT shall provide the AE with objective evidence for \neach  NC  raised.  The  AE  shall  have  an  opportunity  to  seek  clarification  from,  and  ask \nquestions of the AT on the NCs raised. \n\nThe AE shall provide a written acceptance of any NCs that it agrees with during the AT \noffice visit. \n\nIf the AE disagrees with any NCs raised by the AT, the AE may request a review of the \nNCs  by  the  AEP  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  contained  in  Appendix  7  to  this \nprocedure. All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in  this \nsection  up  to the  step  immediately  before the  preparation  of  a  (draft)  final  assessment \nreport.  For  the  NCs  placed  under  review,  if  the  AEP  decides  to  maintain  them  in \naccordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be \naddressed  as  per  the  provisions  in  this  section  and  the  AT  shall  prepare  a  (draft)  final \nassessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft) \nfinal assessment report excluding the dropped NCs. \n\n59. \n\nThe  AT  shall  prepare  an  on-site  assessment  report  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-011)  and \nmake  it  available  to  the  AE  with  non-conformity  reports,  as  applicable,  for  information, \nwithin 15 days of the completion of the visits to all the offices as per the workplan. \n\n14 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n60. \n\n61. \n\n62. \n\n63. \n\n64. \n\n65. \n\n66. \n\n67. \n\n68. \n\n69. \n\n70. \n\nIf the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form \nA6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the AE for comments at the same time \nas the on-site assessment report. The AE shall have five days to provide comments on \nthe draft final assessment report. The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking \nunder consideration the comments of the AE, make it available to the AE for information, \nand submit it together with the on-site assessment report to the AEP within five days of \nthe deadline for commenting by the AE. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance \nwith section 6.6 below. \n\nIf the AT has identified one or more NCs, the AE shall conduct a root-cause analysis, and \npropose corrective actions for each agreed NC, including a time frame for implementation, \nwithin 15 days of receipt of the on-site assessment report. \n\nThe AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis \nand communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the AE within five days of receipt \nof them. \n\nIf  the  AE  does  not  present  a  root-cause  analysis  or  propose  corrective  actions  by  the \ndeadline referred to in paragraph 61 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, \nmake it available to the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-\nsite assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The \nAEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 6.6 below. \n\nIf  the  AT  does  not  accept  the  proposed  corrective  actions,  it  shall  provide  the  AE  with \nexplanations  to  such rejection.  The  AE  shall  have  an  additional seven  days to  propose \nrevised corrective actions. \n\nThe  AT  shall  assess  the  revised  proposed  corrective  actions  within  five  days  of  their \nreceipt. \n\nIf the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the AE does not \npropose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 64 above, the \nAT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to the AE for information, \nand submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity \nreports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance \nwith section 6.6 below. \n\nIf the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by \nthe  AT,  the  AE  shall  implement  all  the  corrective  actions  and  submit  evidence  of  their \nimplementation to the AT within 60 days of their acceptance by the AT. \n\nThe  AT  shall  assess  the  implementation  of  all  the  corrective  actions  within  10 days  of \nreceipt of the evidence of implementation. \n\nIf  the  AE  does  not  submit  evidence  of  implementation  by  the  deadline  referred  to  in \nparagraph 67 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to \nthe  AE  for  information,  and  submit  it  to  the  AEP  together  with  the  on-site  assessment \nreport and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall \nconsider the case in accordance with section 6.6 below. \n\nIf the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the \nimplementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft \nfinal assessment report and make it available to the AE for comments within seven days \nof the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions. \n\n15 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n71. \n\n72. \n\n73. \n\n74. \n\nIf the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the AE shall \nhave an additional 30 days to pursue implementation of the corrective actions and submit \nfurther evidence to the AT. \n\nThe AT shall assess the further implementation of the corrective actions within 10 days of \nreceipt  of  the  further  evidence.  Regardless  of  whether  the  AT  still  considers  the \nimplementation  of  corrective  actions  unsatisfactory,  or  whether  the  AE  has  submitted \nadequate  further  evidence  of  implementation  of  the  corrective  actions,  the  AT  shall \nprepare  a  draft  final  assessment  report  and  make  it  available  to  the  AE  for  comments \nwithin seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further implementation of \nthe corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further evidence, as applicable. \n\nThe  AE  shall  have  five  days  from  the  day  the  draft  final  assessment  report  was  made \navailable to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the \nAE  shall  not  provide  additional  evidence  of  implementation  of  corrective  actions  to  the \nNCs. \n\nThe AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments \nprovided by the AE, make it available to the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP \ntogether with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within five days of \nthe deadline for commenting by the AE. \n\n6.6.  Consideration by the AEP \n\n75. \n\n76. \n\n77. \n\n78. \n\nThe AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or \nmore  NCs  remain  open,  it  may  provide  one  final  opportunity  to  the  AE  to  resolve  the \nremaining  NCs  in  accordance  with  relevant  provisions  in  the  previous  section  of  this \nprocedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment. \n\nIf the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it \nshall recommend that the Supervisory Body accredit the AE for all sectoral scopes applied \nfor. \n\nIf the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 75 above, as \napplicable,  there  still  remains  one  or  more  open  NCs,  it  shall  recommend  to  the \nSupervisory Body one of the following options: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAccredit the AE only for some sectoral scopes applied for; \n\nReject the application for accreditation. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  inform  the  AE  of  the  recommendation  of  the  AEP.  If  the  AEP \nrecommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 77(a) and (b) above, the \nAE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. In this case, the consideration \nby the Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in accordance with paragraph 79 \nbelow  shall  take  place  only  after  the  Supervisory  Body  has  received  the  independent \nreview report referred to in Appendix 5 to this procedure and decided on the review case. \n\n6.7.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n79. \n\nThe Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the \nindependent review report, as applicable, and decide on one of the following options: \n\n(a) \n\nAccredit the AE for all sectoral scopes applied for; \n\n16 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nAccredit the AE for some sectoral scopes applied for; \n\nReject the application for accreditation. \n\n80. \n\n81. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body decides to accredit the AE for some or all sectoral scopes applied \nfor, the secretary of the Supervisory Body shall issue an accreditation certificate to the AE. \n\nThe secretariat shall maintain a public list of DOEs on the UNFCCC Article 6.4 website, \ncontaining information on: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nTheir accredited sectoral scopes; \n\nContact  details  and  addresses  of  the  central  office  and  any  other  offices  of  the \nentity  as  well  as  those  of  the  outsourced  entities  where  the  validation  and \nverification/certification functions are performed; \n\n(c) \n\nA summary of the requests for registration and issuance submitted per DOE. \n\n7.

General \n\n82. \n\nThe  number  and  types  of  performance  assessments  for  planning  purposes  should  be \ndetermined as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nA minimum of three performance assessments, reasonably spaced along with the \nregular  surveillances,  in  the  five-year  accreditation  term  for  any  DOE  as  the \nmandatory basis;14 \n\n(b) \n\nAdditional performance assessment(s) based on the volume of work as follows: \n\n(i)  One additional performance assessment on a validation activity per year if \nthe  DOE  submitted  50  or  more  requests  for  registration  in  the  previous \n12 months; \n\n(ii)  One additional performance assessment on a verification activity per year if \nthe  DOE  submitted  150 or  more  requests  for  issuance  in  the  previous \n12 months; \n\n(c) \n\nAddition  or  reduction  of  the  number  of  performance  assessments  based  on  the \noutput  of  the  “Procedure:  Performance  monitoring  of  designated  operational \nentities” by: \n\n(i)  One  additional  performance  assessment  on  a \n\nvalidation  or \nverification/certification activity if the indicator I2 is in the yellow zone for the \nregistration  or  issuance  process,  respectively,  for  three  consecutive \nmonitoring periods; \n\n(ii)  One less performance assessment on a validation or verification/certification \nactivity if the indicator I2 is in the green zone for the registration or issuance \nprocess, respectively, for four consecutive monitoring periods. This reduction \n\n14  The total number of performance assessments may increase to one performance assessment per year \n\nwithin the five-year accreditation term based on the risk-based approach analysis. \n\n17 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\nin the number of performance assessments shall be effected only from those \nadded in accordance with paragraph 82(b) above. \n\n83. \n\n84. \n\nThe launching of performance assessments is subject to a DOE notifying the secretariat, \nthrough a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the timing of the site inspection \nof the proposed A6.4 activity related to requests for registration or renewal or requests for \nissuance, as per the provisions related to such notification as defined under “Procedure: \nArticle 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” and “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle \nprocedure for programme of activities”. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  make  at  least  one  submission  of  a  request  for  registration,  renewal  or \nissuance  under  the  Article  6.4  activity  cycle  within  the  five-year  accreditation  term  to \nensure the implementation of the established quality management system of the 6.4 DOE \nand its competence; otherwise, the DOE’s reaccreditation shall be rejected as highlighted \nunder paragraph 175(c) below. \n\n7.2. \n\nInitiation \n\n85. \n\n86. \n\nfor \nThe  secretariat  shall  select  validation  and  verification/certification  activities \nperformance  assessments  to  be  conducted  for  a  DOE  based  on  the  notification  of  site \ninspection by the DOE for requests for registration or renewal or requests for issuance, as \nhighlighted under paragraph 83 above. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  notify  the  DOE  of  the  validation  or  verification/certification  activity \nselected  for  a  performance  assessment.  The  DOE  shall  submit  to  the  secretariat  the \ndocumentation for the assessment specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure within five \ndays of receipt of the notification. \n\n7.3.  Completeness check \n\n87. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  undertake  a  completeness  check  of  the  documentation  for  the \nassessment. If any of the required documents are not received by the secretariat by the \ndeadline referred to in paragraph 86 above, the secretariat shall send a reminder to the \nDOE  within  seven  days  of  the  deadline.  If  any  of  the  required  documents  are  still  not \nreceived by the secretariat within seven days of sending the reminder, the secretariat shall \nreport the case to the AEP, and the AEP shall make a recommendation to the Supervisory \nBody to place the DOE under observation. \n\n7.4.  Appointment of the AT \n\n88. \n\nThe secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents, including the \nconfirmation  of  the  on-site  inspection  date  from  the  DOE,  appoint  an  AT  for  the \nassessment, selecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts. The AT shall \nconsist of a team leader and an expert qualified in the sectoral scopes of the A6.4 project \nor  A6.4  PoA  in  the  validation  or  verification/certification  activity  selected  for  the \nperformance assessment. The size of the AT may be reduced or increased to ensure that \nthe competence of the AT is maintained and that the AT may adequately observe the DOE \nverification team during a performance assessment based on a verification/certification. \n\n89. \n\nThe secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object, \nin writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of \nconflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. \n\n18 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n90. \n\nIf  the  DOE  objects  to  the  selection  of  an  AT  member,  the  secretariat  shall  consider \nmodifying  the  composition  of  the  AT  within  five  days  of  receipt  of  the  objection.  If  the \nsecretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection \nof any AT member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 89 above, the AT shall \nbe deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and replaces a AT \nmember, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within the same five days. After \nthis, the same steps in paragraphs 89 and 90 above shall repeat until the composition of \nthe AT is deemed accepted. \n\n91.

The DOE \nshall submit the requested additional documents within five days of receipt of the request. \n\nA  performance assessment  on  a  validation  and verification/certification  activity  shall  be \nbased on the observation of the validation and verification carried out by the DOE team \nduring the on-site inspection at the project activity site(s) and the desk-review evaluation \nof a draft validation and verification report and other documentary evidence submitted by \nthe  DOE.15  Regarding  the  on-site  inspection,  the  DOE  shall,  with  the  support  of  the \nsecretariat, coordinate the dates and logistics for the visit to the project activity site(s) by \nits validation and verification team with the AT. The DOE shall submit to the AT a draft \nvalidation  and  verification  report,  duly  reviewed  internally  for  its  completeness  and \nadequacy, including Corrective Action Requests, Clarification Requests and/or Forward \nAction Requests, within 45 days of the on-site inspection. \n\nThe  AT  shall  conduct  the  assessment  of  the  documentation,  including  any  additional \ndocuments that have been requested by the AT. \n\nThe AT shall, within 15 days of receipt of the documentation for the assessment, prepare \na  draft  performance  assessment  report  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-014  or  A6.4-FORM-\nACCR-015, as applicable), containing findings including those of potential NCs, objective \nevidence for each finding and a conclusion on whether the DOE conducted the validation \nor  verification/certification  activity  competently,  and  make  it  available  to  the  DOE  for \ncomments. \n\nThe DOE shall have five days to seek or provide clarification regarding the findings from \nor to the AT. The DOE may also submit additional documents to support its clarification. \n\nThe AT shall raise an NC for each finding that the AT concludes to be an issue showing \nnon-compliance with an Article 6.4 accreditation requirement, prepare a non-conformity \n\n15  In accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects” and the “Article 6.4 \nvalidation and verification standard for programmes of activities”, an on-site inspection by a DOE may \nbe  exempted  from  certain  verification/certification  activities.  If  such  verification/certification  activity  is \nchosen for a performance assessment, the assessment may be based on the remote inspection and/or \nthe desk-review evaluation. \n\n19 of 66 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\nreport for each NC, as applicable, finalize the performance assessment report, including \na  conclusion  on  whether  the  DOE  conducted  the  validation/verification  activity \ncompetently, and make them available to the DOE for information within five days of the \ndeadline for commenting by the DOE. \n\n99. \n\nIf  the  AT  concludes  that  the  DOE  conducted  the  validation  or  verification/certification \nactivity incompetently, the AT shall submit the performance assessment report to the AEP \nwithin five days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. The AEP shall consider the \ncase in accordance with section 7.6 below. In the interim, any NCs shall continue to be \naddressed in accordance with the relevant provisions of this section. \n\n100.  The DOE shall consider the performance assessment report and non-conformity reports \nand provide a written acceptance of any NCs that it agrees with within five days of receipt \nof the reports. \n\n101. \n\n102. \n\nIf the DOE disagrees with any NCs raised by the AT, the DOE may request a review of \nthe  NCs  by  the  AEP  in accordance  with  the  provisions  contained  in Appendix  7  to this \nprocedure. All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in this \nsection  up  to the  step  immediately  before  the  preparation  of  a  (draft)  final  assessment \nreport.  For  the  NCs  placed  under  review,  if  the  AEP  decides  to  maintain  them  in \naccordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be \naddressed  as  per  the  provisions  in  this  section  and  the  AT  shall  prepare  a  (draft)  final \nassessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft) \nfinal assessment report excluding the dropped NCs. \n\nIf the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form \nA6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the DOE for comments at the same time \nas  the  performance  assessment  report.  The  DOE  shall  have  five  days  to  provide \ncomments on the draft final assessment report. The AT shall finalize the final assessment \nreport  taking  into  account  the  comments  of  the  DOE,  make  it  available  to  the  DOE  for \ninformation, and submit it to the  AEP together with the performance assessment report \nwithin five days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. The AEP shall consider the \ncase in accordance with section 7.6 below. \n\n103. \n\nIf the AT has identified one or more NCs, the DOE shall conduct a root-cause analysis \nand  propose  corrective  actions  for  each  agreed  NC,  including  a  time  frame  for \nimplementation,  within  15 days  of  receipt  of  the  performance  assessment  report  and \nnon-conformity reports. \n\n104.  The AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis \nand communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the DOE within five days of receipt \nof them. \n\n105. \n\nIf the DOE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the \ndeadline  referred  to  in  paragraph  103  above,  the  AT  shall  prepare  a  final  assessment \nreport, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with \nthe performance assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the \ndeadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 7.6 below. \n\n106. \n\nIf the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the DOE with \nexplanations to such rejection. The DOE shall have an additional seven days to propose \nrevised corrective actions. \n\n20 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n107.  The  AT  shall  assess  the  revised  proposed  corrective  actions  within  five  days  of  their \n\nreceipt. \n\n108. \n\nIf the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the DOE does not \npropose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 106 above, \nthe  AT  shall  prepare  a  final  assessment  report,  make  it  available  to  the  DOE  for \ninformation, and submit it to the AEP together with the performance assessment report \nand non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the \ncase in accordance with section 7.6 below. \n\n109. \n\nIf the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by \nthe AT, the DOE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their \nimplementation to the AT within 30 days of their acceptance by the AT. \n\n110.  The  AT  shall  assess  the  implementation  of  all  the  corrective  actions  within  10 days  of \n\nreceipt of the evidence of implementation. \n\n111. \n\nIf  the  DOE  does  not  submit  evidence  of  implementation  by  the  deadline  referred  to  in \nparagraph 109 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to \nthe  DOE  for  information,  and  submit  it  to  the  AEP  together  with  the  performance \nassessment report and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The \nAEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 7.6 below. \n\n112. \n\nIf the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the \nimplementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft \nfinal assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments within seven days \nof the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions. \n\n113. \n\nIf the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the DOE \nshall have an additional 15 days to pursue the implementation of the corrective actions \nand submit further evidence to the AT. \n\n114.  The  AT  shall  assess  the  further  implementation  of  corrective  actions  within  10  days  of \nreceipt  of  the  further  evidence.  Regardless  of  whether  the  AT  still  considers  the \nimplementation  of  corrective actions  unsatisfactory,  or  whether the  DOE has  submitted \nadequate  further  evidence  of  implementation  of  the  corrective  actions,  the  AT  shall \nprepare  a  draft  final  assessment  report,  including  a  conclusion  on  whether  the  DOE \nconducted the validation/verification activity competently, and make it available to the DOE \nfor  comments  within  seven  days  of  the  completion  of  the  assessment  of  the  further \nimplementation  of  the  corrective  actions,  or  the  deadline  for  submission  of  further \nevidence, as applicable. \n\n115.  The DOE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made \navailable to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the \nDOE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the \nNCs. \n\n116.  The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments \nprovided by the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the \nAEP together with the performance assessment report and non-conformity reports within \nfive days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. \n\n21 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n7.6.  Consideration by the AEP \n\n117.  The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or \nmore  NCs  remain  open,  it  may  provide  one final  opportunity to the  DOE to  resolve the \nremaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in the previous section of the \nprocedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment. \n\n118. \n\nIf the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it \nshall  inform  the  Supervisory  Body  of  the  completion  of  the  performance  assessment. \nHowever, \nthe  validation  or \nverification/certification activity incompetently or that at least one NC requires follow-up to \nverify  the  effectiveness  of  the  corrective  action,  it  may  make  a  recommendation  to  the \nSupervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 28 above. \n\nthe  DOE  conducted \n\nthe  AEP  considers \n\nthat \n\nif \n\n119. \n\nIf the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 117 above, \nas applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend one of the \nfollowing options to the Supervisory Body: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nPlace the DOE under observation, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 \nto this procedure; \n\nSuspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes, based on \nthe criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure; \n\n(c) \n\nA course of action in accordance with paragraph 28 above. \n\n120.  The  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DOE  of  the  recommendation  of  the  AEP.

The workplan shall identify the offices where the regular on-site surveillance \nassessment will be conducted and provide the instructions to the AT on how to assess the \ncorrective  actions  that  were  implemented  by  the  DOE  to  address  the  NC(s)  raised  in \nprevious assessments. The workplan may also include that the AT is to observe a meeting \nof the impartiality committee of the DOE. \n\n130. \n\nIn  preparing  the  draft  workplan  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-007)  and  in  identifying  which \nsites to visit, the secretariat shall consider: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe documents submitted by the DOE; \n\nThe number of employees of the DOE; \n\n23 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nThe functions performed at each office; \n\nThe required technical competence of the AT; \n\nThe  performance  of  the  DOE  as  monitored  through  the  implementation  of  the \n“Procedure on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”; \n\nThe volume of the DOE’s validation and verification/certification work; \n\nAny other influencing factors. \n\n131.  The AEP may provide comments on the draft workplan within five days of receipt of the \nworkplan. The secretariat shall finalize the workplan within five days of the deadline for \ncommenting by the AEP. \n\n132.  The secretariat shall, within five days of finalization of the workplan, appoint an AT for the \n\nassessment, selecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts. \n\n133.  The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object, \nin writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of \nconflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. \n\n134. \n\nIf  the  DOE  objects  to  the  selection  of  an  AT  member,  the  secretariat  shall  consider \nmodifying  the  composition  of  the  AT  within  five  days  of  receipt  of  the  objection.  If  the \nsecretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection \nof  any  AT  member  within  the  time  frame  referred  to  in  paragraph  133  above,  the \ncomposition of the AT shall be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection \njustified and replaces a AT member, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within \nthe same five days. After this, the same steps in paragraphs 133 and 134 above shall be \nrepeated until the composition of the AT is deemed accepted. \n\n135.

All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in this \nsection  up  to the  step  immediately  before  the  preparation  of  a  (draft)  final  assessment \nreport.  For  the  NCs  placed  under  review,  if  the  AEP  decides  to  maintain  them  in \naccordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be \naddressed as  per  the provisions  in  this section, and the AT  shall  prepare a (draft)  final \nassessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft) \nfinal assessment report excluding the dropped NCs. \n\n142.  The  AT  shall  prepare  an  on-site  assessment  report  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-011)  and \nmake it available to the DOE with non-conformity reports, as applicable, for information, \nwithin 15 days of the completion of the visits to all the offices as per the workplan. \n\n143. \n\nIf the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form \nA6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the DOE for comments at the same time \nas the on-site assessment report. The DOE shall  have five days from the day the draft \nfinal assessment report was made available to it to provide comments on the draft final \nassessment  report.  The  AT  shall  finalize  the  final  assessment  report  taking  under \nconsideration the comments of the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and \nsubmit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report within five days of the \ndeadline for commenting by the DOE. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with \nsection 8.6 below. \n\n144. \n\nIf the AT has identified one or more NCs, the DOE shall conduct a root-cause analysis \nand  propose  corrective  actions  for  each  agreed  NC,  including  a  time  frame  for \nimplementation, within 15 days of receipt of the on-site assessment report. \n\n145.  The AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis \nand communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the DOE within five days of receipt \nof them. \n\n146. \n\nIf the DOE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the \ndeadline  referred  to  in  paragraph  144  above,  the  AT  shall  prepare  a  final  assessment \nreport, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with \nthe  on-site  assessment  report  and  non-conformity  reports  within  seven  days  of  the \ndeadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 8.6 below. \n\n147. \n\nIf the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the DOE with \nexplanations to such rejection. The DOE shall have an additional seven days to propose \nrevised corrective actions. \n\n148.  The AT shall assess the revised proposed corrective actions within five days of receipt of \n\nthem. \n\n149. \n\nIf the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the DOE does not \npropose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 147 above, \nthe  AT  shall  prepare  a  final  assessment  report,  make  it  available  to  the  DOE  for \n\n25 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\ninformation, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-\nconformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in \naccordance with section 8.6 below. \n\n150. \n\nIf the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by \nthe AT, the DOE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their \nimplementation to the AT within 30 days of their acceptance by the AT. \n\n151.  The  AT  shall  assess  the  implementation  of  all  the  corrective  actions  within  10 days  of \n\nreceipt of the evidence of implementation. \n\n152. \n\nIf  the  DOE  does  not  submit  evidence  of  implementation  by  the  deadline  referred  to  in \nparagraph 150 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to \nthe DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment \nreport and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall \nconsider the case in accordance with section 8.6 below. \n\n153. \n\nIf the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the \nimplementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft \nfinal assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments within seven days \nof the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions. \n\n154. \n\nIf the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the DOE \nshall have an additional 15 days to pursue implementation of the corrective actions and \nsubmit further evidence to the AT. \n\n155.  The AT shall assess the further implementation of the corrective actions within 10 days of \nreceipt  of  the  further  evidence.  Regardless  of  whether  the  AT  still  considers  the \nimplementation  of  corrective actions  unsatisfactory,  or  whether the  DOE has  submitted \nadequate  further  evidence  of  implementation  of  the  corrective  actions,  the  AT  shall \nprepare a draft final assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments \nwithin seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further implementation of \nthe corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further evidence, as applicable. \n\n156.  The DOE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made \navailable to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the \nDOE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the \nNCs. \n\n157.  The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments \nprovided by the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the \nAEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within five \ndays of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. \n\n8.6.  Consideration by the AEP \n\n158.  The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or \nmore  NCs  remain  open,  it may  provide  one final  opportunity to the  DOE to  resolve the \nremaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in the previous section of this \nprocedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment. \n\n26 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n159. \n\n160. \n\nIf the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it \nshall  inform  the  Supervisory  Body  of  the  successful  completion  of  the  regular  on-site \nsurveillance. \n\nIf the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 158 above, \nas  applicable,  there  still  remains  one  or  more  open  NCs,  it  shall  recommend  to  the \nSupervisory Body, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure, one of \nthe following options: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nPlace the DOE under observation; \n\nSuspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes. \n\n161.  The  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DOE  of  the  recommendation  of  the  AEP.  If  the  AEP \nrecommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 160(a) and (b) above, the \nDOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with \nthe provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation is \nthe option referred to in paragraph  160(b) above, the DOE may also request a hearing \nbefore the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to \nthis  procedure. In these cases, the  consideration  by  the  Supervisory  Body  on  the  AEP \nrecommendation in accordance with paragraph 162 below shall take place only after the \nSupervisory Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to \nthis procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken place, \nas applicable. \n\n8.7.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n162.  The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the \nindependent  review  report  and/or  the  hearing  of  the  DOE,  as  applicable,  and  decide, \nbased on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure, on one of the following \noptions: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nMaintain the accreditation of the DOE; \n\nPlace the DOE under observation; \n\nSuspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes. \n\n163.  The conditions of under-observation status and suspension of accreditation are given in \nAppendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and lifting an under-observation \nstatus and a suspension of accreditation are defined in section 12 and section 13 below, \nrespectively. \n\n164. \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  decides  to  place  the  DOE  under  observation  or  suspend  its \naccreditation, the secretariat shall promptly update the status of the DOE on the public list \nof DOEs referred to in paragraph 81 above. \n\n9.  Reaccreditation \n\n9.1.  Application for reaccreditation \n\n165.  A DOE that wishes to be re-accredited after the expiry of the current accreditation term \nshall apply for reaccreditation between 10 and 12 months before the expiry  date of the \ncurrent accreditation term. \n\n27 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n166.  When  applying  for  reaccreditation,  the  DOE  may  apply  for  accreditation  in  additional \n\nsectoral scopes as referred to in section 10 below. \n\n167.  The  DOE  shall  submit  to  the  secretariat  a  duly  completed  application  form  (form  A6.4-\nFORM-ACCR-001) and all other documents specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure and \npay the application fee specified in Appendix 9 to this procedure. \n\n168.  The application of a DOE for reaccreditation shall be considered duly submitted when the \nsecretariat has received both the application documentation and the application fee. \n\n9.2.  General modalities \n\n169.  The  provisions  and  timelines  in  sections  6.3–6.5  above  regarding  the  completeness \ncheck,  appointment  of  an  AT,  preparation  of  a  workplan,  desk  review  and  on-site \nassessment shall apply mutatis mutandis, except for: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nPublication  of  the  name  of  the  DOE  and  the  sectoral  scopes  applied  for  global \nstakeholder consultation, which is not necessary; \n\nThe  time  frame  for  implementing  corrective  actions  referred  to  in  paragraph  67 \nabove, which shall be 30 days instead of 60 days; \n\nThe  additional  time  frame  for  pursuing  the  implementation  of  corrective  actions \nreferred to in paragraph 71 above, which shall be 15 days instead of 30 days; \n\nThe workplan, which shall provide the instructions to the AT on how to assess the \ncorrective actions that were implemented by the DOE to address the NC(s) raised \nin previous assessments. \n\n170.  The performance assessments initiated but not completed before a DOE is re-accredited \nshall remain in effect regardless of the proceeding of reaccreditation assessment. \n\n171. \n\nIn  case  of  a  delay  in  the  reaccreditation  process,  the  AEP  may  recommend  that  the \nSupervisory Body extend the accreditation of the DOE accordingly and the Supervisory \nBody shall consider the AEP’s recommendation in the next meeting. The extension shall \nbe granted only if the DOE has applied for reaccreditation within the time frame referred \nto in paragraph 165 above and the DOE is not fully responsible for the delay in the process \nof reaccreditation. \n\n172.  The  DOE  may  voluntarily  withdraw  its  application  for  reaccreditation  by  submitting  a \nwritten notification of withdrawal any time before the meeting of the Supervisory Body at \nwhich  a  decision  on  the  reaccreditation  is  due  to  be  made  in  accordance  with \nparagraph 177 below. \n\n9.3.  Consideration by the AEP \n\n173.  The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or \nmore  NCs  remain  open,  it  may  provide  one final  opportunity to the  DOE to  resolve the \n\n28 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n174. \n\n175. \n\nremaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in section 6.5 above, before the \nAEP concludes the assessment. \n\nIf the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it \nshall recommend that the Supervisory Body re-accredit the DOE for all sectoral scopes \napplied for. \n\nIf the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 173 above, \nas  applicable,  there  still  remains  one  or  more  open  NCs,  it  shall  recommend  to  the \nSupervisory Body one of the following options: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nRe-accredit the DOE only for some sectoral scopes applied for; \n\nTemporarily  extend  the  accreditation  of  the  DOE  and,  based  on  the  criteria \ncontained in Appendix 3 to this procedure: \n\n(i) \n\nPlace the DOE under observation; or \n\n(ii)  Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for all sectoral scopes; \n\n(c) \n\nReject the application for reaccreditation. \n\n176.  The  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DOE  of  the  recommendation  of  the  AEP.  If  the  AEP \nrecommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 175(a), (b) and (c) above, \nthe DOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance \nwith the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation \nis one of the options referred to in paragraph 175(b)(ii) and (c) above, the DOE may also \nrequest  a  hearing  before  the  Supervisory  Body  in  accordance  with  the  provisions \ncontained  in  Appendix  8  to  this  procedure.  In  these  cases,  the  consideration  by  the \nSupervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in accordance with paragraph 177 below \nshall  take  place  only  after  the  Supervisory  Body  has  received  the  independent  review \nreport referred to in Appendix 5 to this procedure and decided on the review case, and \nonly after the hearing has taken place, as applicable. \n\n9.4.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n177.  The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the \nindependent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, and decide on \none of the following options: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nRe-accredit the DOE for all sectoral scopes applied for; \n\nRe-accredit the DOE only for some sectoral scopes applied for; \n\nTemporarily  extend  the  accreditation  of  the  DOE  and  based  on  the  criteria \ncontained in Appendix 3 to this procedure: \n\n(i) \n\nPlace the DOE under observation; or \n\n(ii)  Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for all sectoral scopes; \n\n(d) \n\nReject the application for reaccreditation. \n\n178.  The conditions of under-observation status and suspension of accreditation are given in \nAppendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and lifting an under-observation \nstatus and a suspension of accreditation are defined in section 12 and section 13 below, \nrespectively. \n\n29 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n179. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body decides to re-accredit the DOE, the secretary of the Supervisory \nBody shall issue an accreditation certificate to the DOE. The new accreditation term shall \nbe valid for five years from the date of expiry of the previous accreditation term. \n\n180.  The  secretariat  shall  promptly  update the  status of  the  DOE  on the  public  list  of  DOEs \n\nreferred to in paragraph 81 above. \n\n10.  Accreditation for additional sectoral scopes \n\n181.  A  DOE  may apply for  accreditation  for  additional  sectoral  scopes  at  any  time  within its \n\naccreditation term. \n\n182.  The AEP shall consider the application and decide on the scope of the assessment, taking \ninto  account  the  sectoral  scopes  for  which  the  DOE  is  currently  accredited,  and  the \nadditional sectoral scopes applied for. \n\n183.  The  provisions  and  timelines  defined  in  sections  6.3–6.7  above  regarding  the \ncompleteness check, appointment of a AT, preparation of a workplan, desk review, on-\nsite  assessment,  and  consideration  by  the  AEP  and  the  Supervisory  Body  shall  apply \nmutatis mutandis, except for: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nPublication of the name of the DOE and the additional sectoral scopes applied for \nglobal stakeholder consultation, which is not necessary; \n\nThe  time  frame  for  implementing  corrective  actions  referred  to  in  paragraph  67 \nabove, which shall be 30 days instead of 60 days; \n\nThe  additional  time  frame  for  pursuing  the  implementation  of  corrective  actions \nreferred to in paragraph 71 above, which shall be 15 days instead of 30 days. \n\n184.  An accreditation for a maximum of three additional sectoral scopes may be granted based \non an assessment performed and consideration given in accordance with sections 6.5–\n6.7 above but without conducting any site visit. \n\n185.  The accreditation for additional sectoral scopes of a DOE shall be valid only until the expiry \nof the existing accreditation term of the DOE. It is noted that the application of additional \nsectoral scope can also be applied along with the application of reaccreditation as referred \nin to paragraph 166 above. \n\n11.  Spot-check \n\n11.1.  Initiation \n\n186.  The Supervisory Body may decide to conduct a spot-check of a DOE at any time during \n\nits accreditation term. \n\n187.  The  consideration by the  Supervisory  Body to conduct  a spot-check  of a DOE  may be \n\ntriggered by, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  review  process  conducted  by  the  Supervisory  Body  on  a  request  for \nregistration or a request for issuance submitted by the DOE; \n\nInformation received from a third party on the possible inadequate performance of \nthe  DOE  in  its  validation  or  verification/certification  activities  as  well  as  on  any \nchanges which may significantly impair the compliance of the DOE with Article 6.4 \n\n30 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\naccreditation  requirements,  such  as  changes  in  ownership,  organizational \nstructure, internal policies and procedures, resources and personnel; \n\n(c) \n\nA  recommendation  of  the  AEP  based  on,  inter  alia,  the  result  of  handling \ncomplaints against the DOE in accordance with Appendix 6 to this procedure. \n\n188.  The reason that triggered a spot-check shall remain confidential. \n\n189.  The Supervisory Body may decide to immediately suspend the accreditation of the DOE \nunder a spot-check. If the Supervisory Body decides to do so, it shall provide the DOE \nwith an opportunity for a hearing at a Supervisory Body meeting prior to suspending the \naccreditation. Also in this case, the assessment for lifting the suspension in accordance \nwith section 13 below shall not be initiated until and unless the Supervisory Body decides \nto  continue  the  suspension  based  on  the  outcome  of  the  spot-check  conducted  in \naccordance with the present section. \n\n190.  The Supervisory Body, once it has decided to conduct a spot-check, shall agree on the \nscope of the spot-check. For this purpose, if the AEP recommends that the Supervisory \nBody conduct a spot-check, it shall also propose the scope of the spot-check. \n\n191.  The  AEP  shall  initiate  a  spot-check  of  a  DOE  if  its  performance  on  validation  or \nverification/certification  activities  as  monitored  through  the  implementation  of  the \n“Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational entities” declines, as the \nfinal version of a monitoring report prepared in accordance with the procedure shows that \nthe DOE is in the red zone for the indicators I2 or I3. \n\n192.  Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 191 above, the AEP may not initiate a spot-\ncheck of a DOE that has reached the red zone of  indicators I2 or I3 if the following two \nconditions are met: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  issues  in  the  scope  of  the  spot-check  have  been  covered  and  resolved  in \nrecent assessments; \n\nA  visit  to  the  central  office  of  the  DOE  under  a  regular  on-site  surveillance  or \nreaccreditation assessment is planned to take place in the next 90 days; in such \ncase, the issues envisaged for the spot-check shall be considered and addressed \nin the regular surveillance or reaccreditation assessment. \n\n193. \n\nIf the AEP initiates a spot-check of a DOE in accordance with paragraph  191 above, it \nshall agree on the scope of the spot-check and inform the Supervisory Body of the initiation \nof the spot-check and the scope. The scope shall be based on the information gathered \nin  the  implementation  of  the  “Procedure:  Performance  monitoring  of  designated \noperational entities”. \n\n194.  The scope of a spot-check shall include the following: \n\n(a) \n\nIdentification of the type and the site of the spot-check, such as: \n\n(i)  On-site assessment at the central office of the DOE and/or any other offices \nthe  DOE  validation  or \n\nof \nthe  DOE  or  outsourced  entities  where \nverification/certification functions are performed; \n\n(ii)  On-site assessment at an A6.4 project or A6.4 PoA site regarding which the \n\nDOE performed a validation or verification/certification; \n\n(iii)  Off-site document review; \n\n31 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(b) \n\nSpecific aspects to be focused on during the spot-check, such as: \n\n(i)  Management  personnel  of \n\nvalidation  and \nverification/certification  personnel  in  relation  to  its  competence  to  perform \nvalidation and verification/certification functions; \n\nthe  DOE  and \n\nits \n\n(ii)  Organizational  and  management  structure  of  the  DOE,  in  particular  for \nproviding validation and verification/certification services in an independent \nand impartial manner; \n\n(iii)  Any other area identified as relevant to verify the compliance of the DOE with \n\nArticle 6.4 accreditation requirements. \n\n195.  The  name  of  the  DOE  under  spot-check  shall  be  made  public  in  the  report  of  the \nSupervisory Body meeting at which the Supervisory Body decided to conduct the spot-\ncheck or was informed by the AEP of the initiation of the spot-check. \n\n11.2.  Appointment of the AT and preparation of workplan \n\n196.  The secretariat shall, within five days of the Supervisory Body’s decision to conduct the \nspot-check in accordance with paragraph 186 above, or the initiation of the spot-check by \nthe  AEP  in  accordance  with  paragraph  191  above,  appoint  an  AT  for  the  spot-check, \nselecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts. The AT shall consist of at \nleast two members, including a team leader. The size of the AT may vary depending on \nthe nature of the issue that triggered the spot-check. \n\n197.  The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object, \nin writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of \nconflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. \n\n198. \n\nIf  the  DOE  objects  to  the  selection  of  an  AT  member,  the  secretariat  shall  consider \nmodifying  the  composition  of  the  AT  within  five  days  of  receipt  of  the  objection.  If  the \nsecretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection \nof any AT member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 197 above, the AT shall \nbe deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and replaces an \nAT member, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within the same five days. \nAfter  this,  the  same  steps  in  paragraphs  197  above  and  198  shall  repeat  until  the \ncomposition of the AT is deemed accepted. \n\n199.  Once  the  composition  of  the  AT  is  deemed  accepted,  each  AT  member  shall  sign  a \nconfidentiality  agreement  and  conflict  of  interest  declaration  (form  A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n004). \n\n200.  The secretariat shall, within five days of the Supervisory Body’s decision to conduct the \nspot-check in accordance with paragraph 186 above, or the initiation of the spot-check by \nthe AEP in accordance with paragraph 191 above, prepare a workplan (form A6.4-FORM-\nACCR-007) for the spot-check and submit it to the AEP for comments, based on the scope \ndefined  by  the  Supervisory  Body  or  the  AEP,  as  applicable.  The  AEP  may  provide \ncomments on the workplan within five days of receipt of the workplan. The secretariat shall \nfinalize the workplan within five days of the deadline for commenting by the AEP. \n\n201.  The secretariat shall provide the AT with: \n\n(a) \n\nAll relevant information on the areas to be assessed; \n\n32 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n(b) \n\nThe workplan for the assessment. \n\n202. \n\nIf  the  spot-check  is  to  be  conducted  at  an  Article  6.4  project  activity  or  PoA  site,  the \nsecretariat shall: \n\n(a) \n\nSend a notification to the DOE and respective activity participants before the spot-\ncheck; \n\n(b) \n\nRequest the DOE to coordinate necessary arrangements with activity participants. \n\n11.3.  Assessment by the AT \n\n203.  The  AT  shall  review  the  documentation  provided  by  the  secretariat  and  prepare  an \n\nassessment plan taking into account the scope of the spot-check. \n\n204.  After  the  completion  of  its  assessment,  the  AT  shall  prepare  a  draft  spot-check  report \nusing  the  relevant  accreditation  assessment  form  and  non-conformity  reports,  as \napplicable, and make them available to the DOE for comments within seven days. \n\n205.  The DOE shall have five days to provide comments on the draft spot-check report and the \n\nnon-conformity reports, as applicable. \n\n206.  The AT shall finalize the spot-check report within five days of the deadline for commenting \nby  the  DOE  and  submit  it  to  the  AEP  together  with  the  non-conformity  reports,  as \napplicable. \n\n11.4.  Consideration by the AEP \n\n207.  The AEP shall consider the spot-check reports, the non-conformity reports, as applicable, \nand the comments provided by the DOE, and, based on the criteria contained in Appendix \n3 to this procedure, shall recommend to the Supervisory Body one of the following options: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nConfirm the accreditation of the DOE for all accredited sectoral scopes; \n\nRequest  the  DOE  to  identify  and  implement  corrective  actions  to  address  the \nidentified NCs within a specified time frame. The implemented corrective actions \nshall be verified by the AT through a site visit or an off-site document review, as \nappropriate; \n\nPlace the DOE under observation; \n\nSuspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes; \n\n(e)  Withdraw the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes. \n\n208.  The  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DOE  of  the  recommendation  of  the  AEP.

The  submission  shall \ninclude evidence of the payment of the fee referred to in paragraph 5 of this appendix. \n\nThe  AE/DOE  shall  specify  the  particular  provisions  of  the  “Article  6.4  accreditation \nstandard” and/or this procedure that it considers the adverse recommendation breaches \nand shall provide justification and evidence to support its view. \n\nA fee of USD 2,000 shall be payable by the AE/DOE upon submission of the request. \n\nCompleteness check of the request for independent review \n\nUpon receipt of the request for independent review, the secretariat shall acknowledge the \nreceipt promptly. \n\nThe secretariat shall, within seven days of receipt of the request for independent review, \nundertake a completeness check to confirm that the request for independent review has \nbeen  duly  submitted  and  includes  all  relevant  documents  to  carry  out  a  preliminary \nassessment, including evidence of payment of the fee. The secretariat may request the \nAE/DOE to submit further relevant information. The AE/DOE shall submit such information \nwithin seven days or explain why such information cannot be submitted. If no response is \nreceived  from  the  AE/DOE  within  this  time  frame,  the  secretariat  shall  cease  the \ncompleteness check and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request for independent \nreview. \n\nPreliminary assessment of the request for independent review \n\nThe secretariat, after receipt of the request for independent review or further information \nor explanation if requested in accordance with paragraph 7 of this appendix, shall carry \nout and conclude a preliminary assessment of the request for independent review within \n10 days. \n\n52 of 66 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001 \nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation \nVersion: 01.2 \n\n9. \n\nThe preliminary assessment shall cover as a minimum the following: \n\n(a)  Whether  the  request  for  independent  review  was  submitted  by  the  deadline \n\nreferred to in paragraph 3 of this appendix; \n\n(b)  Whether \n\nthe \n\nrequest \n\nfor \n\nindependent \n\nreview \n\nrelates \n\nto  an  adverse \n\nrecommendation; \n\n(c)  Whether specific provisions of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard” and/or this \n\nprocedure have been identified. \n\nIf the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for independent review does not \nmeet all the conditions referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall \ncease the preliminary assessment and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request \nfor independent review. \n\nIf the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for independent review meets all \nthe conditions referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall inform the \nAEP and the Supervisory Body of the request for independent review. \n\nAssessment of the request for independent review \n\nThe  secretariat  shall,  within  five  days  of  successful  conclusion  of  the  preliminary \nassessment, provide the AEP and the Supervisory Body with the request for independent \nreview and all supporting documentation received from the AE/DOE or prepared by the \nsecretariat. \n\nThe secretariat shall, within the same five days of successful conclusion of the preliminary \nassessment, also prepare a list of five experts, selecting from the Accreditation Roster of \nExperts, the Methodologies Roster of Experts or the Registration and Issuance Team, as \ncandidates for  an  independent  panel  to  conduct  an  independent  review  of  the  adverse \nrecommendation, and send the list to the AE/DOE. \n\nThe AE/DOE may object, in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any \nexpert on the list on the basis of conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest. \n\nIf the AE/DOE objects to the selection of an expert, the secretariat shall, within five days, \nconsider modifying the list of experts. If the secretariat considers the objection unjustified, \nor the AE/DOE does not object to the selection of any expert within the time frame referred \nto in paragraph 14 of this appendix, the list of experts shall be deemed accepted. If the \nsecretariat considers the objection justified and modifies the list of experts, it shall  send \nthe modified list to the AE/DOE within the same five days.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement, at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) for the \nmechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the Article 6.4 \nmechanism).1 In accordance with the RMPs, a proposed or registered Article 6.4 activity \n(A6.4  activity)  as  well  as  monitored  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emission  reductions  or  net \nGHG  removals  achieved  by  an  A6.4  activity  shall  be  independently  assessed  by  a \ndesignated operational entity (DOE) against the requirement set out in the RMPs in order \nfor the activity to be registered or renewed under Article 6.4 mechanism, or for Article 6, \nparagraph 4, emission reductions to be issued.2 \n\nDOEs  play  a  vital  role  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  by  performing  validation  and \nverification/certification  functions,  and  the  impartiality  and  competence  of  DOEs  are \nensured  through  the  application  of  the  “Standard:  Article  6.4  accreditation”  and  the \n“Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”. With the application of the “Procedure: Performance \nmonitoring  of  the  Article  4.6  designated  operational  entities”,  specific  measures \n(e.g. increasing the number of performance assessments, defining the focused areas to \nbe assessed in the central office and/or non-central offices in the forthcoming regular on-\nsite surveillance, and initiating spot-checks) can be initiated based on the results of the \nperformance monitoring of DOEs. \n\n1.2.  Objective \n\n3. \n\nThe  objective  of  the  “Procedure:  Performance  monitoring  of  the  Article  6.4  designated \noperational entities” (herein after referred to as “this procedure”) is to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nSet out the process and requirements to monitor the performance of, and address \nnon-compliance by, DOEs in a systematic manner; \n\nFoster the improvement of the performance of DOEs and provide the Supervisory \nBody  of  the  Article  6.4 mechanism  and  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  Accreditation \nExpert  Panel  (AEP)  with  tools  for  informed  decision-making  on  actions  in  the \naccreditation process; \n\n(c) \n\nFoster system-wide improvements via identification of issues where guidance or \nrequirements lack clarity or are non-existent. \n\n2.  Scope \n\n2.1.  Scope \n\n4. \n\nThis procedure monitors the performance of DOEs through the monitoring, classification \nand rating of instances of non-compliance identified in the requests for registration and \n\n1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. Available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. \n\n2  RMPs, paragraphs 46, 51 and 57. \n\n4 of 44 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\nissuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs); requests for \nrenewal  of  crediting  period  of  A6.4  projects;  requests  for  renewal  of  A6.4  PoA  period; \nrequests  for  inclusion  of  A6.4  component  projects  (CPs)3;  request  for  renewal  of  A6.4 \nCPs;4  and  requests  for  approval  of  post-registration  changes  (PRCs)  of  A6.4  projects, \nA6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track submitted by DOEs.5 It provides \nfor the monitoring, classification and categorization  of instances of non-compliance into \npre-defined  subcategories  and  assigns  weight  to  be  used  for  classifying  and  grading \ninstances  of  non-compliances. It establishes a rating  system for all DOEs’ instances of \nnon-compliance, comparing the indicators with the agreed thresholds and recommending \nappropriate actions to be carried out system-wide. \n\nThis procedure is not intended to provide for comparative ranking of DOEs, but to indicate \nthe level of performance and compliance of individual DOEs with the A6.4 accreditation \nrequirements. Its implementation should be complemented with system-wide analysis and \nimprovement. \n\nThe results of the DOE performance monitoring are communicated in the following ways \nto DOEs, the AEP and the Supervisory Body: \n\n(a) \n\nReporting to DOEs on their performance with the three main objectives: \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nProviding feedback on their performance with relevant information that would \nallow  them  to  conduct  a  root-cause  analysis  of  the  deficiencies  in  their \nvalidation/verification work; \n\nInforming  DOEs  of  their  performance  and  level  of  their  performance \nindicators  so  that  they  are  aware  of  whether  the  thresholds  have  been \nreached or are about to be reached; \n\n(iii) \n\nInforming DOEs of whether any further action has been decided on; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nReporting  to  the  AEP  to  provide  information  for  its  informed  decision-making  in \naccordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”; \n\nReporting to the Supervisory Body as the final decision-making body to provide it \nwith  all  relevant  data  for  its  decision-making  in  accordance  with  the  A6.4 \naccreditation procedure as well as to allow the Supervisory Body to make system-\nwide improvements. \n\n3  In accordance with paragraph 98 of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes \n\nof activities”, the assessment of inclusion of CPs is done on a sample basis. \n\n4  In  accordance  with  the  paragraph  259  of  the  “Procedure:  Article  6.4  activity  cycle  procedure  for \nprogrammes  of  activities”,  the  assessment  of  renewals  of  the  crediting  periods  of  CPs  is  done  on  a \nsample basis. \n\n5  This also includes the verification of the transition of clean development mechanism (CDM) activities to \nthe Article 6.4 mechanism. Therefore, the performance of the CDM DOEs that are allowed to verify and \ncertify the requests for issuance from transitioned activities (as per paragraph 22 of the meeting report \non  the  Supervisory  Body  at  its  eighth  meeting  (https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-\nsb008.pdf)) is required to be monitored in accordance with this procedure. \n\n5 of 44 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\n2.2.  Applicability \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\nThis procedure is applicable to the performance of DOEs during their entire accreditation \nterm,  that  is  from  the  date  of  accreditation  by  the  Supervisory  Body  until  the  expiry  of \naccreditation. The provisions of this procedure are not applicable during a suspension of \naccreditation of DOEs. \n\nThe monitoring of the performance of DOEs is based on the compilation of data through \nthe assessment of the requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and \nA6.4 PoAs; requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal \nof A6.4 PoA period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request for renewal of A6.4 CPs; \nand requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the \nprior-approval track submitted by DOEs.6 \n\n2.3.  Entry into force \n\n9. \n\nVersion 01.0 of this procedure enters into force on 9 October 2024. \n\n3.  Definitions \n\n10. \n\nThe following definitions of terms are used in this document: \n\n(a) \n\nDOE  performance:  how  successfully  a  DOE  carries  out  its  validation  and \nverification functions, as defined in the RMPs for the Article 6.4 mechanism and \nthe Supervisory Body; \n\n(b) \n\nNon-compliance: failure to meet Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements. \n\n4.  Data  compilation  and  classification  of  information  on \n\nperformance \n\n4.1.  Classification and grading of instances of non-compliance \n\n11. \n\nThe monitoring of the performance of a DOE is based on the compilation of data through \nthe assessment and review, as applicable, of the requests for registration and issuance \nfor  both  A6.4  projects  and  A6.4  PoAs;  requests  for  renewal  of  crediting  period  of  A6.4 \nprojects;  requests  for  renewal  of  A6.4  PoA  period;  request  for  inclusion  of  A6.4  CPs; \nrequest for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 \nPoAs  and  A6.4  CPs  under  the  prior-approval  track  submitted  by  the  DOE.7  The \nidentification  of  non-compliances,  if  any,  and  their  classification  into  predetermined \ncategories is as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nIssues related to reporting; \n\nIssues related to failure to follow procedural requirements; \n\nTechnical correctness and accuracy issues with regard to failure to identify non-\ncompliance with Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements; \n\n6  See footnote 5. \n\n7  See footnote 5. \n\n6 of 44 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(d)  Other issues, to analyse system-wide gaps and improve classification. \n\n12. \n\nAppendices 1, 2 and 3 divide the above-identified categories into subcategories for the \nprocesses  of  requests  for  registration  for  both  A6.4  projects  and  PoAs;  requests  for \nrenewal  of  crediting  period  of  A6.4  projects;  requests  for  renewal  of  A6.4  PoA  period; \nrequests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs and request for renewal of A6.4 CPs (see Appendix 1); \nrequests for issuance of both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs (see Appendix 2); requests for \napproval  of  PRCs  to  A6.4  projects,  A6.4  PoAs  and  A6.4  CPs  under  the  prior-approval \ntrack (see Appendix 3).8 This further subcategorization is provided in order to reduce the \nlevel of subjectivity during the identification of instances of non-compliance and to provide \nsufficient  information  to  DOEs  to  allow  them  to  understand  their  performance  and \nappropriately focus their internal improvement efforts. \n\n13. \n\nAppendices 1, 2 and 3 also include a weighting for the various categories based on the \nseverity  and  potential  impact  on  the  credibility  of  the  accreditation  processes.  A  linear \nscale using values between 1 (minimum) and 5 (maximum) is used in order to minimize \nsubjectivity during the rating while still allowing sufficient differentiation between the issues \nbased on the severity. \n\n4.2.  Definition of performance indicators \n\n14. \n\nBased  on  the  classification  and  weights  referred  to  in  paragraphs  11−13  above,  the \nsecretariat shall measure, for each DOE, the performance indicators defined in paragraph \n15 below. \n\n15. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  calculate,  for  each  of  the  requests  submitted  during  a  given \nmonitoring period as defined in paragraph 25 below, the following performance indicators: \n\n(a) \n\nIndicator I1,9 which includes the following two subindicators: \n\n(i) \n\nIndicator I1,CC (rate of incomplete submissions at completeness check (CC)), \ncalculated  as  the  number  of  requests  concluded  as  incomplete  at \ncompleteness  check  divided  by  the  number  of  requests  submitted  which \nhave completed the cycle,10 regardless of the number of issues identified in \neach incomplete submission: \n\na. \n\nIndicator I1,CC = number of requests concluded as incomplete at CC / \nnumber of requests completed; \n\nb. \n\nIndicator I1,CC is to monitor the following types of requests:11 \n\ni.  Requests  for  registration  and  issuance  for  both  A6.4  projects \n\nand A6.4 PoAs; \n\n8  See footnote 5. \n\n9  The indicators I1,CC and I1,SC shall take into account the number of times a particular request is rejected \nat CC or substantive check (SC). Therefore, if the same request is rejected at CC or SC multiple times, \nthe re-submission of the same request shall be counted as a different request. \n\n10  A request completes its cycle once a final decision (approval, rejection or withdrawal) is taken in a given \n\nmonitoring period. \n\n11  See footnote 5. \n\n7 of 44 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\nii.

Actions  to  be  undertaken  based  on  DOE  performance \n\nmonitoring \n\n31. \n\nBased on the outcome of DOE performance monitoring, different actors shall take a set of \nactions as described in the paragraphs that follow. \n\n8.1.  Actions to be undertaken by DOEs \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\nIf  any  of  the  DOE  performance  monitoring  reports  show  that  a  DOE  has  reached  the \nthreshold for the indicators I1,CC and/or I1,SC or is in the yellow zone or red zone of indicators \nI2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC, the DOE shall undertake a root-cause analysis to identify the causes \nof the deficiencies in its system and implement appropriate corrective and/or preventive \nactions to improve its performance. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  corrective  and/or  preventive  actions \nidentified as a result of the root-cause analysis are adequate and address the identified \nissues in a systematic manner.  \n\nIn addition to the measures as per paragraph 33 above and to ensure prompt action and \neffective measures at place, the DOEs shall undertake root cause analysis, corrections, \ncorrective actions and preventative actions in accordance with the requirements specified \nin the “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation”, section 13.6 upon receipt of information of any \nunsuccessful validation or verification and certification submission by the secretariat and \nreview raised by the Supervisory Body. For all such cases, within 45 days upon receipt of \nsuch notification by the secretariat, the DOEs shall submit evidence of all the actions taken \nto  the  secretariat  through  the  dedicated  e-mail  address.  The  AEP  shall  consider  the \nactions reported by the DOE at its next meeting and decide further measures. \n\n13 of 44 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\n8.2.  Actions to be undertaken by the secretariat \n\n35. \n\n36. \n\nThe information contained in the DOE performance monitoring reports shall be used to \nprepare  the  workplan  of  the  regular  surveillance  assessment  or  the  reaccreditation \nassessment, whichever is to be conducted earlier. \n\nIf the DOE performance monitoring reports corresponding to two consecutive monitoring \nperiods show that a DOE has been in the red zone with regard to performance indicators \nI1,CC or  I1SC,  the  workplan  shall  include  an  instruction  to  the  Assessment  Team  (AT)  to \nassess whether the DOE has carried out a root-cause analysis as a result  of the DOE \nperformance monitoring and that the corrective and/or preventive actions identified were \ncorrectly  undertaken  in  the  next  assessment.  The  AT  shall  report  the  result  of  this \nassessment in its assessment report. \n\n37. \n\nIf  the  DOE  performance  monitoring  reports  show  that  a  DOE  is  in  the  yellow  zone  of \nindicator  I2,  the  workplan  shall  include  an  instruction  for  the  AT  to  assess  whether  the \ncorrective  and/or  preventive  actions  identified  were  correctly  undertaken  in  the  next \nassessment. The AT shall report the result of this assessment in its assessment report. \n\n38. \n\nIf the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the red zone for indicator \nI2, the secretariat shall report the cases to the AEP in accordance with paragraph 43 below. \n\n8.3.  Actions to be undertaken by the Article 6.4 Accreditation Expert Panel \n\n39. \n\nBased on the data reported by the secretariat to the AEP, including instances where the \nSupervisory  Body  approved  the  requests  but  issues  pertaining  to  the  submissions \nidentified by the Supervisory Body indicate a decline in the DOE performance in validation \nor verification, the AEP, at its next meeting or the subsequent meeting, shall decide on the \nnumber  and  type  of  performance  assessments;  the  areas  to  be  assessed  during  the \nperformance assessments, regular on-site surveillance assessments and reaccreditation \nassessments; and/or any appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory Body supported \nby proper justification or the applicable provisions specified in the “Procedure: Article 6.4 \naccreditation”. The Supervisory Body shall consider such a recommendation at its next \nmeeting and decide on the course of action. \n\n8.3.1.  Number of performance assessments \n\n40. \n\nIf  the  DOE  performance  monitoring  reports  show  that  a  DOE  is  in  the  yellow  zone  for \nindicator  I2,REG or  I2,ISS  in  three  consecutive  monitoring  periods,  the  AEP  shall  add  one \nadditional performance assessment to the number of planned performance assessments. \nThe nature of this performance assessment shall be defined considering the process that \nreached the threshold, as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIf  the  threshold  is  reached  as  a  result  of  the  registration  process,  a  validation \nperformance assessment shall be conducted; \n\nIf  the  threshold  is  reached  as  a  result  of  the  issuance  process,  a  verification \nperformance assessment shall be conducted. \n\n41. \n\nThese performance assessments, when possible, shall be on the sectoral scopes and/or \nmethodologies where the DOE recurrently fails to perform appropriately according to the \nresults of the DOE performance monitoring reports. \n\n14 of 44 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\n42. \n\nThe  AEP  shall  reduce  one  performance  assessment  from  those  added  performance \nassessments for a DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure” when \nfour consecutive monitoring periods show that the indicator I2,REG or I2,ISS has remained in \nthe green zone. \n\n8.3.2.  Activation of spot-checks \n\n43. \n\nThe AEP shall initiate a spot-check of a DOE if the DOE is in the red zone of indicator I2 \nin the DOE performance monitoring report. \n\n8.4. \n\n44. \n\n45. \n\nActions to be undertaken by the Supervisory Body \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body, based  on  the information  reported by the secretariat, shall take \nnote of the performance of DOEs. \n\nThe Supervisory Body may also, based on the analysis provided by the secretariat, identify \nany measures to improve its regulatory framework. \n\n15 of 44 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\nAppendix 1.

Calculation of the threshold for indicators \n\n1. \n\n1. \n\nCalculation of the threshold for indicator I1 \n\nThe bootstrap method applied to establish the thresholds for indicators I1,CC and I1,SC \ncomprises the following steps: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nObserve k subgroups of size n for a total of n*k=N observations (k refers to the kth \ndesignated operational entity (DOE) and n to the number of submissions for each \nDOE); \n\nDraw a random sample of size n, with replacement, from the pooled sample of N \nobservations. This sample, x*1, x*2,..,x*n, is a bootstrap sample; \n\nCompute the sample mean (\n\n) from the bootstrap sample drawn in step (b); \n\nRepeat steps (b)–(c) M times; \n\n(e) \n\nSort the M bootstrap estimates: \n\n; \n\n(f) \n\nFind the smallest ordered \nthreshold for indicators. \n\n(g) \n\nIt is required that:1 \n\n such that (1- α)*M values are below it, which is the \n\n(i) \n\nThe size of the random samples in each group (i.e. monitoring periods) is \nthe number of submissions in each monitoring period; \n\n(ii)  The value of M is 10,000; \n\n(iii)  The value of α is 0.05; \n\n(iv)  The maximum of  five years of historical data before the end  of the given \n\nmonitoring period are applied. \n\n1  The value of M (10,000) is selected based on the standard recommended by the scientific community \nin order to avoid bias between the real population and the bootstrapping result. The value of α (0.05) is \nthe most-used threshold applied in the scientific literature, and the historical data period is to stabilize \nthe  indicator.  Therefore,  the  effectiveness  of  these  values  in  improving  the  quality  of  validation  and \nverification processes should be analysed during the inception of the implementation of this procedure \nfor a duration of no less than two years. \n\n38 of 44 \n\n*X***12,,...,MXXX*X  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\n2. \n\n2. \n\nCalculation of indicator I2 \n\nIndicator  I2  is  to  calculate  the  risk  priority  number  (RPN)  value,  which  comprises  the \nfollowing steps: \n\n(a)  Weight of frequency for issues of each type raised (Fj): \n\n(i)  Count  the  number  of  issues  of  each  type  identified  and  rank  them  from \n\nlowest to highest; \n\n(ii)  Transform the rank into a 5-scale system; \n\n(iii)  Determine the square root of 5-scale values, which is the value of Fj; \n\n(iv)  Note that: \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nd. \n\nThe  term  “j”  indicates  issues  of  each  type  raised  as  per  the \ncategorization listed in appendices 1 to 3; \n\nIf the number of issues is repeated for two different types, then these \ntwo issues get the minor value on the scale between these two types \nof issues; \n\nThe frequency of issues of each type raised is derived from at least \nfive monitoring periods from the past. If the number of request for \nreview cases is less than 20, the past monitoring periods shall be \nextended further to ensure there are at least 20 request for review \ncases. This historical frequency is used to establish the RPN mean \nvalue; \n\nIf the number of review cases is less than 3 in a given monitoring \nperiod, the value of Fj is defaulted to 1 while calculating the average \nRPN value; \n\n(b)  Weights  of  criticality  for  issues  of  each  type  (Cj):  Respective  weights  for \n\nclassification of issues are defined in appendices 1 to 3; \n\n(c) \n\nRPN calculation: \n\n(i)  Multiply  Fj  by  Cj  with  number  of  issues  raised  (Nj)  to  calculate  the  RPN \n\nvalue for each request for review cases; \n\n(ii)  Calculate the RPN mean value from each request for review RPN values; \n\n(iii)  Note that for the indicator I2, if the number of review cases is 2 for the kth \nDOE in a given monitoring period (i.e. under the category of less than 3), \nthe average RPN values of these 2 cases will be used as the indicator I2 for \nthe kth DOE; \n\n(iv)  Note that for the indicator I2, as referred in the footnotes 13, 15 and 17 in \nmain body of this procedure, where the kth DOE has requests higher than \nor equal to 3, but this DOE is the only DOE having the request cases in a \ngiven monitoring period, the average RPN values of those request cases \nwill be used as the indicator for the kth DOE. \n\n39 of 44 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002 \nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities \nVersion 01.0 \n\n3. \n\n3. \n\nExample  of  the  indicator  I2  by  applying  the  request  for  issuance \nsubmissions \n\nTable 1 below is an example of the application of provisions specified in section 2 above. \nThere  are  30  requests  for  review  raised  in  a  given  monitoring  period.

The  conclusions  of  the \nperformance monitoring are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\nAll  3  requests  for  review  cases  by  DOE  I  have  the  same  RPN  value  (i.e. \n17.18, 17.18 and 17.18), which is above the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.77). \nThe proportion of cases over the RPN mean value (i.e. 1, which is due to all \n3 cases being above the RPN mean value) is higher than 0.8, so the DOE I \nis in the red zone; \n\n(ii)  DOE A has 10 request for review cases and only 1 project (i.e. project no. 2), \nwhose RPN value (i.e. 18.39) is higher than the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.77). \nThe proportion of cases over the RPN mean value (i.e. 0.1,  since there is \nonly 1 case out of 10 that is higher than the RPN mean value) is lower than \n0.6, so DOE A is below the yellow zone; \n\n(b) \n\nThe other 12 DOEs have less than 3 request for review cases, and therefore the \nthreshold is defined as per paragraph 24(b) of this procedure. The conclusions of \nthe performance monitoring are as follows: \n\n(i)  DOE M’s RPN value (i.e. 10) is equal to 10 and therefore it is in the red zone;2 \n\n(ii)  DOE L’s RPN value (i.e. 6) is equal to 6 and therefore it is in the yellow zone; \n\n(iii)  DOE N’s RPN value (i.e. 8) is higher than 6 but lower than 10, and therefore \n\nit is in the yellow zone. \n\nTable 2. \n\nExample of performance monitoring outcome \n\nNo. \nrequest \nfor \nreview \ncases \n\nNo. \ncases \nover \nRPN \nmean \nvalue \n\n1 \n1 \n1 \n\n3 \n1 \n2 \n2 \n\n1 \n0 \n1 \n\n3 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n% cases \nover \nRPN \nmean \nvalue \n\n100% \n0% \n100% \n\n100% \n0% \n0% \n0% \n\nDOE \n\nM \nG \nL \n\nI \nK \nD \nB  \n\nResult (If cases ≥ 3) \n\nResult (If cases < 3) \n\nRed \nzone \n\nYellow \nzone \n\nAvg. \nRPN \n\nRed \nzone \n\nYellow \nzone \n\nNA \nNA \nNA \n\nNA \nNA \nNA \n\nWarning  Warning \nNA \nNA \nNA \n\nNA \nNA \nNA \n\n10 \n5 \n6 \n\nNA \n4 \n6 \n3 \n\nWarning  Warning \nNA \nNA \n\nNA \nWarning \n\nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \n\nNA \nNA \nNA \nNA \n\n2   DOE M has one case (project/programme of activities no. 28) with two raised issues.

The  following  items \nconstitute the eligibility criteria: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nSubmission of a completed P.11 form and a completed application questionnaire \nby the deadline specified in the call for applications; \n\nConfirmation of agreement to all provisions of the ToR; \n\nFulfilment of competence requirements as presented in table 1 above. \n\n17. \n\nAny failure to agree to the ToR and the code of conduct provisions, late submission of a \ncompleted  P.11  form  and/or  application  form,  or  non-fulfilment  of  the  competence \nrequirements shall result in disqualification. \n\n5.2.3.  Screening process \n\n18. \n\n19. \n\nAn  application  form  that  is  only  partially  completed  shall  be  evaluated  based  on  the \ninformation provided. In case of any discrepancies between the information provided in \nthe submitted application form and the P.11 form, the most conservative response shall \nbe regarded as the applicable response. \n\nThe  further  process  for  evaluation  of  applicants  depends  on  whether  an  applicant  is \nexternal (i.e. new) or an existing  panel member who has reapplied. External applicants \nmay be invited to participate in an interview via telephone or internet-based call to assess \ntheir  competencies,  whereas  re-applying  members  shall  be  considered  to  have  fulfilled \nthe  competence  requirements  and  therefore  are  evaluated  based  on  the  extent  of \nfulfilment of their role as appointed members (see section 6 below). \n\n5.2.3.1. \n\nExternal applicants – interviews \n\n20. \n\nThe secretariat shall prepare a list of applicants for interviews (interview list) based on the \ncriteria referred to in paragraph 21 below and in consultation with the relevant panel co-\nchairs  (see  section  5.2.4  below).  The  secretariat  shall  seek  to  ensure  that  applicants \nrepresent  a  fair  regional  balance,  including  at  least  three  applicants  from  each  region, \nwhere possible. \n\n21. \n\nThe criteria for inclusion of external applicants in the interview list are as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nEligibility; \n\nExtent and depth of technical competencies; \n\nRelevance of technical competencies for the panel’s workplan (e.g. special skills); \n\nRegional affiliation; \n\nGender. \n\n6 of 13 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-004 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels \nVersion 03.0 \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\nIn  case  of  applications  for  multiple  panels,  and  in  accordance  with  the  composition \nrequirements of the AEP and MEP as specified in appendix 1 of the ToR, applicants may \nbe interviewed for the multiple panels in one interview. \n\nThe interviews shall be conducted by interview panels consisting of cross-unit secretariat \nstaff with process and technical skills. Each interview shall last no longer than 45 minutes \nper applicant. \n\nThe interview panels shall use a standardized set of interview questions for each panel or \nworking group and record the results of the interviews in the form of numeric values. \n\nApplicants’  competencies  shall  be  evaluated  based  on  the  parameters  listed  in  table  1 \nabove  with  specific  attention  to  oral  and  general  communication  skills  in  English \n(satisfactory/non-satisfactory),  the  type  (technical/academic/political)  of  previous  work, \nspecific  attributes  as  a  member  (value-added)  and  other  issues  (e.g.  multiple \napplications). \n\n26. \n\nFor  applicants  with  similar  skills,  preference  shall  be  given  to  an  applicant  whose \nmembership will contribute to balanced regional representation and/or gender balance. \n\n5.2.3.2. \n\nReapplying members – performance evaluation \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\n30. \n\nReapplying  members’  applications  shall  be  evaluated  based  on  the  performance \nevaluation,  as  referred  to  in  section  6  below,  of  the  extent  of  fulfilment  of  their \nresponsibilities as appointed members. \n\nFor  consideration  in  the  selection  process,  members’  performance  results  shall,  as  a \nminimum, cover two full meetings, and for members of the MEP, the assignment of at least \ntwo cases. If a member has been absent and only participated in one meeting, the matter \nshall  be  forwarded  to  the  Supervisory  Body  to  determine  the  appropriate  modality  for \nhandling it. Special circumstances such as maternity or extended sick leave should not \nnegatively impact the performance evaluation of a member. \n\nThe  results  of  a  reapplying  member’s  performance  evaluation  shall  clearly  indicate  the \nmember’s performance according to above average, average or below average. \n\nThe  performance  evaluation  scores  shall  generally  be  treated  as  indicative.  For  the \nselection  process,  this  implies  that  special  skills  may,  for  example,  result  in  a \nrecommendation for appointment despite a below-average performance evaluation score; \nsimilarly, a well performing member’s set of skills may be considered superfluous in the \ncontext of the annual workplan for the panel or working group and therefore may not result \nin a recommendation for appointment. \n\n5.2.4.  Consultation and approval \n\n31. \n\nThe secretariat shall consult with the co-chairs of the respective panels or working group \nthroughout  the  process  and  seek  agreement  from  them  on  the  following  documents \nrelevant to the selection process: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nFinal performance evaluations of reapplying members; \n\nInterview list of external applicants; \n\n7 of 13 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-004 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels \nVersion 03.0 \n\n(c) \n\nShortlist  of  applicants  recommended \nalternatives to the recommended ones for the Supervisory Body’s consideration. \n\nfor  appointment  and  applicants  as \n\n32. \n\nThe  presentation  of  the  shortlist  for  the  Supervisory  Body’s  consideration  shall  include \ninformation on the consultation processes and clearly indicate whether the agreement was \nreached on the matters referred to in paragraph 31(a), 3131(b) and 31(c) above and, in \nthe  event  that  the  agreement  was  not  reached,  reflect  the  different  views  for  the \nSupervisory Body’s consideration. \n\n33. \n\nThe co-chairs of the respective panel or working group shall be provided with the following \ninformation: \n\n(a) \n\nFull list of applicants, clearly indicating: \n\n(i) \n\nEligible and non-eligible applicants; \n\n(ii)  External applicants invited for interviews; \n\n(iii)  Applicants who are reapplying members; \n\n(iv)  Applicants proposed for inclusion in the longlist referred to in paragraph 35 \n\nbelow; \n\n(v)  Applicants proposed for inclusion in the shortlist referred to in paragraph 36 \n\nbelow; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nPerformance evaluation scores (see section 6 below); \n\nP.11 forms of shortlisted applicants. \n\n34. \n\nThe co-chairs of the respective panel shall also have access to the following information, \nif they so wish: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nInterview reports; \n\nP.11 forms of all applicants. \n\n5.2.5.  Shortlisting \n\n35. \n\nThe secretariat shall prepare a longlist, clearly indicating regional affiliation and gender, \nwhich includes: \n\n(a) \n\nExternal  applicants  whose  interview  results  indicate  that  they  deserve  further \nconsideration; \n\n(b) \n\nAll reapplying members who meet performance benchmarks. \n\n36. \n\nBased  on  the  longlist,  the  secretariat  shall  prepare  a  first  draft  of  a  shortlist  for \nconsideration and input by the co-chairs of the respective panel or working group, clearly \nindicating regional affiliation and key words related to skills and value-added. The shortlist \nshall include: \n\n(a) \n\nFor the AEP \n\n(i) \n\nA total of five applicants recommended for appointment; \n\n(ii)  A maximum of three applicants as alternatives; \n\n8 of 13 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-004 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels \nVersion 03.0 \n\n(b) \n\nFor the MEP: \n\n(i) \n\nA total of 14 applicants recommended for appointment; \n\n(ii)  A maximum of six applicants as alternatives. \n\n37. \n\nThe inclusion of applicants in the shortlist or their exclusion from it shall be based on the \nconsideration of: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nOverall composition of skills required in the context of the annual workplans; \n\nBenefits  of  continuity  in  membership  (i.e.  added  value  of  the  continuity  of  the \nspecific set of skills of reapplying members to the composition of the group) and \nbenefits of access to new skills and experience; \n\n(c) \n\nRegional representation and gender balance. \n\n38. \n\nThe  shortlist  shall  be circulated  to  the  Supervisory  Body  as a  confidential  annex  to  the \nannotations for the next Supervisory Body meeting and presented during the Supervisory \nBody  meeting  by  the  co-chairs,  supported  by  the  secretariat.  The  shortlist  shall  be \naccompanied by the full list of applicants. \n\n5.2.6.  Appointment of membership \n\n39. \n\n40. \n\n41. \n\n42. \n\n43. \n\n44. \n\nThe Supervisory Body shall consider the shortlist and select members for each panel or \nworking  group.  The  selected  and  outgoing  members’  names  shall  be  recorded  in  the \ncorresponding Supervisory Body meeting report. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  notify  each  applicant  of  their  application  status,  prioritizing  the \nnotifications to reapplying members. \n\nSelected  members  shall  inform  the  secretariat  at  the  earliest  possible  time  of  any \nconflicting commitments and shall provide justification for any expected absence, including \npartial absence, at a particular meeting. Proper justifications include: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nHospitalization/sickness or emergencies in the immediate family; \n\nPreviously planned professional commitments that present a time conflict with the \nmeeting. \n\nThe secretariat shall update the public website dedicated to the panels and working groups \nwith the newly appointed members’ names in accordance with the start or end of their term \nof service. \n\nThe  co-chairs  of  a  panel  or  working  group  may  request  specific  outgoing  members  to \nattend the first meeting for incoming members to ensure the continuity of the work of the \npanel/ or working group. Such a request may be made if the outgoing member has been \nassigned work which is placed on the agenda for the next meeting. \n\nDuring  the  transition  period  of  outgoing  and  incoming  members,  newly  appointed \nmembers shall be treated as observers until the first meeting of the panel or working group \nfor the incoming members. Observers may be granted access to the relevant extranet of \nthe panel or working group upon receipt of a signed oath of service. \n\n9 of 13 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-004 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels \nVersion 03.0 \n\n45. \n\nNew  members  shall  be  briefed  by  the  secretariat  on  their  roles  and  responsibilities, \nperformance monitoring criteria, and sources of information, either electronically and/or at \nthe first meeting of the panel or working group that they attend. \n\n46. \n\nNew members shall provide the secretariat with: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nA scanned copy of their passport; \n\nBank details; \n\nSigned oath of service in accordance with the form included in Appendix 2 to the \nToR; \n\nSigned  declaration  on  engagement  with  the  United  Nations  system  as  an \nemployee or consultant; \n\n(e) \n\nCurriculum vitae as per the Supervisory Body’s template. \n\n47.  Members shall be assigned an index number by the secretariat no later than six weeks \n\nbefore their first scheduled meeting. \n\n6.  Evaluation  and  reporting  of  performance  of  members  of \n\npanels and working groups \n\n6.1.  Purposes \n\n48. \n\nThe performance evaluation of the panel members, would be conducted in accordance \nwith the ToR, is used for the following three purposes: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nProvide input to the process for selection of members of panels; \n\nProvide  feedback  from  the  co-chairs  of  panels  to  the  panel  members  on  their \nperformance; \n\n(c) \n\nReport on the performance of the members of panels to the Supervisory Body. \n\n6.2.  Performance evaluation \n\n49.  Members’ performance shall be evaluated based on the fulfilment of their responsibilities \n\nthat are derived directly from the roles specified in the ToR. \n\n50. \n\n51. \n\n52. \n\n53. \n\nThe  criterion  for  fulfilment  of  responsibilities  is  the  active  provision  of  input  to  all  the \nsubcomponents of these roles, and the fulfilment of responsibilities as a member shall be \nevaluated based on their performance. \n\nPerformance  evaluation of members  shall  be  undertaken  for  each  meeting  (physical  or \nelectronic), including its pre- and post-meeting tasks. \n\nThe  results  of  the  performance  evaluation  of  individual  members  shall  be  treated  as \nconfidential. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  ensure  that  the  performance  evaluations  are  undertaken  in  a \nstandardized manner by using standard evaluation forms and a reference sheet included \nin Appendix 1 to this document. \n\n10 of 13 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-004 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels \nVersion 03.0 \n\n54. \n\nThe co-chairs of the respective panel or working group and the secretariat shall evaluate \nthe performance of its individual members. \n\n55.  Members’ performance shall be evaluated in the following two areas of activities: \n\n(a) \n\nInter-meeting  work  (evaluated  for  each  case  to  which  individual  members  have \nbeen assigned); \n\n(b) \n\nIn-meeting activity. \n\n56. \n\n57. \n\n58. \n\nThe performance in inter-meeting work is evaluated as a function of the level of complexity \nof the assigned case, the quality of input, and the timeliness of provision of input. \n\nThe performance in in-meeting activity is evaluated as a function of level of activity and \nthe quality of inputs during the meetings. \n\nThe  results  of  the  performance  evaluations  shall  be  recorded  as  numeric  values  and \ncompiled in a spreadsheet for tracking, analysis and reporting purposes. The results shall \nbe  accompanied  by  information  on  members’  adherence  to  the  code  of  conduct  of  the \nSupervisory Body, including the declaration of no conflict of interest. \n\n6.3.  Performance reporting \n\n59. \n\n60. \n\nThe secretariat shall compile the members’ individual performance evaluation results mid-\nterm, with the aim of supporting the process of providing feedback on the performance to \nthe members. The modality for provision of feedback to individual members shall be at the \nprerogative of the respective co-chairs. \n\nThe aim of such feedback shall be to allow a member to improve their performance. Where \nthe  performance  evaluation  has  identified  a  need  for  improvement,  the  feedback  may \ninclude,  inter  alia,  an  encouragement  to  the  member  to  be  more  proactive  during \ndiscussions,  improve  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  inputs,  ensure  a  higher  level  of \npreparedness for in-meeting discussions, or more actively share his or her expertise with \nthe rest of the panel or working group members. \n\n61.  Where the performance evaluation has identified an unsatisfactory level of performance \nof  a  member  with  no  prospect  of  improvement,  the  provisions  on  suspension  and \nsubsequent termination of membership of the member in the ToR shall apply. \n\n62. \n\n63. \n\n64. \n\nIf the secretariat receives a query from a member in response to the  feedback on their \nperformance,  the  secretariat  shall  process  it  in  consultation  with  the  co-chairs  of  the \nrespective panel or working group. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  report  to  the  Supervisory  Body  on  the  performance  of  the  panel \nmembers by preparing a consolidated performance report. This report shall include data \non the performance of each member. \n\nThe reporting shall be undertaken prior to the launch of the call for the selection of new \npanel and working group members in order to allow the Supervisory Body to consider the \nscope  for  the  launch  of  the  call  for  new  members.  The  report  shall  be  treated  as \nconfidential. \n\n11 of 13 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-004 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels \nVersion 03.0 \n\nAppendix 1.

If the two evaluators submit different conclusions, the \nsecretariat will notify them of the different conclusions. In this case, the evaluators shall \ndiscuss  the  recommendation  further  between  themselves  in  an  effort  to  reach  an \nunanimous conclusion. The evaluators may request the secretariat to send any evidence \nreceived  or  to  seek  further  information  to  demonstrate  that  the  candidate  meets  the \nqualification requirements. \n\nThe  AEP,  at  its  next  meeting,  shall  consider  the  final  conclusion  of  the  evaluators  and \ndecide whether to include the applicant on the ARoE or reject the application. \n\nExperts on the ARoE shall provide to the secretariat evidence related to any updates to \ntheir educational development, training activities undertaken and work experience relevant \nto the specific roles qualified and be subject to regular performance monitoring on their \ncompetence  and  qualification  through  evaluation  process  as  specified  in  section  5.4.1 \nbelow.  \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n5.4.1.

In the latter case, the selected \nexpert shall be qualified as a lead A6.4 assessor and shall have at least two years \nof lead assessor experience. \n\n29. \n\nThe following schedule of performance monitoring is established: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nUpon the completion of the expert’s first participation as a team member; \n\nFor a trainee A6.4 assessor: before being approved as an A 6.4 assessor; \n\nFor an A6.4 assessor or technical expert: one on-site observation every two years; \n\nFor a trainee lead A6.4 assessor: before being approved as a lead A6.4 assessor; \n\nFor  a  lead  A6.4  assessor:  one  on-site  observation  every  three  years  or  at  the \nrequest of the AEP. \n\n30. \n\nThe secretariat shall share the findings from the performance monitoring report with the \nexpert. \n\n31.  Where a performance evaluation identifies a need for improvement, the evaluated expert \nshall submit a proposal on how she/he intends to address all identified issues. The expert \nshall  endeavor  to  implement  the  proposed  measures  and,  upon  completion  of  the \nmeasures, submit to the secretariat relevant evidence. The same evaluator who prepared \nthe performance report  shall re-evaluate the  expert  based on  the evidence provided  or \nthrough  additional  monitoring,  depending  on  the  type  and  significance  of  the  issue(s) \nidentified, as decided by the secretariat. \n\n8 of 16 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-005 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation \nroster of experts \nVersion 01.0 \n\n32.  Where  a  performance  evaluation  identifies  an  unsatisfactory  level  of  performance,  the \nsecretariat shall seek a second opinion, if possible, in the same assessment process or in \nanother  assessment  process  to  confirm  the  evaluation.  If  the  negative  evaluation  is \nconfirmed, the secretariat shall inform the evaluated expert. The expert shall have seven \ndays  or  be  within  the  duration  requested  by  the  AEP,  to  respond  in  writing  describing \nher/his  views  on  the  evaluation,  including  root  cause  analysis  and  proposed  corrective \nactions. The expert shall have 30 days or be within the duration requested by the AEP, to \nsubmit the evidence on the implementation of the proposed corrective actions.  \n\n33. \n\nThe  AEP  shall  consider  the  results  of  the  monitoring  process,  relevant  evidence  and \nresponses, as applicable, and decide on one of the following options: \n\n(a) \n\nMaintain the expert on the same roles qualified on ARoE; \n\n(b)  Withdraw the expert from the ARoE; \n\n(c) \n\nTake any other appropriate actions.7 \n\n34. \n\nIf an expert was not assigned to any accreditation assessment for more than 30 months \nor  had  been  previously  removed  from  the  ARoE,  the  expert  shall  be  subject  to  the \nperformance monitoring on his/her first assignment. \n\n35. \n\nInformation obtained during the performance evaluation and its results shall be treated as \nconfidential. \n\n5.4.2.  Suspension of membership \n\n36. \n\nAn expert may be suspended from a roster for the following reasons: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nShe/he  has  failed  to  deliver  work  of  the  required  level  of  quality  and  within  the \nexpected time frames; or \n\nShe/he has been found to be in breach of the applicable provisions of the code of \nconduct as per section 5.2 above, including, the applicable provisions relating to \nconflict of interest; or \n\n(c) \n\nShe/he has been found to be in breach of the confidentiality requirements. \n\n37. \n\nIf an expert on the ARoE is appointed as a member of the Supervisory Body or the AEP, \nthe secretariat shall place his/her membership on the ARoE “on hold” for the duration of \nhis/her  term  of  service  on  that  body.  On  completion  of  that  membership  term  the \nsecretariat shall reinstate him/her on the ARoE after the corresponding evaluation by the \nAEP evaluators. \n\n38. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  undertake  measures  to  safeguard  the  impartiality  of  the  member \nduring these transitions. \n\n7  The  appropriate  actions  may  include  the  following,  but  are  not  limited  to:  reconduct  the  root  cause \nanalysis;  repropose  corrective  actions;  reimplement  the  proposed  corrective  actions;  or  downgrade \nhis/her ARoE roles.  \n\n9 of 16 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-005 \nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation \nroster of experts \nVersion 01.0 \n\n6.

Completeness and eligibility checks \n\n39. \n\n40. \n\n41. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  undertake  the  completeness  check  within  7  days  to  determine \nwhether  the  submitted  grievance  form  contains  all  required  information  referred  to  in \nparagraph 38 above. If the secretariat finds that the information contained in the grievance \nform  is  incomplete,  it  shall  request  the  grievant,  by  providing  the  reason  for \nincompleteness, to submit a revised form to fill the gap within 21 days. The grievant can \nrequest a one-time extension of the deadline for revising the form  of no longer than 14 \ndays. In this case, if the grievant does not submit a revised form within this timeframe, or \nthe submitted revised form is still found to be incomplete, the grievance shall be deemed \nwithdrawn and the secretariat shall notify the grievant accordingly. \n\nUpon successful conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall establish a \ngrievance panel to review this specific grievance by appointing three experts on the roster \nreferred to in paragraph 16 above, taking into account the specificity of the case and the \nexpertise  of  each  expert,  and  designating  one  of  them  as  the  chair  of  the  panel.  The \nsecretariat shall forward the grievance form and any supporting documentation submitted \nby the grievant to the members of the grievance panel. \n\nThe grievance panel shall determine within seven days of receipt of the grievance from \nthe secretariat whether the grievant is eligible to submit the grievance in accordance with \nparagraph  35  above  and  the  grievance  is  within  the  scope  referred  to  in  paragraph  36 \nabove.

In  this \ncase, the secretariat shall promptly inform the grievant of the rejection accordingly. In order \nto determine the eligibility, the chair of the grievance panel may, through the secretariat, \nrequest the  grievant  and/or  any  other  individual  or  organization  it  deems  necessary  for \nthat purpose to provide additional information. \n\n42.

In addition to being \ntransparent, the regulatory documents must be consistent and legally sound to support \nthe  integrity  of  the  carbon  markets  and  emissions  reductions  under  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism. \n\nThe CMA, at its sixth session, requested the Supervisory Body to engage, in consultation \nwith  interested  stakeholders,  further  independent  scientific  and  technical  expertise  and \nlocal  communities,  and  include  the  knowledge,  sciences  and  practices  of  Indigenous \nPeoples,  as relevant, to support  its  work,  including  through  its  expert  panels,  to  review \nproposals as necessary and receive independent scientific and technical advice. It further \nrequested  the  Supervisory  Body  to  consider  relevant  international  environmental \nagreements  when  carrying  out  its  work,  including  when  implementing  the  “Standard: \nApplication of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”,1 the “Standard: Requirements for \nactivities  involving  removals  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism”2  and  the  “Article  6.4 \nsustainable development tool”. 3 It also requested the Supervisory Body, while ensuring \nongoing continuous improvements to reflect the best available science, to strive to ensure \nregulatory  stability  by  avoiding  frequent  substantive  revisions  to  its  adopted  standards, \ntools and procedures. \n\nAt its tenth meeting, the Supervisory Body requested the secretariat to undertake an initial \nstructured legal and editorial review of the regulations and procedures approved by the \nSupervisory Body to ensure consistency among the regulations, including with regard to \nits Rules of Procedure, and to undertake the first review in 2024 with a view to prepare \nrelevant  proposals  for  consideration  by  the  Supervisory  Body  in  2025.  In  addition,  to \nfacilitate  subsequent  reviews  of  regulations,  the  Supervisory  Body  requested  the \nsecretariat  to  establish  a  periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  its \nregulations  to,  among  others,  ensure  transparency  and  consistency  among  the \nregulations, as well as address any matters brought forward by the Supervisory Body for \nconsideration in this regard.  \n\n2.  Scope, applicability, and entry into force \n\n2.1.  Scope \n\n5. \n\nThe  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  establish  the  periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial \nreview system of the Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents governing the Article 6.4 \n\n1  Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf.  \n\n2  Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf.  \n\n3  Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-TOOL-AC-001.pdf. \n\n3 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-008 \nProcedure:  Periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body’s \nregulatory documents \nVersion  01.0  \n\nmechanism  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  periodic  review  system)  and  set  out  its  key \ncomponents and operational framework. This includes defining the focus of the review, \nestablishing  the frequency and timelines for conducting the reviews, clarifying key roles \nand responsibilities of involved actors, and outlining the related decision-making process.  \n\n2.2.  Applicability \n\n6. \n\nThis  document  shall  be  applicable  for  the  periodic  review  of  all  regulatory  documents \napproved by the Supervisory Body.   \n\n2.3.  Entry into force \n\n7. \n\nThis document enters into force on 16 May 2025. \n\n3.  Definitions \n\n8. \n\nThe following definitions of terms are used in this document: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n“Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed; \n\n“Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action \nis recommended as particularly suitable; \n\n(c) \n\n“May” is used to indicate what is permitted. \n\n4.  Normative references \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\nThis  procedure  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  “Decision  and  documentation \nframework”.4 In line with that framework, the Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of \nthe Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully \naccountable to the CMA. The Supervisory Body has authority over and provides guidance \nto the activities and processes of the Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the \nSupervisory Body shall elaborate upon and be consistent with the CMA decisions.  \n\nRegulatory decisions of the Supervisory Body relate to the adoption of, or revision to the \nArticle  6.4  mechanism  rules  and  requirements  developed  under  its  direction.  These \ndecisions  are  reflected  in  the  adoption  of,  or  revision  to,  standards  (including  policy \nstandards,  methodologies,  and  standardized  baselines),  procedures,  tools  (including \npolicy  and  methodological  tools),  guidelines  and  clarifications  (including  policy  and \nmethodological clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the \nSupervisory Body.5  \n\n11. \n\nDecisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded in the meeting reports of the Supervisory \nBody  and  their  accompanying  annexes.

While \nthis framework includes provisions for document control and revision, it does not specifically establish a \nformal legal and editorial review process. \n\n5   Ibid. \n\n4 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-008 \nProcedure:  Periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body’s \nregulatory documents \nVersion  01.0  \n\nregulatory decisions is published on the Article 6.4 mechanism Supervisory Body section \nof the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website.6 \n\n5.  Periodic review system  \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\nBased on the initial review experience and lessons learned, a periodic review system is \nhereby  established,  to  ensure  transparency  and  consistency  among  the  regulations, \nensure  continued  compliance  with  CMA  guidance,  and  address  any  matters  brought \nforward by the Supervisory Body for consideration in this regard. \n\nTo ensure transparency, the periodic review system shall envisage a formal process for \nconducting the periodic reviews, based on clearly defined criteria for legal and editorial \nassessments, and implemented according to a structured timeline. Stakeholder feedback \nand  comments  provided in accordance  with the “Procedure:  Direct  communication  with \nstakeholders”7 shall be considered, as relevant. In addition, the secretariat shall provide \nthe Supervisory Body regular updates on the progress and status of each review, including \nkey  findings  and  any  proposed  regulatory  amendments.  Final  approved  changes  and \nreview outcomes shall be made available through the UNFCCC website. \n\n14. \n\nPeriodic reviews shall be undertaken by the secretariat once approved by the Supervisory \nBody, and may be triggered by, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nScheduled intervals; \n\nNew  CMA  guidance  that  requires  updates  to  the  Article  6.4  mechanism's \noperations; \n\nIdentification by the Supervisory Body of issues that need to be addressed; \n\nIdentification  of  gaps  or  weaknesses  discovered \nexperience or stakeholder feedback; and \n\nthrough \n\nimplementation \n\nFindings  from  other  review  processes  or  other  relevant  developments  that  may \nnecessitate adjustments to the Article 6.4 mechanism's operations. \n\n5.1.  Objectives  \n\n15. \n\nThe periodic review system aims to achieve the following objectives:   \n\n(a) \n\nEstablish  a  structured  process  for  the  periodic  legal  and  editorial  reviews \nand  the  refinement  of  the  Supervisory  Body's  regulatory  documents.  This \nprocess  aims  to  identify  issues  to  consider  in  relation  to  relevant  international \nenvironmental agreements, relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the \nSupervisory Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”. \n\n(b) \n\nImprove  transparency,  legal  clarity,  and  coherence  across  regulatory \ndocuments to support the smooth operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n6   See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-\n\nbody/rules-and-regulations. The review of individual methodologies, methodological tools, standardized \nbaselines, which are under the purview of the Methodology Expert Panel (MEP), are not within the \nscope of the periodic legal and editorial review. \n\n7  A6.4-PROC-GOV-007 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-007.pdf. \n\n5 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-008 \nProcedure:  Periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body’s \nregulatory documents \nVersion  01.0  \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nAs the mechanism operates within a global climate regime, transparency is crucial \nfor  building  trust  among Parties,  private sector  actors,  and civil  society. Regular \nreviews  will  help  identify  and  correct  inconsistencies  or  ambiguities,  ensuring \ninternal coherence and harmonization with relevant frameworks;  \n\nEnhance readability and clarity of the regulations for both technical and non-\ntechnical  audiences,  ensuring \nregulatory \nrequirements. This will ensure that the legal language used is robust, clear, and \naligned  with  evolving  international  legal  standards  and  practices,  thereby \nimproving accessibility for all stakeholders; \n\ntransparent  communication  of \n\nSupport continuous improvement and adaptability by establishing practices for \nrefining the regulatory framework based on lessons learned, stakeholder feedback, \nregulatory developments, and emerging needs;  \n\nPromote regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to the \nadopted  standards,  tools  and  procedures,  while  ensuring  ongoing  continuous \nimprovements; \n\nAddress  any \nissues  brought  forward  by  the  Supervisory  Body  or \nstakeholders, which require legal or editorial clarification. These include providing \na formalized process to address specific legal or operational issues encountered \nby  the  Supervisory  Body  promptly,  ensuring  the  regulatory  framework  remains \nclear and effective;  \n\nEnable  meaningful  and  broad-based  stakeholder  input.  Incorporate  in \naccordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with stakeholders”, input \nfrom  Parties,  non-Party  stakeholders,  and  technical  experts,  consultations  with \nlocal communities including the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous \nPeoples, as relevant, to support its work. This will foster a transparent, inclusive, \nand  participatory  approach  to regulatory  governance,  and  will  help  enhance the \ncredibility of the Supervisory Body and overall trust in the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n5.2.  Focus of the periodic review \n\n16. \n\nThe periodic review system shall focus on two main aspects: \n\n(a) \n\nLegal assessment: Ensuring the regulatory documents consistency with the Paris \nAgreement, and relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the Supervisory \nBody,  and  the  “Decision  and  documentation  framework”;  as  well  as  legal \ncoherence, consistency and clarity. \n\n(b) \n\nEditorial assessment: Ensuring that the regulatory documents are clear, concise, \nand free from ambiguity or inconsistency in language. \n\n5.2.1.  Legal assessment process \n\n17. \n\nThe legal assessment shall focus on ensuring the regulatory documents are legally sound, \nand coherent. It shall support legal certainty, enforceability, and consistency across the \ndocumentation and shall aim to ensure: \n\n(a) \n\nCompliance with CMA guidance and internal decisions and instruments: \n\n6 of 10 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-008 \nProcedure:  Periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body’s \nregulatory documents \nVersion  01.0  \n\n(i) \n\nVerify that each regulatory document is in line with relevant CMA guidance, \nthe  rules  of  procedure  of  the  Supervisory  Body,  and  the  “Decision  and \ndocumentation framework”. \n\n(b) \n\nAlignment with applicable international law and environmental agreements: \n\n(i)  Check  alignment  of the regulatory  documents  with  international treaties or \n\nagreements, when particularly applicable. \n\n(c) \n\nLegal coherence and consistency: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEnsure that the regulatory documents are coherent with CMA guidance, the \nrules  of  procedure  of  the  Supervisory  Body,  and  the  “Decision  and \nthat  the  procedures  and \ndocumentation  framework”,  while  ensuring \nstandards are clearly distinct; \n\nIdentify interdependencies and linkages, highlighting other documents that \nmay require concurrent or subsequent revisions as a result of a revision that \nis being undertaken; \n\n(iii)  Cross-reference related documents to ensure alignment and consistency; \n\n(iv) \n\nIdentify and recommend the removal of redundant or duplicative provisions \nwhere identified. \n\n(d) \n\nLegal clarity:  \n\n(i)  Check whether the legal provisions are clearly drafted, avoiding unnecessary \n\nlegal jargon; \n\n(ii)  Ensure  consistent  use  of  legal  terms  and  definitions  across  all  regulatory \n\ndocuments. \n\n(e) \n\nCompliance and enforcement provisions: \n\n(i) \n\nIdentify any gaps or missing elements that could undermine the effectiveness \nor enforceability of the regulatory documents. \n\n5.2.2.  Editorial assessment process \n\n18. \n\nThe editorial assessment shall focus on enhancing clarity, coherence, and accessibility for \nall stakeholders, both technical and non-technical audiences. The process shall include: \n\n(a) \n\nClarity and readability: \n\n(i) \n\nEnsure the language used is clear, precise, and accessible to both technical \nand non-technical audiences; \n\n(ii)  Simplify complex provisions where possible, without compromising legal or \n\ntechnical accuracy. \n\n(b) \n\nConsistency of terminology: \n\n(i) \n\nVerify consistent use of key terms and concepts throughout the regulatory \ndocuments; \n\n7 of 10 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-008 \nProcedure:  Periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body’s \nregulatory documents \nVersion  01.0  \n\n(ii)  Cross-check  definitions  to  ensure  they  are  used  correctly  and  align  with \nexisting UNFCCC or Paris Agreement texts, as well as CMA guidance, the \nrules  of  procedure  of  the  Supervisory  Body,  and  the  “Decision  and \ndocumentation framework”. \n\n(c) \n\nStructure and formatting: \n\n(i)  Review  the  structure  of  the  regulatory  documents  to  ensure  they  follow  a \n\nlogical progression and flow; \n\n(ii)  Ensure  proper  use  of  headings,  sections,  and  sub-sections  to  make  the \n\ndocument easily navigable; \n\n(iii)  Verify accuracy and currency of cross-references between sections. \n\n(d) \n\nLanguage harmonization: \n\n(i)  Check  for  consistency  in  style  and  tone  across  the  document,  ensuring \n\nadherence to UNFCCC drafting guidelines or style guides; \n\n(ii)  Ensure that technical language and regulatory instructions are harmonized \n\nto avoid confusion among different stakeholders. \n\n(e) \n\nGrammar and style:  \n\n(i)  Correct  grammatical  errors,  improve  sentence  structure,  and  ensure \n\nadherence to a consistent editorial style guide. \n\n5.3.  Periodic review cycles and timelines  \n\n19. \n\nThe periodic review system shall follow structured cycles, designed to ensure timely and \nefficient updates to the Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents. \n\n20. \n\nThe cycles for conducting the periodic reviews shall be as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nRegular reviews: shall be undertaken on an ongoing basis, as necessary, before \neach Supervisory Body document is adopted or revised, and whenever there is a \nneed to address related urgent issues or regulatory gaps that arise; \n\nRecurring reviews: shall be undertaken to ensure systematic updates reflecting \nevolving  legal  developments,  and  to  maintain  consistency  across  regulatory \ndocuments. These reviews should be typically scheduled every 5 years; however, \nthey  may  be  conducted  at  an  earlier  or  later  time  if,  and  only  when,  significant \ntriggers  arise  such  as  regulatory  changes  or  stakeholder  feedback  identifying \nsubstantial deficiencies across multiple existing documents.  \n\n21. \n\nEach recurring review shall typically follow a 6-12-month timeline, comprising the following \nphases: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nPre-review preparation (1-3 months) – Assembly of the review team, planning of \nthe activities, and where applicable, outreach to stakeholders; \n\nReview and analysis (3-6 months) - Conducting legal and editorial assessments \nof regulatory documents and drafting proposed amendments; \n\n8 of 10 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-GOV-008 \nProcedure:  Periodic  structured  legal  and  editorial  review  system  of  the  Article  6.4  Supervisory  Body’s \nregulatory documents \nVersion  01.0  \n\n(c) \n\nApproval and publication (2-3 months) - Submission of proposed revisions to the \nSupervisory Body for consideration and approval, as relevant, followed by public \ndissemination of the updated documents. \n\n6.  Operational framework \n\n6.1.  Key roles and responsibilities \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\nEach recurring review shall be undertaken once approved by the Supervisory Body and \ncoordinated by the secretariat which shall oversee the overall planning, implementation, \nand reporting of the review process. \n\nThe reviews shall be conducted by a legal and editorial review team composed of legal \nspecialists,  technical  specialists  and  editors,  who  could  be  either  secretariat  staff  or \nexternal  experts,  with  experience  in  international  climate  agreements  and  regulatory \nframeworks. \n\n6.2.  Decision making process \n\n24. \n\nThe decision-making process for the periodic reviews will be as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nCoordination by the secretariat: The secretariat shall serve as the coordinating \nbody for both recurring and regular reviews. For recurring reviews, it shall, subject \nto the approval of the Supervisory Body, determine the documents to be reviewed, \nand establish the relevant review teams; \n\nFormulating proposals: Once the review is completed and revisions are made, \nthe secretariat shall prepare a summary of key findings and proposed changes to \nthe regulatory documents, and specify whether each proposed change is either: \n\n(i) \n\nSubstantive, involving changes to the document’s content; or  \n\n(ii)  Corrective or editorial, entailing (primarily minor changes that do not affect or \n\nalter the core meaning of the document; \n\nSubmission to the Supervisory Body: The proposed changes shall be submitted \nto  the  Supervisory  Body  for  its  consideration  and  approval,  as  relevant,  and  in \naccordance  with  the  “Decision  and  documentation  framework”.

Validity of new, revised and previous versions \n\n98. \n\n99. \n\nAn approved new or revised methodology or methodological tool shall be effective from \nthe date of publication on  the UNFCCC website. From this date, a project or PoA may \napply the new or revised version for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for \nglobal stakeholder consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of \na request for renewal of crediting period, in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 \nmechanism activity cycle.”  \n\nIf the Supervisory Body approves a revised methodology or methodological tool indicating \nthat  it  is  a  major  revision  in  accordance  with  paragraph 76(a)(i)  or  93(a)(i)  above,  the \nversion number of the methodology or methodological tool shall increase by one whole \nnumber  (e.g. from  1.0 to  2.0),  and  the  previous  version  shall  continue  to  be  valid \nfor 240 days from the date that the revised version becomes effective unless the previous \nversion has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a) \nor 81(b) above. In this case, for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global \nstakeholder  consultation,  submission  of  a  request  for  registration,  or  submission  of  a \nrequest  for  renewal  of  crediting  period  in  accordance  with  the  “Procedure:  Article  6.4 \nmechanism activity cycle”: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA project or PoA may still apply the previous version during this 240-day period \nunless  the  previous  version  has  been  put  on  hold  by  the  Supervisory  Body  in \naccordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above; and \n\nA  project  or  PoA  shall  apply  the  revised  version  after  this  240-day  period,  or \nimmediately  after  its  adoption  if  the  previous  version  has  been  put  on  hold  in \naccordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. If a PDD or PoA-DD applying the \nprevious version has already been published for global stakeholder consultation, \nthe  project  participants  or  coordinating/managing  entity  shall  revise  the  PDD  or \nPoA-DD applying the revised version. In this case, the DOE shall not publish the \nrevised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, but submit it when it \nsubmits  a  request  for  registration  unless  otherwise  decided  by  the  Supervisory \nBody when it approves the revised methodology or methodological tool. \n\n100. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body approves a revised methodology or methodological tool indicating \nthat it is a minor revision in accordance with paragraph 76(a)(ii) or 93(a)(ii) above, or if an \neditorial revision to an approved methodology or methodological tool has been made in \naccordance  with  paragraph 96  above,  the  version  number  of  the  methodology  or \nmethodological tool shall increase by one fractional number (e.g. from 1.0 to 1.1), and the \nprevious version shall continue to be valid until the next revision for mandatory use. In this \ncase,  for  the  purpose  of  publication  of  a  PDD  or  PoA-DD  for  global  stakeholder \nconsultation,  submission  of  a  request  for  registration,  or  submission  of  a  request  for \nrenewal  of  crediting  period  in  accordance  with  the  “Procedure:  Article  6.4  mechanism \nactivity cycle”, a project activity or PoA may still apply the previous version or any earlier \nversion until the end of the 240-day period after the next major revision. \n\n101. \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  approves  a  new  or  revised  consolidated  methodology  or \nmethodological  tool,  the  approved  methodology  or  methodological  tool  that  has  been \nconsolidated shall continue to be valid for 240 days from the date when the consolidated \nmethodology or methodological tool becomes effective unless the approved methodology \nor methodological tool that has been consolidated has been put on hold by the Supervisory \nBody in accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above.

If a PDD or PoA-DD applying the \nmethodology or methodological tool that has been consolidated has already been \npublished \nthe  project  participants  or \ncoordinating/managing  entity  shall  revise  the  PDD  or  PoA-DD  applying  the \nconsolidated methodology. In this case, the DOE shall not publish the revised PDD \nor  PoA-DD  for  global  stakeholder  consultation  but  submit  it  when  it  submits  a \nrequest for registration unless otherwise decided by the Supervisory Body when it \napproves the revised methodology or methodological tool. \n\nfor  global  stakeholder  consultation, \n\n102.  For  the  purpose  of  publication  of  a  monitoring  report  and  submission  of  a  request  for \nissuance, a project or PoA shall apply the version of the methodology or methodological \ntool  that  the  project  or  PoA  has  been  registered  with.  If  the  project  participants  or \ncoordinating/managing  entity  wish  to  use  a  later  version  of  the  methodology  or \nmethodological tool for the purpose of monitoring of emission reductions or removals after \nthe registration of the project or PoA, or a DOE, when performing a verification, determines \nthat  permanent  changes  to  the  monitoring  plan  as  described  in  the  registered  PDD  or \nPoA-DD, generic CPA-DD, or the monitoring methodology have occurred or expected to \noccur, the DOE shall submit a request for approval by the Supervisory Body prior to the \nsubmission of the request for issuance in accordance with the relevant provisions of the \n“Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle”. \n\n103.  The revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool or the consolidation of \nmethodologies or  methodological tools  shall not affect registered projects or PoAs until \nthe end of the crediting periods during which the validity of the version of the methodology \nor methodological tool applied to the project or PoA expires. \n\n9.

The secretariat shall publish the schedules of the meetings of the Methodological Expert \nPanel and the deadlines  for the submission of requests for clarification of an  approved \nmethodology or methodological tool to be considered by the Methodological Expert Panel \nat the corresponding meeting. The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to \ninitiate  the  consideration  of  the  requests  submitted  on  time  at  the  meeting,  taking  into \naccount the priorities set by the chair of the Methodological Expert Panel for that meeting. \n\n22 of 28 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-001 \nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools \nVersion 01.1 \n\n105.  The project participants of a planned project or PoA, the coordinating/managing entity of \na planned PoA, a host Party, a DOE or any other stakeholder (hereinafter in section 9.1 \nreferred  to  as  the  enquirer)  may,  taking  into  account  the  appendix  to  this  procedure, \nrequest clarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool, by submitting, \nthrough a specific interface on the UNFCCC website, the duly completed “Form: Approved \nbaseline  and  monitoring  methodology/methodological  tool  clarification  request”  to  the \nsecretariat. \n\n9.1.2.  Completeness check \n\n  The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check of the submission within seven days \n\nof the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 104 above. \n\n107. \n\nIf the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall request the enquirer to \nsubmit  the  missing  or  revised  documents  and/or  information.  In  this  case,  the  enquirer \nshall submit the requested documents and/or information to the secretariat within five days \nof receipt of the request. If the enquirer does not submit the requested documents and/or \ninformation  by  this  deadline,  the  secretariat  shall  conclude  that  the  submission  is \nincomplete and stop further processing of the submission. \n\n  Upon conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall notify the enquirer of the \nconclusion of the completeness check. If the submission is concluded as incomplete in \naccordance with paragraph 107 above, the secretariat shall communicate the underlying \nreason(s)  to  the  enquirer.  In  this  case,  the  enquirer  may  resubmit  the  request  for \nclarification  with  revised  documentation  at  any  time.  Upon  submission,  the  revised \ndocumentation shall be treated as a new submission of a request for clarification under \nthis procedure. \n\n9.1.3.  Initial assessment \n\n109.  Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall conduct an initial \nassessment  of  the  submission  using  the  “Form:  Approved  baseline  and  monitoring \nmethodology/methodological tool clarification request initial assessment”  within 15 days \nof the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 104 above, to determine either \nthat: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIt  does  not  involve  any  regulatory  and/or  technical  ambiguity,  or  involves  only \nsimple  regulatory  and/or  technical  issues,  hence  requires  no  analysis  or  only  a \nsimple analysis to formulate a clarification; or \n\nIt involves complex regulatory and/or technical issues, hence requires a thorough \nanalysis to formulate a clarification. \n\n9.1.4.  Fast track \n\n110. \n\nIf the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 109(a) above, \nthe  secretariat  shall  prepare  a  clarification  using  the  “Form:  Approved  baseline  and \nmonitoring  methodology/methodological  tool  clarification  response”    and  send  it  to  the \nenquirer  within  30 days  of  the  deadline  for  submissions  referred  to  in  paragraph 104 \nabove. \n\n111. \n\nIn preparing the clarification, the secretariat may consult with the Methodological Expert \nPanel.

If no member \nof the Methodological Expert Panel objects to the draft clarification within seven days of \nreceipt  of  the  draft  clarification,  the  clarification  shall  be  deemed  finalized  by  the \nMethodological Expert Panel. If a member of the Methodological Expert Panel objects to \nthe draft clarification, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the \nMethodological Expert Panel and be treated under the regular track from the step referred \nto in paragraph 115 below. At the meeting where the case is placed on the agenda, the \nMethodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to finalize the clarification within one \nmeeting. \n\n112.  The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website, specifying to which \n\nversion(s) of the methodology or methodological tool the clarification applies. \n\n9.1.5.  Regular track \n\n113. \n\n114. \n\nIf the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 109(b) above, \nthe  secretariat  shall  prepare  a  draft  recommendation  of  a  clarification  to  the \nMethodological  Expert  Panel  using  the  “Form:  Approved  baseline  and  monitoring \nmethodology/methodological tool clarification response” . \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, \ndepending on the technical complexity of the issues in question, by selecting a maximum \nof two independent experts from the roster of experts referred to in paragraph 20 above \nto review the submission. If the secretariat does not find suitable and available experts on \nthe roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the roster. \n\n115.  The secretariat shall select one member of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward \nthe draft recommendation to him/her for review. The selected member shall provide input \non the draft recommendation within three days of receipt of it. \n\n116. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the \nMethodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in \nparagraph 20 above. \n\n117.

The  secretariat  shall  maintain  on  the  UNFCCC  website  a  publicly  available  list  of  all \nrequests  for  clarification  that  have  been  concluded  as  complete  in  accordance  with \nparagraphs 106−108 above, indicating the current status in the process. \n\n126.  At any step before the clarification is finalized in accordance with paragraph 110, 111 or \n122(a) above, the secretariat may request the enquirer to provide additional information \nregarding  the  request  for  clarification  within  a  defined  time  frame  to  facilitate  the \nassessment  by  the  secretariat  and/or  the  consideration  by  the  Methodological  Expert \nPanel.  If  such  information  significantly  affects  the  outcome  of  the  consideration,  the \nsecretariat shall make the information publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n9.2.  Top-down process \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body,  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  or  the  secretariat  finds  it \nnecessary to clarify provisions of an approved methodology or methodological tool, the \nprocess to revise the methodology or methodological tool as defined in section 6.2 above \nshall  be  followed.  In  this  case,  the  revised  methodology  or  methodological  tool  shall \nincorporate all relevant clarifications issued prior to the revision.\n\n25 of 28 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-001 \nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools \nVersion 01.1 \n\nAppendix. \n\nPrinciples \nclarification \nmethodological tools \n\nof \n\nfor  revision,  consolidation  and \nand \n\nmethodologies \n\n1. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nBackground \n\nThis  appendix  provides  guiding  principles  for  initiating  a  revision  to  an  approved \nmethodology  or  methodological  tool,  for  initiating  a  consolidation  of  methodologies  in \naccordance with the relevant section of this procedure, and for initiating a (request for) \nclarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool. \n\nPrinciples for revision \n\nA revision is the modification of an approved methodology or methodological tool in order \nto improve it or broaden its scope and applicability. \n\nA revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool may be carried out if one \nor more of the following conditions apply: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nNew or generally accepted scientific evidence indicates that emission reductions \nor removal enhancements will be overestimated or underestimated based on the \nthe  reductions  or \napproved  methodology  or  methodological  tool  or \nenhancements may not be real, measurable and verifiable; \n\nthat \n\nThe  applicability  conditions  require  broadening  to  include  more  potential  project \ntypes or conditions for use;1 \n\nThere  are  identified  inconsistencies,  errors  and/or  ambiguities  in  the  language \nand/or formulae used within or between methodologies or methodological tools; \n\nFurther  simplification  (e.g.  default  values)  is  required  to  improve  the  user-\nfriendliness of the approved methodology or methodological tool; \n\nKey issues clarified through a request for clarification of the approved methodology \nor methodological tool in accordance with section 9 of this procedure are required \nto be incorporated in the approved methodology or methodological tool; \n\nThere are changes  to  a methodological tool to which an approved  methodology \nrefers to and the changes affect the provisions of the methodology. \n\n1  A request for revision is suitable for situations where an approved methodology or methodological tool \nis not applicable to a project or PoA but the project or PoA is broadly similar to the project or PoAs to \nwhich the approved methodology is applicable. Similarity is based on the nature (technology/measure) \nof the project or PoA and the sources of the emissions affected by the project or PoA. For example, an \napproved methodology may not be applicable as the sources of emissions affected by the project are \nthe same as those in the methodology but the technology/measure used in the project is not covered \nunder  the  applicability  conditions;  or  the  procedures  provided  in  the  methodology  for  estimating \nemissions from sources are not applicable because of slight variations in the approach, flow of events \nor structure chosen in the project. \n\n26 of 28 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-001 \nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools \nVersion 01.1 \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\nPrinciples for consolidation \n\nThe aims of consolidating methodologies or methodological tools are to: (a) make a set of \napproved  methodologies  or  methodological  tools  more  concise  and  user-friendly;  and \n(b) avoid  possible  inconsistencies  between  methodologies  or  methodological  tools. \nConsolidation  results  in  the  issuance  of  a  new  or  revised  approved  consolidated \nmethodology or methodological tool. \n\nA  consolidation  of  two  or  more  proposed  new,  proposed  revised  and/or  approved \nmethodologies or methodological tools into a single methodology or methodological tool \nmay be carried out if: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThese  methodologies  or  methodological  tools  are  similar  in  many  of  their  core \ncomponents \ntechnology,  measure,  baseline \ndetermination, demonstration of additionality, emission calculation); and \n\n(e.g. applicability,  approach, \n\nA  new  consolidated  methodology  or  methodological  tool  can  be  drafted  on  the \nbasis of these methodologies or methodological tools, which will be applicable to \nall  the  projects  and  PoAs  that  apply  at  least  one  of  these  methodologies  or \nmethodological tools. \n\nA consolidated methodology or methodological tool may also include elements from other \nproposed new, proposed revised or approved methodologies or methodological tools that \nare not part of the consolidation. \n\nIn  consolidating  methodologies  or  methodological  tools,  a  balance  has  to  be  made \nbetween  reducing  the  number  of  methodologies  or  methodological  tools  available  to \nproject  participants  and  coordinating/managing  entities  in  the  database,  and  the \ncomplexity  of  the  methodologies  and  the  methodological  tools,  in  order  to  keep  the \ndatabase of methodologies and methodological tools lean and concise. \n\nIf a consolidated methodology or methodological tool involves an approved methodology \nor  methodological  tool,  and  the consolidated  one  fully  covers  the  approved  one  having \nbeen consolidated, then the consolidated one supersedes the approved one. \n\nIf the range of applicability conditions of a consolidated methodology or methodological \ntool does not fully cover the combined range of applicability  conditions of the approved \nmethodologies  or  methodological  tools  that  have  been  consolidated,  then  the  original \nmethodologies or methodological tools are not withdrawn, but revised so that their ranges \nof  applicability  conditions  are  limited  to  the  project  types  for  which  the  consolidated \nmethodology is not applicable.

Scope, applicability and entry into force \n\n2.1.  Scope \n\n3. \n\nThe  “Procedure:  Development,  revision,  clarification  and  update  of  standardized \nbaselines”  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  this  procedure)  defines  the  process  for  the \ndevelopment  of  new  standardized  baselines  as  well  as  for  revising,  clarifying,  and \nupdating approved standardized baselines.  \n\n2.2.  Applicability \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nThis procedure applies to standardized baselines that may be applied for  an Article 6.4 \nmechanism project or programme of activities (PoA).  \n\nA standardized baseline may also be developed for a group of Parties. The procedure for \nthe development of standardized baselines for a group of Parties is currently not covered \nin this document; it will be approved by the Supervisory Body in the future. \n\nThis  procedure  does  not  contain  the  process  to  develop  or  revise  a  baseline  and \nmonitoring methodology or methodological tool for the purpose of developing a proposed \nstandardized baseline, or for using the baseline and monitoring methodology together with \na proposed standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions. \n\n2.3.  Entry into force \n\n7. \n\nVersion 01.0 of this procedure enters into force on 31 March 2024. \n\n3.  Normative references \n\n8. \n\nThe  following  referenced  documents  are  indispensable  for  the  application  of  this \nprocedure: \n\n1  See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at: https://unfccc.int/documents/460950. \n\n2  Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb002-a02.pdf. \n\n3 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n“Procedure: Activity cycle procedure for project activities” or “Procedure: Activity \ncycle procedure for programmes of activities”; \n\n“Guideline: Quality assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment \nof standardized baselines”; \n\n“Standard: Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines”; \n\n“Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of  baseline  and  monitoring \nmethodologies and methodological tools”. \n\n4.  Definitions \n\n9. \n\nIn addition to the definitions in the “Glossary: Article 6.4 mechanism terms”, the following \nterms apply in this procedure: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n“Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed; \n\n“Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action \nis recommended as particularly suitable; \n\n“May” is used to indicate what is permitted; \n\n“Proponent”  is  a  Party,  activity  participant,  international  industry  organization  or \nadmitted observer organization. \n\n5.  Development of a standardized baseline \n\n5.1.  Approaches to develop a standardized baseline \n\n10. \n\nA standardized baseline shall be developed using one of the following approaches: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nA methodological approach contained in an approved, proposed new or revised \nbaseline and monitoring methodology; \n\nA methodological approach contained in an approved, proposed new or revised \nmethodological tool; or \n\nThe  approach  in  the  other  relevant  methodological  standards  and  guidelines \nadopted by the Supervisory Body3. \n\n5.2.  Bottom-up process \n\n5.2.1.  Submission of a proposed standardized baseline \n\n11. \n\nIt is the prerogative of the designated national authority (DNA) to propose a standardized \nbaseline. If an activity participant, an international industry organization, or an admitted \nobserver organization wishes to submit a standardized baseline, it shall contact the DNA \nof the Party for which the standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, the proponent \n\n3   The Supervisory Body may develop further guidance on how to develop a standardized baseline based \non other approaches (e.g., a standardized baseline to address leakage or a standardized baseline to \ndetermine the best available technology at a country level.) \n\n4 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\nshall  ensure  that  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  complies 4  with  the  “Standard: \nDetermining  coverage  of  data  and  validity  of  standardized  baselines,”  including  the \nrequirements related to  the data coverage period, data currentness, and the validity5 of \nstandardized baselines. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed standardized \nbaseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs 14‒17 below. \n\nNotwithstanding  the provision in paragraph  10  above, if the proponent wishes to use a \ncombination  of  the  approaches  for  the  development  of  the  proposed  standardized \nbaseline, or deviate from the selected approach due to a specific issue of the sector or \ngeographical area (e.g. country or region),6 the proponent shall provide a justification for \nthe necessity and the appropriateness of such combination or deviation in the submission \nof the proposed standardized baseline. In case of deviation from the approach referred to \nin paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above, the proponent shall also justify why a revision of the \napproved methodology or methodological tool is not necessary. \n\nIf  the  proponent  wishes  to  use  a  new  or  revised  approach  to  be  contained  in  a \nmethodology or methodological tool in accordance with paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above, \nor if there is no approved methodology available to be used together with the proposed \nstandardized baseline to estimate emission reductions, it shall, through the DNA of  the \nParty  for  which  the  standardized  baseline  is  proposed,  request  approval  from  the \nSupervisory Body of a new or revised methodology or methodological tool in accordance \nwith the “Procedure:  Development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring \nmethodologies and methodological tools”, through one of the following processes: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nPropose a new or revised methodology or methodological tool through the bottom-\nup  process. 7  In  this  case,  this  proposal  of  a  new  or  revised  methodology  or \nmethodological  tool  shall  be  referred  to  in  the  submission  of  the  proposed \nstandardized baseline; or \n\nRequest  the  secretariat  to  propose  to  the  Supervisory  Body  the  top-down \ndevelopment of a new methodology or methodological tool or the top-down revision \nof an approved methodology or methodological tool. In this case, this request shall \nbe referred to in the submission of the proposed standardized baseline. \n\n4  Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification, when proposing \n\na new standardized baseline. \n\n5  An alternative length of the validity of a standardized baseline compared to the default validity of three \nyears may be proposed in accordance with the “Standard: Determining coverage of data and validity of \nstandardized baselines”. \n\n6  The following are examples of specific issues of the sector or geographical area: (i) the data available \nfor the development of a proposed standardized baseline have a different vintage than that required by \nthe  approved  approach(es);  (ii)  the  default  values  of  baseline  and  additionality  threshold  per  the \n“Guideline for establishment of sector specific standardized baselines” are not applicable in their sector-\nspecific context and therefore a different value(s) of the threshold is justified. \n\n7  The  proposed  new  or  revised  methodology  or  methodological  tool  for  the  purpose  of  developing  a \nproposed standardized baseline, or the proposed new or revised methodology or methodological tool \nthat will be used together with the proposed standardized baseline, may be submitted to the secretariat \nat  the  same  time  with  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  in  accordance  with  the  “Procedure: \ndevelopment, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological \ntools”. \n\n5 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n14. \n\nThe  DNA  submitting  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  shall  submit  the  following \ndocumentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nThe completed “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission”; \n\nA  spreadsheet8 containing  all  data  used  and  the  calculations  performed  for  the \nestablishment of the standardized baseline; \n\nA  quality  control  report  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline:  Quality \nassurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized \nbaselines”; \n\nAn  assessment  report  prepared  in  accordance  with  paragraphs  15,  16  and  17 \nbelow; \n\nAll  additional  documentation  supporting  the  submission  (e.g.  statistics  and/or, \nstudies etc.), where applicable; \n\n(f) \n\nLetter of approval on the proposed standardized baseline from the DNA. \n\n15. \n\nIn  cases  where  no  data  collection/processing  is  required  to  establish  the  proposed \nstandardized baseline:9 \n\n(a) \n\n(a) \n\nThe documentation referred to in paragraphs 14(b)−14(c) above are not required \nto be submitted; \n\nThe  assessment report, referred to in paragraph  14(d) above, does not need to \ncover  the  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  system  referred  to  in  paragraph \n17(a)  below.  Consequently,  the  assessment  report  only  needs  to  include  an \nassessment of the compliance of the proposed standardized baseline with one of \nthe approaches referred to in 17(b) below. \n\n16. \n\nThe  assessment  report  referred  to  in  paragraph  14(d)  above  may  be  prepared  by  a \ndesignated operational entity (DOE) contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other \nentity  under  the  agreement  with  the  DNA.  Alternatively,  an  assessment  report  may  be \nprepared by a DOE with funding support in accordance with the modalities described in \nappendix 1 of this procedure. \n\n17. \n\nThe assessment report shall include a positive assessment opinion: \n\n(a) \n\nOn  the  compliance  of  the  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  system  with  the \nprovisions  and  data  quality  objectives  of  the  “Guideline:  Quality  assurance  and \nquality control of data in the establishment of standardized baselines”; \n\n(b) \n\nThat the proposed standardized baseline meets the requirements of: \n\n(i)  One of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10 above; \n\n8  In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format. \n\n9  Such  cases  are  standardized  baselines  developed  based  only  on  existence  of  or  lack  of  a \npolicy/regulation. For example, since a standardized baseline for landfill gas destruction developed in \naccordance  with  the  “Standard:  Establishment  of  sector  specific  standardized  baselines”  requires \ninformation  only  on  regulations  on  the  mandatory  destruction  level,  no  data  collection/processing  is \nrequired. \n\n6 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(ii)  A  proposed  combination  of  the  approaches  referred  to  in  paragraph  10 \n\nabove; or \n\n(iii)  One of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10 above with a proposed \n\ndeviation from the approach.10 \n\n18. \n\nNo fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed standardized \nbaseline. \n\n5.2.2.  Initial assessment \n\n19. \n\nThe secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form: \nProposed  standardized  baseline  initial  assessment”  within  21 days  of  receipt  of  the \nsubmission to determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 14, 15 \nand 16; \n\nThe  “Form:  Proposed  standardized  baseline  submission”  has  been  completed, \nincluding the name and contact details of the proponent; \n\nThe  proposed  standardized  baseline  was  derived  from  one  of  the  approaches \nreferred to in paragraph 10 above; \n\nExcept for the cases where an assessment report is not submitted in accordance \nwith  paragraph  16,  the  assessment  report  includes  the  positive  assessment \nopinion in accordance with paragraph 17 above. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  of  the  outcome  of  the  initial \nassessment.  If  the  secretariat  finds  that  the  required  documentation  or  information  is \nincomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA \nshould provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  conclude  the  initial  assessment  within  14 days  of  the  receipt  of \nmissing documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion \nof  the  initial  assessment.  If  the  DNA  does  not  provide  the  missing  documents  or \ninformation within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission \nand ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized baseline to \ncontinue  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume  processing  the  submission  as \nsoon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if the DNA does \nnot provide the missing documents or information within one year of the initial notification, \nthe submission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\nUpon  successful  conclusion  of  the  initial  assessment,  the  secretariat  shall  assign  a \nreference  number  to  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  and  make  the  submitted \ndocumentation  publicly  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  with  the  exception  of \ninformation  declared  confidential  and/or  proprietary  by  the  DNA.  Aggregated  data  and \ninformation used to derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential \nor proprietary. \n\n20. \n\n21. \n\n22. \n\n10  If  the  DOE  assesses  a  proposed standardized baseline  with  a  proposed  deviation  from  an approved \n\napproach(es), the assessment of the proposed deviation is not required. \n\n7 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n5.2.3.  Preparation of a draft recommendation \n\n23.  Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall \n\nprepare a draft recommendation on the proposed standardized baseline using either: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n“Form:  Proposed  standardized  baseline \n\nthe \nThe \nrecommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 24(a) or 24(c) below; or \n\nrecommendation” \n\nfor \n\nThe  “Form:  Proposed  standardized  baseline  submission”  for  the  recommended \ncourse of action referred to in paragraph 24(b) below. \n\n24. \n\nThe secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of \naction: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApprove the proposed standardized baseline; \n\nRequest further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted \ndocumentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or \n\n(c) \n\nNot approve the proposed standardized baseline. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\n27. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, \ndepending  on  the  technical  complexity  of  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  and  the \navailability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts \nfrom  the  Methodologies  Roster  of  Experts.  If  the  secretariat  does  not  find  suitable  and \navailable  experts  on  the  roster,  it  may  use  the  services  of  experts  not  included  on  the \nroster. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  select  two  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel 11  and \nforward its draft recommendation to them. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the \nMethodological  Expert  Panel  may  consult  with  the  relevant  working  group,  which  is \ncomprised of sectoral experts on the roster. For the purpose of this consultation, the roster \nof  methodological  experts  may  be  grouped  into  several  working  groups  (e.g.  working \ngroup for renewable energy, working group for transport, working group for waste). \n\n5.2.4.  Consideration by selected members from the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n28. \n\n29. \n\nThe two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of \nreceipt  of  the  draft  recommendation,  independently  assess  the  proposed  standardized \nbaseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the outcome of their \nassessment. \n\nIf  both  of  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  agree  to  the  draft \nrecommendation to approve or not to approve the proposed standardized baseline, the \nsecretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it \npublicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n11 The names, as well as current and past professional affiliations, of the members of the Methodological \nExpert  Panel  will  be  published  on  the  UNFCCC  website.  Additionally,  the  terms  of  reference  for  the \nsupport  structure  of  the  Supervisory  Body  will  elaborate  on  the  principles  and  rules  that  apply  to  the \nMethodological Expert Panel, including provisions related to the code of conduct and conflict of interest. \nThese terms of reference will be developed by the Supervisory Body. \n\n8 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n30. \n\n31. \n\n32. \n\nIf  both  of  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  agree  to  the  draft \nrecommendation that the proposed standardized baseline requires further input from the \nDNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using the “Form: \nProposed standardized baseline submission”. The DNA should submit the requested input \nwithin 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the “Form: Proposed \nstandardized baseline submission”. If the DNA submits input including new data, the DNA \nshould submit a revised assessment report, as applicable, within the same deadline. If the \nDNA does not provide the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable, \nwithin the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission and ascertain \nfrom the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized baseline continue to be \nconsidered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as soon as it receives \nthe requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable. In any case, if the \nDNA does not provide the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable, \nwithin one year of the initial notification, the submission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\nThe secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat  it  is  still  not  sufficient  to  recommend  that  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  be \napproved  or  not  approved,  the  secretariat  may  initiate  a  direct  communication  with  the \nDNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. \n\nThe secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input \nand direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend \nthat  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  be  either  approved  or  not  approved.  The \nsecretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the two selected members \nof  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  for  their  consideration.  In  this  case,  the  steps  in \nparagraphs 29 above or 33−37 below shall follow. \n\n5.2.5.  Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n35. \n\nIf at least one selected member of the  Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the \ndraft  recommendation  or  requests  that  it  be  considered  by  the  Methodological  Expert \nPanel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert \nPanel.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  consider  the  proposed  standardized \nbaseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is received at least \n14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one. \n\nThe  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  its  consideration  within  two  meetings, \nunless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is \nrequired. In case further input from the  DNA or guidance from the  Supervisory Body is \nsought,  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  its  consideration  at  the  meeting \nimmediately following the receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, \nthe  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  conclude  to  recommend  that  the  proposed \nstandardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The secretariat shall forward \nit as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly available on the \nUNFCCC website. \n\nIf the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the \nsecretariat  shall  notify  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  accordingly.  In  this  case,  the  DNA \nshould submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not \nsubmit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing \nthe  submission  and  ascertain  from  the  DNA  whether  it  wishes  that  the  proposed \nstandardized  baseline  continues  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume \nprocessing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the \n\n9 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nDNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the \nsubmission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\n36. \n\n37. \n\nThe secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed standardized \nbaseline be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication \nwith the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. \n\nThe secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input \nand direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend \nthat  the  proposed  standardized  baseline  be  either  approved  or  not  approved.  The \nsecretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert \nPanel  for  its  final  consideration.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  conclude  to \nrecommend that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. \nThe secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make \nit publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n5.2.6.  Preparation of draft standardized baseline \n\n38. \n\nIf  the  recommendation  is  to  approve  the  proposed  standardized  baseline,  before \nforwarding it to the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraphs 29, 34 or 37 above, \nthe secretariat shall: \n\n(a) \n\nReformat the proposed standardized baseline into the form of draft standardized \nbaseline  (DSB)  and  send  it  to  the  two  selected  Methodological  Expert  Panel \nmembers or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the draft \nrecommendation  last.  Upon  receipt  of  an  agreement  on  the  DSB  from  the  two \nselected  Methodological  Expert  Panel  members,  or  from  the  Methodological \nExpert Panel, as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the DSB to the DNA \nand  the  proponent.  The  DNA  shall  confirm  that  it  is  acceptable  or  request \nmodifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by this \ndeadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be \ndelayed  accordingly.  If  the  DNA  does  not  accept  the  DSB  and/or  requests \nmodification  to  it  in  its  response,  the  secretariat  shall  forward  the  DSB  and  the \nresponse from the DNA to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members, \nor \nthe  draft \nrecommendation last. In this case, taking into account the response from the DNA, \nthe  two  selected  Methodological  Expert  Panel  members  shall  finalize  the  DSB \nwithin seven days of receipt, or the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the \nDSB at its next meeting; \n\nthe  Methodological  Expert  Panel,  whichever  considered \n\nto \n\n(b) \n\nEnsure that the proposed new or revised approach(es) to develop the proposed \nstandardized baseline and/or the proposed new or revised methodology to be used \ntogether with the proposed standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions \nhave been approved by the Supervisory Body, if they have been submitted to the \nsecretariat in accordance with paragraph 13 above; \n\n5.2.7.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n39. \n\nIf  no  member  of  the  Supervisory  Body  objects  to  the  recommendation  received  in \naccordance  with  paragraphs 29,  34  or  37  above  within  28 days  of  receipt  of  the \nrecommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision \nadopted by the Supervisory Body. \n\n10 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n40. \n\n41. \n\nAn objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair \nof the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat \nshall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. \n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days \nprior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the \nnext  Supervisory  Body  meeting;  otherwise  it  shall  be  placed  on  the  agenda  of  the \nSupervisory Body meeting after that one. \n\n42. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the \nfollowing courses of action at the meeting: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nApprove the DSB; \n\nNot approve the DSB; \n\nContinue the consideration of the DSB at the next Supervisory Body meeting; or \n\nRequest  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  to  review  the  recommendation  and \nprovide guidance on the issues for the review. \n\n43. \n\n44. \n\nOnce a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the \nDNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory \nBody,  as  applicable,  and  make  the  decision  and  guidance  publicly  available  on  the \nUNFCCC website. \n\nIf the DSB is not approved, the DNA may at any time resubmit a proposed standardized \nbaseline with revised documentation. Upon submission of the revised documentation, the \nsubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a proposed standardized baseline. \n\n5.3.  Top-down process \n\n5.3.1.  Initiation \n\n45. \n\nThe secretariat may propose to the Supervisory Body that the secretariat develop a DSB \nat any time following the receipt of an expression of interest from the DNA(s) of a Party(ies) \nfor which the DSB will be proposed. The  Supervisory Body shall consider the proposal \nand decide on one of the following courses of action: \n\n(a) \n\nApprove  the  proposed  development  of  the  DSB  including,  if  required  during  the \ncourse of the preparation of the DSB, the top-down development of, revision to, or \ndeviation from: \n\n(i) \n\nAn approach to develop the DSB; and/or \n\n(ii)  A  methodology  to  be  used  together  with  the  DSB  for  the  purpose  of \n\nestimation of emission reductions; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nNot approve the proposed development of the DSB; or \n\nContinue the consideration of the proposed development of the DSB at the next \nSupervisory Body meeting. \n\n46. \n\nThe Supervisory Body may prioritize, as needed, the development or approval of a new \nstandardized baseline, based on factors such as relevance for least developed countries \nand  small  island  developing  States,  host  country  priorities  communicated  to  the \n\n11 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nSupervisory Body, potential for transformative climate action at a global or regional scale, \npotential for programmatic approaches, and participation of small and micro businesses. \n\n5.3.2.

The selected members shall provide \ninput on the draft development plan within five days of receipt. \n\nThe secretariat shall finalize the development plan, taking into account the input from the \nselected members of the Methodological Expert Panel within five days of receipt of the \ninput. \n\nThe secretariat shall prepare the DSB in accordance with the development plan. In doing \nso, the secretariat shall ensure that the DSB complies with the “Standard: Determining \ncoverage  of  data  and  validity  of  standardized  baselines”,  including  the  requirements \nrelated  to  the  data  coverage  period,  data  currentness  and  the  validity  of  standardized \nbaselines. \n\nIn preparing the DSB, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, depending on the \ntechnical  complexity  of  the  DSB  and  the  availability  of  expertise  in  the  secretariat,  by \nselecting a maximum of two external experts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If \nthe secretariat does not find suitable and available experts on the roster, it may use the \nservices of experts not included on the roster. \n\nThe secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward \nthe DSB to them. \n\nIn  preparing  the  DSB,  the  secretariat  and  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological \nExpert  Panel  may  consult  with  the  relevant  working  group  referred  to  in  paragraph  27 \nabove. \n\n5.3.3.  Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n55. \n\nThe two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of \nreceipt  of  the  DSB,  independently  assess  the  DSB  and  inform  the  secretariat  of  their \nrecommendation, indicating one of the following courses of action: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApprove the DSB; \n\nRequest further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted \ndocumentation) from the DNA; or \n\n12 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n56. \n\n57. \n\n58. \n\n59. \n\n(c) \n\nRequest that the DSB be considered by the Methodological Expert Panel. \n\nIf both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the \nDSB  be  approved,  the secretariat shall  forward  it  to  the  Supervisory  Body  and  make  it \npublicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the \nDSB  requires  further  input  from  the  DNA,  the  secretariat  shall  notify  the  DNA(s) \naccordingly. The DNA should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. \nIf the DNA does not provide the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall \nsuspend processing the development and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that \nthe DSB continue to be developed. The secretariat shall resume developing the DSB as \nsoon  as  it  receives  the  requested  input.  In  any  case,  if  the  DNA  does  not  provide  the \nrequested input within one year of the initial notification, the secretariat shall terminate the \ndevelopment of the DSB. \n\nThe secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat  it  is  still  not  sufficient  to  develop  the  DSB,  the  secretariat  may  initiate  a  direct \ncommunication with the DNA via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  revise  the  DSB,  taking  into  account  the  further  input  and  direct \ncommunication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat shall forward the revised DSB \nto the two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration. \nIn this case, the steps in paragraphs 56 above or 60−64 below shall follow. \n\n5.3.4.  Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n60. \n\n61. \n\n62. \n\nIf at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel requests that the DSB \nbe considered by the Methodological Expert Panel, the secretariat shall forward the DSB \nto the Methodological Expert Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the \nDSB  at  its  next  meeting,  provided  it  is  received  at  least  14 days  before  the  meeting; \notherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one. \n\nThe Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the DSB within two meetings, unless it finds \nthat further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is required. In case \nfurther  input  from  the  DNA  or  guidance  from  the  Supervisory  Body  is  sought,  the \nMethodological Expert Panel shall finalize the DSB at the meeting immediately following \nreceipt of such input or guidance. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body \nand make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the \nsecretariat  shall  notify  the  DNA  accordingly.  In  this  case,  the  DNA  should  submit  the \nrequested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not submit the requested \ninput within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend the development of the DSB and \nascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the DSB continue to be developed. The \nsecretariat shall resume developing the DSB as soon as it receives the requested input. \nIn any case, if the DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial \nnotification, the secretariat shall terminate the development of the DSB. \n\n63. \n\nThe secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA(s). If the secretariat \nfinds that the further input is still not sufficient to develop the DSB, the secretariat may \ninitiate  a  direct  communication  with the  DNA(s)  via  e-mail  or  conference  calls  to  clarify \nremaining issues. \n\n13 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n64. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  revise  the  DSB,  taking  into  account  the  further  input  and  direct \ncommunication with the DNA(s), as applicable. The secretariat shall forward the revised \nDSB  to  the  Methodological  Expert Panel  for its  final  consideration.  The  Methodological \nExpert  Panel  shall  finalize  the  DSB.  The  secretariat  shall  forward  it  to  the  Supervisory \nBody and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n5.3.5.  Finalization of a draft standardized baseline \n\n65. \n\nBefore forwarding the DSB to the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraphs 56, 61 \nor  64  above,  the  secretariat  shall  communicate  the  DSB  to  the  DNA.  The  DNA  shall \nconfirm that it is acceptable or request modifications to it within 14 days of receipt. If the \nDNA  does  not  respond  by  this  deadline,  the  forwarding  of  the  DSB  to  the  Supervisory \nBody may be delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the DSB and/or requests \nmodification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the DSB and the response \nfrom  the  DNA  to  the  two  selected  Methodological  Expert  Panel  members,  or  to  the \nMethodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the DSB last. In this case, taking into \naccount the response of the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members \nshall finalize the DSB within seven days of receipt, or the  Methodological Expert Panel \nshall finalize the DSB at its next meeting, as applicable. \n\n5.3.6.

The secretariat \nshall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. \n\nIf a member of the  Supervisory Body objects to approving the DSB more than  14 days \nprior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the \nnext  Supervisory  Body  meeting;  otherwise  it  shall  be  placed  on  the  agenda  of  the \nSupervisory Body meeting after that one. \n\n69. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the \nfollowing courses of action at the meeting: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nApprove the DSB; \n\nNot approve the DSB; \n\nContinue the consideration of the DSB at the next Supervisory Body meeting; or \n\nRequest the Methodological Expert Panel to review the DSB and provide guidance \non the issues for the review. \n\n70. \n\nOnce a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the \nDNA of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory Body, as applicable, \nand make the decision and guidance publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n14 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n6.  Revision of a standardized baseline \n\n6.1.  Bottom-up process \n\n6.1.1.  Submission of proposed revised standardized baseline \n\n71. \n\nA proponent may, taking into account the principles for revisions referred to in appendix to \nthis procedure, propose a revision to an approved standardized baseline through the DNA \nof a Party for which the revised standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, if new or \nadditional data were used to establish the proposed revised standardized baseline, the \nproponent  shall  ensure  that  the  new  or  additional  data  used  in  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized baseline complies12 with the “Standard: Determining coverage of data and \nvalidity of standardized baselines,” including the requirements related to the data coverage \nperiod and data currentness. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed revised \nstandardized baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs 72‒74 below. \n\n72. \n\nThe DNA submitting the proposed revised standardized baseline shall submit the following \ndocumentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the \nUNFCCC website: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”; \n\nThe proposed revised standardized baseline, highlighting the proposed changes \nto the approved standardized baseline; \n\nA  spreadsheet13 containing  all  data  used  and  the  calculations  performed  for  the \nestablishment of the proposed revised standardized baseline; \n\nA  quality  control  report  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline:  Quality \nassurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized \nbaselines”; \n\nAn assessment report on the proposed revised standardized baseline containing \nthe information referred to in paragraph 17 above and prepared in accordance with \nparagraph 73(b) below; \n\nAll  additional  documentation  supporting  the  submission  (e.g.  statistics  and/or, \nstudies etc.), where applicable; \n\n(g) \n\nLetter of approval on the proposed revised standardized baseline from the DNA. \n\n73. \n\nIn cases where no new or additional data were required to establish the proposed revised \nstandardized baseline: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  documentation  referred  to  in  paragraph  72(d)  above  is  not  required  to  be \nsubmitted; \n\nThe  assessment  report  referred  to  in  paragraph  72(e)  above  does  not  need  to \ninclude a positive assessment opinion on the compliance of the quality assurance \nand quality control system referred to in paragraph 17(a) above. Consequently, the \n\n12  Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification when proposing \n\na revision to an approved standardized baseline. \n\n13  In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format. \n\n15 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nassessment report only needs to include a positive assessment opinion that the \nproposed standardized baseline meet the requirements of one of the approaches \nreferred to in paragraph 17(b) above. \n\n74. \n\nThe assessment report referred to in paragraph 72(e) above may be prepared by a DOE \ncontracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other entity under the agreement with \nthe DNA. Alternatively, an  assessment report may be  prepared  by a DOE  with funding \nsupport in accordance with the modalities described in appendix 1 to this procedure. \n\n75. \n\nNo  fee  shall  be  payable  to  the  secretariat  for  the  submission  of  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized baseline. \n\n6.1.2.  Initial assessment \n\n76. \n\nThe secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form: \nApproved  standardized  baseline  revision  request  initial  assessment”  within  21 days  of \nreceipt of the submission to determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 72 and \n73 above; \n\nThe  “Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline  revision  request”,  has  been  duly \ncompleted, including the name and contact details of the proponent; \n\nThe proposed revised standardized baseline was derived from the same approach \nas the one used in the approved standardized baseline that is being proposed for \nrevision; \n\nThe assessment report includes a positive assessment opinion in accordance with \nparagraph 17 above. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  of  the  outcome  of  the  initial \nassessment.  If  the  secretariat  finds  that  the  required  documentation  or  information  is \nincomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA \nshould provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification. \n\nThe  secretariat  shall  conclude  the  initial  assessment  within  14 days  of  receipt  of  the \nmissing documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion \nof  the  initial  assessment.  If  the  DNA  does  not  provide  the  missing  documents  or \ninformation within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission \nand  ascertain  from  the  DNA  whether  it  wishes  that  the  proposed  revised  standardized \nbaseline  continues  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume  processing  the \nsubmission as soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if \nthe DNA does not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the \ninitial notification, the submission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\n77. \n\n78. \n\n79. \n\nUpon  successful  conclusion  of  the  initial  assessment,  the  secretariat  shall  assign  a \nreference  number  to  the  proposed  revision  and  make  the  submitted  documentation \npublicly  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  with  the  exception  of  information  declared \nconfidential  and/or  proprietary  by  the  DNA.

Preparation of a draft recommendation \n\n80.  Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall \nprepare  a  draft  recommendation  on  the  proposed  revised  standardized  baseline  using \neither: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  “Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline  revision  recommendation”  for  the \nrecommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 82(a) or 81(c) below; or \n\n“Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline \n\nThe \nrecommended course of action referred to in paragraph 81(b) below. \n\nrevision \n\nrequest” \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\n81. \n\nThe secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of \naction: \n\n(a) \n\nApprove the proposed revised standardized baseline, indicating that: \n\n(i) \n\nThe revision is a major revision; or \n\n(ii)  The revision is a minor revision; \n\n(b) \n\nRequest further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted \ndocumentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or \n\n(c) \n\nNot approve the proposed revised standardized baseline. \n\n82. \n\n83. \n\n84. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, \ndepending on the technical complexity of the proposed revised standardized baseline and \nthe  availability  of  expertise  in  the  secretariat,  by  selecting  a  maximum  of  two  external \nexperts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable \nand available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the \nroster. \n\nThe secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward \nits draft recommendation to them. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the \nMethodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in \nparagraph 27 above. \n\n6.1.4.  Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n85. \n\n86. \n\nThe two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of \nreceipt  of  the  draft  recommendation,  independently  assess  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized  baseline  and  the  draft  recommendation  and  inform  the  secretariat  of  the \noutcome of their assessment. \n\nIf  both  of  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  agree  to  the  draft \nrecommendation that the proposed revised standardized baseline be approved indicating \nthat  the  revision  is  major, 14  approved  indicating  that  the  revision  is  minor, 15  or  not \napproved, the secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body \nand make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n14  See paragraph 181. \n\n15  See paragraph 184. \n\n17 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n87. \n\n88. \n\n89. \n\nIf  both  of  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  agree  to  the  draft \nrecommendation that the proposed revised standardized baseline requires further input \nfrom the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using \nthe “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”. The DNA should submit the \nrequested input within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the \n“Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline  revision  request  form”.  If  the  DNA  does  not \nprovide the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing \nthe submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised \nstandardized  baseline  continues  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume \nprocessing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the \nDNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the \nsubmission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\nThe secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed revised standardized baseline \nbe approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or not approved, the secretariat \nmay  initiate  a  direct  communication  with  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  via  e-mail  or \nconference calls to clarify remaining issues. \n\nThe secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input \nand direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend \nthat  the  proposed  revised  standardized  baseline  be  either  approved  indicating  that  the \nrevision is major or minor, or not approved. The secretariat shall forward the revised draft \nrecommendation to the two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel for their \nconsideration. In this case, the steps in paragraphs 86 above or 90−93 below shall follow. \n\n6.1.5.  Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n90. \n\n91. \n\n92. \n\nIf at least one selected member of the  Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the \ndraft  recommendation  or  requests  that  it  be  considered  by  the  Methodological  Expert \nPanel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert \nPanel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed revised standardized \nbaseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is received at least \n14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one. \n\nThe  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  its  consideration  within  two meetings, \nunless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is \nrequired. In case further  input from the  DNA or guidance from the  Supervisory Body is \nsought,  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  its  consideration  at  the  meeting \nimmediately following receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, the \nMethodological  Expert  Panel  shall  conclude  to  recommend  that  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized baseline be either approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or \nnot approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory \nBody and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the \nsecretariat  shall  notify  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  accordingly.  In  this  case,  the  DNA \nshould submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not \nsubmit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing \nthe submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised \nstandardized  baseline  continues  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume \nprocessing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the \n\n18 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n93. \n\n94. \n\nDNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the \nsubmission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\nThe secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat  the  further  input  is  still  not  sufficient  to  recommend  that  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized baseline be approved indicating that the revision is major or minor,  or not \napproved,  the  secretariat  may  initiate  a  direct  communication  with  the  DNA  and  the \nproponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. \n\nThe secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input \nand direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend \nthat  the  proposed  revised  standardized  baseline  be  either  approved  indicating  that  the \nrevision is major or minor, or not approved. The secretariat shall forward the revised draft \nrecommendation  to  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  for  its  final  consideration.  The \nMethodological  Expert  Panel  shall  conclude  to  recommend  that  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized baseline be either approved indicating that the revision is major or minor or \nnot approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory \nBody and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n6.1.6.  Preparation of draft revised standardized baseline \n\n95. \n\nIf the draft recommendation is to approve the proposed revised standardized baseline in \naccordance with paragraphs 86, 91 or 94 above, the secretariat shall, before forwarding it \nas  the  recommendation  to  the  Supervisory  Body,  reformat  the  proposed  revised \nstandardized  baseline  and  send  it  to  the  two  selected  Methodological  Expert  Panel \nmembers  or  to  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel,  whichever  considered  it  last.  Upon \nreceipt of an agreement on the reformatted revised standardized baseline from the two \nselected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological Expert Panel, \nas  applicable,  the  secretariat  shall  communicate  the  reformatted  revised  standardized \nbaseline to the DNA  and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or \nrequest modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by \nthis  deadline,  the  forwarding  of  the  recommendation  to  the  Supervisory  Body  may  be \ndelayed  accordingly.  If  the  DNA  does  not  accept  the  reformatted  revised  standardized \nbaseline and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the \nreformatted  revised  standardized  baseline  and  the  response  from  the  DNA  to  the  two \nselected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel, \nwhichever considered the draft recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the \nresponse  from  the  DNA,  the  two  selected  Methodological  Expert  Panel  members  shall \nfinalize the reformatted revised standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the \nMethodological Expert Panel shall finalize the reformatted revised standardized baseline \nat its next meeting, as applicable. \n\n6.1.7.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n96. \n\n97. \n\nIf  no  member  of  the  Supervisory  Body  objects  to  the  recommendation  received  in \naccordance  with  paragraphs 86,  91  or  94  above  within  28 days  of  receipt  of  the \nrecommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision \nadopted by the Supervisory Body. \n\nAn objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair \nof the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat \nshall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. \n\n19 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n98. \n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days \nprior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the \nnext  Supervisory  Body  meeting;  otherwise  it  shall  be  placed  on  the  agenda  of  the \nSupervisory Body meeting after that one. \n\n99. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the \nfollowing courses of action at the meeting: \n\n(a) \n\nApprove the proposed revised standardized baseline, indicating that: \n\n(i) \n\nThe revision is a major revision; or \n\n(ii)  The revision is a minor revision; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nNot approve the proposed revised standardized baseline; \n\nContinue the consideration of the proposed revised standardized baseline at the \nnext Supervisory Body meeting; or \n\nRequest  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  to  review  the  recommendation  and \nprovide guidance on the issues for the review. \n\n100.  Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the \nDNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the  Supervisory \nBody,  as  applicable,  and  make  the  decision  and  guidance  publicly  available  on  the \nUNFCCC website. \n\n101. \n\nIf the proposed revised standardized baseline is not approved, the DNA may at any time \nresubmit  a  proposed  revised  standardized  baseline  with  revised  documentation.  Upon \nsubmission  of  the  revised  documentation,  the  submission  shall  be  treated  as  a  new \nsubmission of a proposed revised standardized baseline. \n\n6.2.  Top-down process \n\n6.2.1.  Initiation \n\n102.  The Supervisory Body may, taking into account the principles for revisions referred to in \nappendix to this procedure, decide to revise an approved  standardized baseline at any \ntime. If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved standardized baseline, the \nSupervisory Body shall also decide to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nPut on hold the approved standardized baseline with immediate effect. In this case, \nDOEs  shall  not  submit,  through  a  dedicated  interface  on  the  UNFCCC  website, \nany project design document (PDD) or programme of activities design document \n(PoA-DD) for global stakeholder consultation, any request for registration or any \nrequest  for  renewal  of  the  crediting  period  of  a  project  or  PoA  applying  the \napproved standardized baseline from the day following the date of publication of \nthe Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the decision; \n\nPut on hold the approved standardized baseline with a grace period of 28 days. In \nthis case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC \nwebsite, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, any request for \nregistration or any request for renewal of the crediting period of a project or PoA \napplying the approved standardized baseline more than 28 days following the date \nof publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the decision; or \n\n20 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(c) \n\nMaintain the current version of the approved standardized baseline until the expiry \nof its validity in accordance with section 9 below. \n\n103.  The Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat may at any time, taking into account \nthe  principles  for  revisions  referred  to  in  appendix  to  this  procedure,  propose  that  the \nSupervisory Body revise an approved standardized baseline. If the Methodological Expert \nPanel or the secretariat considers that the current version of the approved standardized \nbaseline should be put on hold, it shall recommend so to the Supervisory Body. In these \ncases, the Supervisory Body shall consider the proposal and/or the recommendation and \ndecide  whether  to  revise  and/or  to  put  on  hold  the  current  version  of  the  approved \nstandardized baseline in accordance with paragraph 102 above. \n\n6.2.2.  Preparation of a draft revised standardized baseline \n\n104. \n\n105. \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  decides  to  revise  an  approved  standardized  baseline  in \naccordance  with  paragraphs 102  or  103  above,  the  secretariat  shall  communicate  the \ndecision  to  the  DNA  of  the  Party  for  which  a  revised  standardized  baseline  will  be \nproposed and seek its agreement to the initiation of the revision. Following receipt of the \nagreement  with  the  DNA  using  the  “Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline  revision \nagreement”,  the  secretariat  shall  prepare  a  draft  revised  standardized  baseline \nhighlighting the proposed changes to the approved standardized baseline. \n\nIn  preparing  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline,  the  secretariat  may  draw  upon \nexternal  expertise,  depending  on  the  technical  complexity  of  the  revision  and  the \navailability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts \nfrom  the  Methodologies  Roster  of  Experts.  If  the  secretariat  does  not  find  suitable  and \navailable  experts  on  the  roster,  it  may  use  the  services  of  experts  not  included  on  the \nroster. \n\n106.  The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward \n\nthe draft revised standardized baseline to them. \n\n107. \n\nIn  preparing  the  draft  revised  standardized  baselines,  the  secretariat  and  the  selected \nmembers of the Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group \nreferred to in paragraph 27 above. \n\n6.2.3.  Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n108.  The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of \nreceipt of the draft revised standardized baseline, independently assess the draft revised \nstandardized baseline and inform the secretariat of their recommendation indicating one \nof the following courses of action: \n\n(a) \n\nApprove the draft revised standardized baseline, indicating that: \n\n(i) \n\nThe revision is a major revision; or \n\n(ii)  The revision is a minor revision; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nRequest further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted \ndocumentation) from the DNA; or \n\nRequest  that  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline  be  considered  by  the \nMethodological Expert Panel. \n\n21 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n109. \n\n110. \n\nIf both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the \ndraft revised standardized baseline be approved indicating that the revision is either major \nor  minor,  the  secretariat  shall  forward  it  to  the  Supervisory  Body  and  make  it  publicly \navailable on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the \ndraft revised  standardized baseline requires further input from the DNA, the secretariat \nshall  notify  the  DNA  accordingly.  The  DNA  should  submit  the  requested  input  within \n28 days  of  the  notification.  If  the  DNA  does  not  provide  the  requested  input  within  the \ndeadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the development  and ascertain from \nthe  DNA  whether  it  wishes  that  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline  continue  to  be \ndeveloped. The secretariat shall resume development of the draft revised standardized \nbaseline  as  soon  as  it  receives  the  requested  input.  In  any  case,  if  the  DNA  does  not \nprovide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the secretariat shall \nterminate the development of the draft revised standardized baseline. \n\n111.  The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat  it  is  still  not  sufficient  to  develop  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline,  the \nsecretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA via e-mail or conference calls \nto clarify remaining issues. \n\n112.  The secretariat shall revise the  draft revised standardized baseline, taking into account \nthe further input and direct communication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat \nshall forward the revised draft revised standardized baseline to the two selected members \nof  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  for  their  consideration.  In  this  case,  the  steps  in \nparagraphs 109 above or 113−117 below shall follow. \n\n6.2.4.  Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n113. \n\nIf at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel requests that the draft \nrevised  standardized  baseline  be  considered  by  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel,  the \nsecretariat  shall  forward  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline  to  the  Methodological \nExpert  Panel.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  consider  the  draft  revised \nstandardized baseline at its next meeting, provided it is received at least 14 days before \nthe meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the Supervisory Body meeting after that \none. \n\n114.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline \nwithin two meetings, unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the \nSupervisory Body is required. In case  further input from the DNA or guidance from the \nSupervisory  Body  is  sought,  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  the  draft \nrevised standardized baseline at the meeting immediately following receipt of such input \nor guidance. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly \navailable on the UNFCCC website. \n\n115. \n\nIf the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the \nsecretariat  shall  notify  the  DNA  accordingly.  In  this  case,  the  DNA  should  submit  the \nrequested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not submit the requested \ninput  within  the  deadline,  the  secretariat  shall  suspend  the  development  of  the  draft \nrevised standardized baseline and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the draft \nrevised  standardized  baseline  continue  to  be  developed.  The  secretariat  shall  resume \ndevelopment  of  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline  as  soon  as  it  receives  the \nrequested input. In any case, if the DNA does not provide the requested input within one \n\n22 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nyear of the initial notification, the secretariat shall terminate the development of the draft \nrevised standardized baseline. \n\n116.  The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat the further input is still not sufficient to develop the draft revised standardized baseline, \nthe secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA via e-mail or conference \ncalls to clarify remaining issues. \n\n117.  The secretariat shall revise the  draft revised standardized baseline, taking into account \nthe further input and direct communication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat \nshall forward the revised draft revised standardized baseline to the Methodological Expert \nPanel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft \nrevised  standardized  baseline.  The  secretariat  shall  forward  it  to  the  Supervisory  Body \nand make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n6.2.5.  Finalization of draft revised standardized baseline \n\n118.  Before \n\nforwarding \n\nin  accordance  with \nthe  draft  revised  standardized  baseline \nparagraphs 109, 114 or  117 above, the secretariat shall communicate the draft revised \nstandardized baseline to the DNA. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or request \nmodifications to it within 14 days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by this deadline, \nthe forwarding of the draft revised standardized baseline to the Supervisory Body may be \ndelayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the draft revised standardized baseline \nand/or  requests  modification  to  it  in  its  response,  the  secretariat  shall  forward  the  draft \nrevised  standardized  baseline  and  the  response  from  the  DNA  to  the  two  selected \nMethodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever \nconsidered the draft revised standardized baseline last. In this case, taking into account \nthe response of the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall \nfinalize  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline  within  seven  days  of  receipt,  or  the \nMethodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft revised  standardized baseline at its \nnext meeting, as applicable. \n\n6.2.6.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n119. \n\nIf no member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the draft revised standardized \nbaseline received in accordance with paragraphs 109, 114 or 117 above within 28 days of \nreceipt of the draft revised standardized baseline, the draft revised standardized baseline \nshall be deemed to be approved by the Supervisory Body. \n\n120.  An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair \nof the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat \nshall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. \n\n121. \n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the draft revised standardized \nbaseline more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be \nplaced on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed \non the agenda of the Supervisory Body meeting after that one. \n\n122. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the \nfollowing courses of action at the meeting: \n\n(a) \n\nApprove the draft revised standardized baseline, indicating that: \n\n(i) \n\nThe revision is a major revision; or \n\n23 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(ii)  The revision is a minor revision; \n\nNot approve the draft revised standardized baseline; \n\nContinue the consideration of the draft revised standardized baseline at the next \nSupervisory Body meeting; or \n\nRequest the Methodological Expert Panel to review the draft revised standardized \nbaseline and provide guidance on the issues for the review. \n\n123.  Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the \nDNA(s) of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory Body, as applicable, \nand make the decision and guidance publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n6.2.7.  Other \n\n124.  The secretariat may propose an editorial revision to an approved standardized baseline at \nany time. In this case, the secretariat shall submit a draft revised standardized baseline to \nthe Chair of the Supervisory Body for his/her review. If the Chair agrees to the draft revised \nstandardized baseline, the secretariat shall publish the revised standardized baseline on \nthe UNFCCC website. The editorial revision shall be noted in the report of the next meeting \nof the Supervisory Body. \n\n7.  Clarification of a standardized baseline \n\n7.1.  Bottom-up process \n\n7.1.1.  Submission of request for clarification \n\n125.  The activity participants of a planned project or PoA, the coordinating/managing entity of \na planned PoA, a DOE, a DNA or any other stakeholder (hereinafter in section 7.1 referred \nto as the enquirer) may, taking into account the principles for clarifications referred to in \nappendix to this procedure, request clarification of an approved standardized baseline by \nsubmitting the completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline clarification request” to \nthe  secretariat  through  a  specified  e-mail  account  made  available  on  the  UNFCCC \nwebsite. \n\n7.1.2.  Initial assessment \n\n126.  The secretariat shall give notice of the receipt of the request for clarification to the DNA of \na Party to which the approved standardized baseline applies within seven days of receipt. \n\n127.  The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form: \nApproved standardized baseline clarification request initial assessment” within 21 days of \nreceipt of the submission, to determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\nThe  “Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline  clarification  request”,  including  the \nname and contact details of the enquirer, has been duly completed; and \n\n(b) \n\nThe submission is categorized as either: \n\n(i) \n\nInvolving no regulatory and/or technical ambiguity or only simple regulatory \nand/or technical issues, hence requiring no analysis or only a simple analysis \nto formulate a clarification; or \n\n24 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(ii) \n\nInvolving  complex  regulatory  and/or  technical  issues  and/or  having  the \npotential to apply to multiple versions of the approved standardized baseline, \nhence requiring a thorough analysis to formulate a clarification. \n\n128. \n\nIf the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall request the enquirer to \nsubmit  the  missing  or  revised  documents  and/or  information.  In  this  case,  the  enquirer \nshall submit the requested documents and/or information to the secretariat within five days \nof  the  receipt  of  the  request.  If  the  enquirer  does  not  submit  the  requested  documents \nand/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the submission is \nincomplete. \n\n129.  Upon conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall notify the enquirer of the \nconclusion  of  the  initial  assessment.  If  the  submission  is  concluded  as  incomplete  in \naccordance with paragraph 128 above, the secretariat shall communicate the underlying \nreasons to the enquirer. In this case, the enquirer may resubmit the request for clarification \nwith  revised  documentation  at  any  time.  Upon  submission,  the  revised  documentation \nshall be treated as a new submission of a request for clarification under this procedure. \n\n7.1.3.  Fast track \n\n130. \n\n131. \n\nIf the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 127(i) above, \nthe  secretariat  shall  prepare  a  clarification  using  the  “Form:  Approved  standardized \nbaseline clarification response” and send it to the enquirer and the DNA within nine days \nof the successful conclusion of the initial assessment. \n\nIn preparing the clarification, the secretariat may consult with the Methodological Expert \nPanel. In this case, the timeline referred to in paragraph 130 above shall not apply. The \nsecretariat shall send a draft clarification to the Methodological Expert Panel within nine \ndays  of  the  successful  conclusion  of  the  initial  assessment.  If  no  member  of  the \nMethodological Expert Panel objects to the draft clarification within seven days of receipt \nof the draft clarification, the clarification shall be deemed finalized by the Methodological \nExpert  Panel.  If  a  member  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  objects  to  the  draft \nclarification,  the  case  shall  be  placed  on  the  agenda  of  the  next  meeting  of  the \nMethodological Expert Panel. At the meeting where the case is placed on the agenda, the \nMethodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to finalize the clarification within one \nmeeting. \n\n132.  The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website. \n\n7.1.4.  Regular track \n\n133. \n\n134. \n\nIf the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 127(ii) above, \nthe  secretariat  shall  prepare  a  draft  recommendation  of  a  clarification  to  the \nMethodological  Expert  Panel  using \nthe  “Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline \nclarification response”. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, \ndepending  on  the  technical  complexity  of  the  issues  in  question  and  the  availability  of \nexpertise  in  the  secretariat,  by  selecting  a  maximum  of  two  external  experts  from  the \nMethodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does  not find suitable and available \nexperts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the roster. \n\n25 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n135.  The secretariat shall select one member of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward \nthe draft recommendation to him/her for review. The selected member shall provide input \non the draft recommendation within three days of receipt. \n\n136. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the \nMethodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in \nparagraph 27 above. \n\n137.  The secretariat may also forward the draft recommendation to the DNA for review. In this \ncase,  the  DNA  shall  provide  input  on  the  draft  recommendation  within  seven days  of \nreceipt. \n\n138.  The secretariat shall finalize the recommendation, taking into account the input from the \nselected member and the DNA, as applicable, and submit it to the Methodological Expert \nPanel for consideration. \n\n139.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  consider  the  recommendation,  finalize  the \nrecommendation and forward it to the Supervisory Body and publish it in its corresponding \nmeeting report, indicating the version(s) of the approved standardized baseline to which \nthe  clarification  applies.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  make  every  effort  to \nfinalize the recommendation within one meeting. \n\n140. \n\nIf  no  member  of  the  Supervisory  Body  objects  to  the  recommendation  above  within  28 \ndays  of  receipt  of  the  recommendation,  the  recommended  course  of  action  shall  be \ndeemed to be the decision adopted by the Supervisory Body. \n\n141.  An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair \nof the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat \nshall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. \n\n142. \n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days \nprior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the \nnext  Supervisory  Body  meeting;  otherwise  it  shall  be  placed  on  the  agenda  of  the \nSupervisory Body meeting after that one. \n\n143.  At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body \n\nis placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall decide to either: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApprove the recommended clarification; or \n\nRequest  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  to  review  the  recommendation  to  the \nSupervisory Body and provide guidance on the issues for review. \n\n144. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body approves the clarification, the secretariat shall send the finalized \nclarification to the enquirer and the DNA. \n\n145.  The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website. \n\n7.1.5.  Other \n\n146.  At any step before the clarification is finalized in accordance with paragraphs 130, 131 or \n(a)  above,  the  secretariat  may  request  the  enquirer  to  provide  additional  information \nregarding  the  request  for  clarification  within  a  defined  time  frame  to  facilitate  the \nassessment  by  the  secretariat  and/or  the  consideration  by  the  Methodological  Expert \n\n26 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nPanel.  If  such  information  significantly  affects  the  outcome  of  the  consideration,  the \nsecretariat shall make the information publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n7.2.  Top-down process \n\n147. \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body,  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel,  or  the  secretariat  finds  it \nnecessary, taking into account the principles for clarifications referred to in appendix to \nthis procedure, to clarify provisions of an approved standardized baseline, the process to \nrevise the approved standardized baseline as defined in section 6.2 shall be followed. In \nthis  case,  the  draft  revised  standardized  baseline  shall  incorporate  all  relevant \nclarifications issued prior to the revision. \n\n8.  Update of a standardized baseline \n\n8.1.  Bottom-up process \n\n8.1.1.  Submission of a proposed updated standardized baseline \n\n148.  A proponent may propose an updated standardized baseline through the DNA of the Party \nfor which the updated standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, the proponent shall \nensure that the proposed updated standardized baseline complies16 with the “Standard: \nDetermining  coverage  of  data  and  validity  of  standardized  baselines”,  including  the \nrequirements  related  to  the  data  coverage  period,  data  currentness  and  the  validity  of \nstandardized  baselines.  The  DNA  should  subsequently  submit  the  proposed  updated \nstandardized baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs149‒151 below. \n\n149.  The  DNA  submitting  the  proposed  updated  standardized  baseline  shall  submit  the \nfollowing  documentation  to  the  secretariat  through  a  specified  e-mail  account  made \navailable on the UNFCCC website between 270 to 180 days prior to the date when the \nvalidity of the current standardized baseline expires:17 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nThe completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”; \n\nThe proposed updated standardized baseline, highlighting the proposed changes \nto the approved standardized baseline; \n\nA spreadsheet 18 containing all data used and the calculations performed  for the \nestablishment of the proposed updated standardized baseline; \n\nA  quality  control  report  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline:  Quality \nassurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized \nbaselines”; \n\nAn assessment report on the proposed updated standardized baseline containing \nthe information referred to in paragraph 17 above and prepared in accordance with \nparagraph 150 below. \n\n16  Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification when proposing \n\nan update of an approved standardized baseline. \n\n17 Any delay in the submission from  this time frame may create a gap period between the expiry of the \ncurrent  standardized  baseline  and  the  entry-into-force  of  the  updated  standardized  baseline.  For  the \nrequirement for addressing such gap period, see section 9 below. \n\n18  In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format. \n\n27 of 37 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(a) \n\nAll  additional  documentation  supporting  the  submission  (e.g.  statistics  and/or, \nstudies etc.), where applicable; \n\n(b) \n\nLetter of approval on the proposed updated standardized baseline from the DNA. \n\n150. \n\nIn cases where no new or additional data were required to establish the proposed updated \nstandardized baseline: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  documentation  referred  to  in  paragraph  (d)  above  is  not  required  to  be \nsubmitted; \n\nThe  assessment  report  referred  to  in  paragraph  1(e)  above  does  not  need  to \ninclude a positive assessment opinion on the compliance of the quality assurance \nand quality control system referred to in paragraph 17(a) above. Consequently, the \nassessment report only needs to include a positive assessment opinion that the \nproposed standardized baseline meets the requirements of one of the approaches \nreferred to in paragraph 17(b) above. \n\n151.  The assessment report referred to in paragraph 1(e) above may be prepared by a DOE \ncontracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other entity under agreement with the \nDNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be prepared by a DOE with funding support \nin accordance with the modalities described in appendix 1 to this procedure. \n\n152.  The  secretariat  shall  make  every  effort  to  inform  the  DNA  in  advance  of  the  period  for \nrequesting update of the approved standardized baseline. It remains the responsibility of \nthe  DNA  to  ensure  that  all  actions  are  taken  in  accordance  with  this  section  of  the \nprocedure in a timely manner. \n\n153.  The Supervisory Body may, upon request from the DNA, decide to request the secretariat \nto provide technical support to the DNA for the preparation of the request without prejudice \nto the outcome of the subsequent request. \n\n154.  No  fee  shall  be  payable  to  the  secretariat  for  the  submission  of  the  proposed  updated \n\nstandardized baseline. \n\n8.1.2.  Initial assessment \n\n155.  The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form: \nApproved  standardized  baseline  update  request  initial  assessment”  within  21 days  of \nreceipt of the submission. The secretariat shall assess whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 149 and \n150 above; \n\nThe “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”, including the name \nand contact details of the proponent, has been duly completed; \n\nThe  proposed  updated  standardized  baseline  was  derived  from  the  same \napproach  as  the  one  used  in  the  approved  standardized  baseline  that  is  being \nproposed for an update; \n\nThe  proposed  updated  standardized  baseline,  if  developed  using  the  approach \nreferred  to  in  paragraphs  10(a)  or  10(b)  above,  does  not  require  revision  to  the \nunderlying  approved  methodology  or  methodological  tool.  If  it  requires  such \nrevision, the secretariat shall propose that the Board carry out the revision through \n\n28 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nthe top-down process in accordance with the  “Procedure: development, revision \nand  clarification  of  baseline  and  monitoring  methodologies  and  methodological \ntools”; \n\n(e) \n\nThe assessment report includes positive assessment opinion in accordance with \nparagraph 17 above. \n\n156.  The  secretariat  shall  inform  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  of  the  outcome  of  the  initial \nassessment.  If  the  secretariat  finds  that  the  required  documentation  or  information  is \nincomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA \nshould provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification. \n\n157.  The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of receipt of missing \ndocuments or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion of the \ninitial  assessment.  If  the  DNA  does  not  provide  the  missing  documents  or  information \nwithin the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission and ascertain \nfrom  the  DNA  whether  it  wishes  that  the  proposed  updated  standardized  baseline \ncontinues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as \nsoon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if the DNA does \nnot provide the missing documents or information within one year of the initial notification, \nthe submission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\n158.  Upon  successful  conclusion  of  the  initial  assessment,  the  secretariat  shall  assign  a \nreference number to the proposed updated standardized baseline and make the submitted \ndocumentation  publicly  available  on  the  UNFCCC  website  with  the  exception  of \ninformation  declared  confidential  and/or  proprietary  by  the  DNA.  Aggregated  data  and \ninformation used to derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential \nor proprietary. \n\n8.1.3.  Preparation of a draft recommendation \n\n159.  Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall \nprepare a draft recommendation on the proposed updated standardized baseline using \neither: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  “Form:  Approved  standardized  baseline  update  recommendation”  for  the \nrecommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 160(a) or 160(c) below; \nor \n\nThe “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request” for the recommended \ncourse of action referred to in paragraph 160(b) below. \n\n160.  The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of \n\naction: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApprove the proposed updated standardized baseline; \n\nRequest further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted \ndocumentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or \n\n(c) \n\nNot approve the proposed updated standardized baseline. \n\n161. \n\nIn preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, \ndepending  on  the  technical  complexity  of  the  proposed  updated  standardized  baseline \nand the availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external \n\n29 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nexperts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable \nand available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the \nroster. \n\n162.  The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward \n\nits draft recommendation to them. \n\n8.1.4.  Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n163.  The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of \nreceipt  of  the  draft  recommendation,  independently  assess  the  proposed  updated \nstandardized  baseline  and  the  draft  recommendation  and  inform  the  secretariat  of  the \noutcome of their assessment. \n\n164. \n\n165. \n\nIf  both  of  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  agree  to  the  draft \nrecommendation  to  approve  or  not  to  approve  the  proposed  updated  standardized \nbaseline, the secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body \nand make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\nIf  both  of  the  selected  members  of  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  agree  to  the  draft \nrecommendation that the proposed updated standardized baseline requires further input \nfrom the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using \nthe “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”. The DNA should submit the \nrequested input within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the \n“Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”. If the DNA does not provide the \nrequested  input  within  the  deadline,  the  secretariat  shall  suspend  processing  the \nsubmission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized \nbaseline  continue  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume  processing  the \nsubmission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the DNA does not \nprovide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the submission shall \nbe considered withdrawn. \n\n166.  The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed updated standardized baseline \nbe approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the \nDNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues. \n\n167.  The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input \nand direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend \nthat the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The \nsecretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the two selected members \nof  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  for  their  consideration.  In  this  case,  the  steps  in \nparagraphs 164 or 168−172 below shall follow. \n\n8.1.5.  Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel \n\n168. \n\nIf at least one selected member of the  Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the \ndraft  recommendation  or  requests  that  it  be  considered  by  the  Methodological  Expert \nPanel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert \nPanel.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  consider \nthe  proposed  updated \nstandardized  baseline  and  the  draft  recommendation  at  its  next  meeting,  provided  it  is \nreceived  at  least  14 days  before  the  meeting;  otherwise  it  shall  be  considered  at  the \nmeeting after that one. \n\n30 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\n169.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  its  consideration  within  two  meetings, \nunless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is \nrequired. In case further input from the  DNA or guidance from the  Supervisory Body is \nsought,  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  finalize  its  consideration  at  the  meeting \nimmediately following receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, the \nMethodological  Expert  Panel  shall  conclude  to  recommend  that  the  proposed  updated \nstandardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The secretariat shall forward \nit as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly available on the \nUNFCCC website. \n\n170. \n\nIf the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the \nsecretariat  shall  notify  the  DNA  and  the  proponent  accordingly.  In  this  case,  the  DNA \nshould submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not \nsubmit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing \nthe  submission  and  ascertain  from  the  DNA  whether  it  wishes  that  the  proposed \nstandardized  baseline  continues  to  be  considered.  The  secretariat  shall  resume \nprocessing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the \nDNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the \nsubmission shall be considered withdrawn. \n\n171.  The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds \nthat  the  further  input  is  still  not  sufficient  to  recommend  that  the  proposed  updated \nstandardized baseline be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct \ncommunication with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify \nremaining issues. \n\n172.  The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input \nand direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend \nthat the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The \nsecretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert \nPanel  for  its  final  consideration.  The  Methodological  Expert  Panel  shall  conclude  to \nrecommend that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not \napproved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body \nand make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n8.1.6.  Preparation of draft updated standardized baseline \n\n173. \n\nIf the draft recommendation is to approve the proposed updated standardized baseline in \naccordance  with  paragraphs 164,  169  or  172  above,  the  secretariat  shall,  before \nforwarding  it  as  the  recommendation  to  the  Supervisory  Body,  reformat  the  proposed \nupdated  standardized  baseline  and  send  it  to  the  two  selected  Methodological  Expert \nPanel members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered it last. Upon \nreceipt of an agreement on the reformatted updated standardized baseline from the two \nselected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological Expert Panel, \nas  applicable,  the  secretariat  shall  communicate  the  reformatted  updated  standardized \nbaseline to the DNA and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or \nrequest modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by \nthis  deadline,  the  forwarding  of  the  recommendation  to  the  Supervisory  Body  may  be \ndelayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the reformatted updated standardized \nbaseline and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the \nreformatted  updated  standardized  baseline  and  the  response  from  the  DNA  to  the  two \nselected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel, \nwhichever considered the draft recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the \n\n31 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nresponse  from  the  DNA,  the  two  selected  Methodological  Expert  Panel  members  shall \nfinalize the reformatted updated standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the \nMethodological Expert Panel shall finalize the reformatted updated standardized baseline \nat its next meeting, as applicable. \n\n8.1.7.  Consideration by the Supervisory Body \n\n174. \n\nIf  no  member  of  the  Supervisory  Body  objects  to  the  recommendation  received  in \naccordance  with  paragraphs 164,  169  or  172  above  within  28 days  of  receipt  of  the \nrecommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision \nadopted by the Supervisory Body. \n\n175.  An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair \nof the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat \nshall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body. \n\n176. \n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days \nprior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the \nnext  Supervisory  Body  meeting;  otherwise  it  shall  be  placed  on  the  agenda  of  the \nSupervisory Body meeting after that one. \n\n177. \n\nIf the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the \nfollowing courses of action at the meeting: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nApprove the proposed updated standardized baseline; \n\nNot approve the proposed updated standardized baseline; \n\nContinue the consideration of the proposed baseline at the next Supervisory Body \nmeeting; or \n\nRequest  the  Methodological  Expert  Panel  to  review  the  recommendation  and \nprovide guidance on the issues for the review. \n\n178.  Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the \nDNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the  Supervisory \nBody,  as  applicable,  and  make  the  decision  and  guidance  publicly  available  on  the \nUNFCCC website. \n\n179. \n\nIf the proposed updated standardized baseline is not approved, the DNA may at any time \nresubmit  a  proposed  updated  standardized  baseline  with  revised  documentation.  Upon \nsubmission  of  the  revised  documentation,  the  submission  shall  be  treated  as  a  new \nsubmission of a proposed updated standardized baseline. \n\n9.  Validity  of  new,  updated  and  revised  standardized \n\nbaselines \n\n180.  The reference number of an approved new standardized baseline shall indicate the year \nwhen  the  standardized  baseline  comes  into  force. The  approved  new  or  revised \nstandardized baseline shall come into force from the date  as indicated in the approved \nnew  or  revised  standardized  baseline.  From  this  date,  a  project  or  PoA  may  apply  the \napproved new or revised standardized baseline for the purpose of  publishing a PDD or \nPoA-DD  for  global  stakeholder  consultation,  submitting  a  request  for  registration,  or \nsubmitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA period, in accordance with \n\n32 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nthe “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of \nactivities”. The approved new or revised standardized baseline shall be valid for the period \nindicated in the approved new or revised standardized baseline. The validity period of a \nstandardized baseline does not change due to a revision. \n\n181.  The year indicated in the reference number of an approved standardized baseline shall \nbe replaced by the year when an updated standardized baseline comes into force if the \nSupervisory  Body  approves  the  updated  standardized  baseline  in  accordance  with \nparagraph 177(a) above. The version number of the updated standardized baseline shall \nalso be reset to 01.0 (e.g. from 02.1 to 01.0). The updated standardized baseline shall \ncome into force from the date as indicated in the updated standardized baseline for the \npurpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a \nrequest for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA \nperiod,  in  accordance  with  the  “Activity  cycle  procedure  for  projects”  or  “Activity  cycle \nprocedure for programmes of activities”. If, after the publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for \nglobal  stakeholder  consultation,  the  applied  standardized  baseline  has  expired  and  an \nupdated  standardized  baseline  is  available  at  the  time  of  submission  of  a  request  for \nregistration or renewal, the activity participants or the coordinating/managing entity shall \nrevise  the  PDD  or  PoA-DD  applying  the  updated  standardized  baseline.  If,  after  the \npublication  of  the  PDD  or  PoA-DD  for  global  stakeholder  consultation,  the  applied \nstandardized baseline has expired and no valid updated standardized baseline is available \nat the time of submission of a request for registration or renewal, the activity participants \nor  the  coordinating/managing  entity  shall  revise  the  PDD  or  PoA-DD  replacing  the \nstandardized baseline with the corresponding parameter values calculated by themselves \nin  accordance  with  the  applied  methodology  and/or  applicable  methodological  tool.  In \nthese cases, the DOE shall not publish the revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder \nconsultation but shall submit it when it submits a request for registration unless otherwise \ndecided by the  Supervisory Body when it approves the updated standardized baseline. \nThe updated standardized baseline shall be valid for the period indicated in the approved \nupdated standardized baseline. \n\n182. \n\nIf  the  entry  into  force  of  an  updated  standardized  baseline  is  not  immediately  after  the \nexpiry  of  its  previous  version,  thus  creating  a  gap  period  in  the  validity  of  the  two \nconsecutive  versions  of  the  standardized  baseline,  the  activity  participants  and  the \ncoordinating/managing entities shall, for the purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for \nglobal  stakeholder  consultation,  submitting  a  request  for  registration,  or  submitting  a \nrequest for renewal of the crediting period or PoA period, in accordance with the “Activity \ncycle  procedure  for  projects”  or  “Activity  cycle  procedure  for  programmes  of  activities”, \nchoose one of the following options for calculating baseline emissions for such gap period: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDetermine  the  parameter  values  in  accordance  with  the  applied  methodology \nand/or applicable methodological tool; \n\nUse  the  more  conservative  value  between  the  previous  and  the  updated \nstandardized baseline. \n\n183.  The version number of an approved standardized baseline shall increase by one whole \nnumber (e.g. from 01.0 to 02.0) if the Supervisory Body approves a revised standardized \nbaseline indicating that it is a major revision in accordance with paragraphs 99(i) or 122(i) \nabove. In this case, for the purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder \nconsultation, submitting a request for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of \n\n33 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nthe  crediting  period  or  PoA  period  in  accordance  with  the  “Activity  cycle  procedure  for \nprojects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”: \n\n(a) \n\nA project or PoA may still apply the previous version: \n\n(b) \n\n(i)  Until the 240th day from the date when the revised version becomes effective \nunless the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body \nin  accordance  with  paragraphs  104(a)  or  104(b)  above,  if  the  remaining \nvalidity of the standardized baseline for the current period is longer than this \n240-day period; or \n\n(ii)  Until the validity of the standardized baseline for the current period expires \nunless the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body \nin  accordance  with  paragraphs  104(a)  or  104(b)  above,  if  the  remaining \nvalidity of the standardized baseline for the current period is not longer than \nthis 240-day period; and \n\nA  project  or  PoA  shall  apply  the  revised  version  after  this  240-day  period,  or \nimmediately  after  its  adoption  if  the  previous  version  has  been  put  on  hold  in \naccordance with paragraphs 104(a) or 104(b) above, as applicable, for the purpose \nof publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a \nrequest for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period \nor  PoA  period  in  accordance  with  the  “Activity  cycle  procedure  for  projects”  or \n“Activity  cycle  procedure  for  programmes  of  activities”.  If  a  PDD  or  PoA-DD \napplying the previous version has already been published for global stakeholder \nconsultation, the activity participants or coordinating/managing entity shall revise \nthe PDD or PoA-DD, applying the revised version. In this case, the DOE shall not \npublish the revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation but submit \nit  when  it  submits  a  request  for  registration  unless  otherwise  decided  by  the \nSupervisory Body when it approves the revised standardized baseline. \n\n184.  The version number of an approved standardized baseline shall increase by one fractional \nnumber in the first decimal place (e.g. from 01.0 to 01.1) if the Supervisory Body approves \na revised standardized baseline indicating that it is a minor revision in accordance with \nparagraphs 99(ii) or 122(ii) above, or if an editorial revision to an approved standardized \nbaseline has been made in accordance with paragraph 124 above. In this case, for the \npurpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a \nrequest for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA \nperiod  in  accordance  with  the  “Activity  cycle  procedure  for  projects”  or  “Activity  cycle \nprocedure  for  programmes  of  activities”,  a  projector  PoA  may  still  apply  the  previous \nversion or any earlier version of minor revision: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nUntil the 240th day from the date when the next major revision becomes effective \nunless the previous or earlier version(s) has been put on hold by the Supervisory \nBody  in  accordance  with  paragraphs 104(a)  or  104(b)  above,  if  the  remaining \nvalidity  of  the  standardized  baseline  for  the  current  period  after  the  next  major \nrevision is longer than this 240-day period; or \n\nUntil the validity of the standardized baseline for the current period expires unless \nthe previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in accordance \nwith  paragraphs  104(a)  or  104(b)  above,  if  the  remaining  validity  of  the \nstandardized baseline after the next major revision is not longer than this 240-day \nperiod. \n\n34 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nAppendix 1.

The  latter  is  subject  to \navailability of funds. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  shall  determine  the  total  amount  of  funding  available  for  such \nfunding support and the period for which the funding is made available. The Board may \nalso  determine  a  ceiling  on  the  fund  available  for  the  preparation  of  each  assessment \nreport. \n\nThe secretariat or its contractual partner UN organization (e.g., The United Nations Office \nfor  Project  Services)  will  conduct  a  procurement  exercise  with  eligible  and  interested \nDOEs and have a framework contract with the selected DOEs. \n\nThe  DNA  that  wishes  to  receive  support  from  the  secretariat  for  the  preparation  of  the \nassessment  report  may  request  support  by  submitting  a  duly  completed  “Request  for \nfunding for assessment report form” to the secretariat. \n\nWithin 21 days of receipt of the submission from the DNA, the secretariat shall confirm \nwhether the funding is available and whether the submission is complete. \n\nIf  the  secretariat  finds  that  the  submission  is  incomplete,  it  shall  inform  the  DNA \naccordingly  and  request  it  to  submit  any  missing  documents  or  information  to  the \nsecretariat within 10 days. \n\nIf the missing documents or information are not submitted within the deadline referred to \nin paragraph 6 of this appendix, the secretariat shall suspend processing the request for \nfunding until it receives the missing documents or information. \n\nOnce  the  submission  is  considered  complete,  subject  to  availability  of  funds,  the \nsecretariat  or  another  UN  entity  under  agreement  with  the  secretariat  shall  make  a \ncontractual arrangement with the DOE.  \n\n9. \n\nThe DOE shall prepare an assessment report according to the timeline agreed. \n\n10. \n\nOnce  the  standardized  baseline  is  submitted  and  considered  complete,  the  secretariat \nshall make arrangements through its contractual partner to disburse the funds to the DOE. \n\n35 of 37 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-PROC-METH-002 \nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines \nVersion 01.1 \n\nAppendix 2.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) \nfor  the  mechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop \nprovisions  for  the  development  and  approval  of  methodologies,  validation,  registration, \nmonitoring,  verification  and  certification,  issuance,  renewal,  first  transfer  from  the \nmechanism  registry,  voluntary  cancellation  and  other  processes  pursuant  to  chapters \nV.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  fourth  session,  elaborated some  elements  of  the  RMPs relating  to the \noperation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 \n\nThe Supervisory Body, at its ninth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 activity standard for \nprojects” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that sets out the requirements relating \nto the design, implementation and other attributes of Article 6.4 mechanism projects (A6.4 \nprojects). \n\nThe Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the \nrequirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and  assessment  of \nArticle  6.4  mechanism  methodologies”  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  methodologies \nstandard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article \n6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article \n6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two \nstandards  set  out  the  requirements  for  the  development  and  assessment  of  Article  6.4 \nmechanism  methodologies  and  the  requirements  for  activities  involving  removals  and \nemission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas \nthe A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have \nmet the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental \nrisks,  as  well  as  for  assessing  and  enhancing  the  contributions  of  A6.4  activities  to \nsustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of \nthe host Party and the sustainable development  goals (SDGs). \n\n5. \n\nThe Supervisory Body, at its fifteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Demonstration of \nadditionality  for  mechanism  methodologies”  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  additionality \nstandard)  that  sets  out  the  requirements  for  mechanism  methodologies  with  regard  to \ndemonstrating additionality. \n\n1.2.  Objectives \n\n6. \n\nThe  objective  of  this  standard  is  to  set  out  requirements  relating  to  the  design, \nimplementation and other attributes of A6.4 projects. \n\n1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex A available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. \n\n2  Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a). \n\n3  Decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapters III‒VI.

Where  data  are  continuously \nmeasured,  they  shall  be  presented  using  an  appropriate  time  interval.  For  any \ndefault value that is not fixed at the time of registration of the A6.4 project, the most \nrecent value shall be applied; \n\nDescribe  the  equipment  used  to  monitor  each  parameter,  including  details  on \naccuracy  class  and  calibration  information  (frequency,  date  of  calibration  and \nvalidity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan; \n\nDescribe how the parameter is measured/calculated  including the measurement \nand recording frequency; \n\nProvide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g., logbooks, daily records, surveys); \n\nProvide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant; \n\nDescribe  the  QA/QC  procedures  applied,  if  applicable,  as  per  the  registered \nmonitoring plan; \n\nProvide information on appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values and any \nother relevant reference values. \n\n133. \n\nIf  monitored  data  and  parameters  are  determined  through  a  sampling  approach,  the \nactivity participants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance \nwith the sampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan. \n\n134.  For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing \na choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating \nbaseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-ante determination, \nor that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring a determination of these \nvalues ex-ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of the \nsubmission of the request for registration for this purpose, the activity participants shall \napply the same version of the standardized baseline monitoring until the end of the first \ncrediting period. \n\n31 of 39 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-002 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n135.  For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing \na choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating \nbaseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-post determination \nwhere there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of registration, the \nactivity participants may switch to the ex-ante determination, at any time during the first \ncrediting period, by applying an applicable standardized baseline that becomes available \nafter the registration and is valid at the time of the switch, and apply the same version of \nthe  standardized  baseline  for  the  purpose  of  monitoring  for  the  remainder  of  the  same \ncrediting period. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline shall undergo the \npost-registration change approval process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure, \nand  the  standardized  baseline  shall  be  valid  at  the  time  of  the  submission  of  the  post-\nregistration change approval request. \n\n136.

Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan \nform,  if  applicable,  and  the  A6.4  Sustainable  development  impact  form  containing  all \nparameters  used  to  monitor  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  the  sustainable \ndevelopment impacts and explaining how any negative environmental and social impacts \nhave been assessed, mitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in \nthe registered PDD. \n\n138. \n\nIf unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the \nDOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements \nand criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants \nmay request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4 \nSD Tool forms accordingly. \n\n139.  For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the \n\nmonitoring report as part of the investment analysis. \n\n8.7.  Calculation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n140.  The activity participants shall identify the formulae used by the registered A6.4 project for \n\nthe monitoring period and provide the calculations of the following: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nBaseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals; \n\nProject GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals; \n\nLeakage GHG emissions; \n\nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals. \n\n141.  Where projects involving removals also result in emission reductions, the accounting of \nremovals  and  emission  reductions  shall  be  separated  in  the  monitoring  report  in \naccordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity. \n\n32 of 39 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-002 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n142.  The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project with their estimates provided \nin the registered PDD. \n\n143.  For  any  registered  A6.4  project,  the  activity  participants  shall  explain  the  cause  of  any \nincrease in the actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the \nmonitoring  period  (e.g.,  higher  water  availability,  higher  plant  load  factor),  including  all \ninformation  (i.e.,  data  and/or  parameters)  that  is  different  from  what  is  stated  in  the \nregistered PDD. \n\n9.  Renewal of crediting period \n\n144.  The crediting period of a registered A6.4 project may be renewed if the host Party has \napproved the renewal when approving the project prior to its registration in accordance \nwith the activity cycle procedure. \n\n145.  To support a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project, the \nactivity participants shall, using the valid version of the applicable PDD form, update the \nsections of the PDD of the project relating to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nThe  baseline  emissions,  including  updating  the  downward  adjustment  as  per \nparagraphs 55 and 56 above; \n\nThe  BAU  scenario  and  emissions,  and  the  difference  between  the  baseline \nemissions  and  BAU  emissions  as  annual  and  total  amounts  with  respect  to  the \ncrediting period to be renewed; \n\nThe additionality by updating the regulatory analysis; \n\nThe estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable); \n\nThe monitoring plan (if applicable); \n\nThe A6.4 SD Tool forms; \n\nThe risk assessment and monitoring plan for projects involving removals and for \nemission reduction projects with reversal risks; \n\n(h) \n\nThe crediting period. \n\n146.  When  updating  the  PDD,  activity  participants  shall  apply  methodologies  in  one  of  the \n\nfollowing manners: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  use  the  valid  version  of  the  methodologies  and \nmethodological tools applied in the registered PDD; that is, either the latest version \nat the time of the submission of the request for renewal or the previous version if \nthe  submission  of  the  request  for  renewal  is  still  within  the  grace  period  of  the \nprevious version for use;22 \n\nIf any of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD was withdrawn after the \nregistration  of  the  project  and was  replaced  by  consolidated  methodologies, the \nactivity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies; \n\n22  Referred  to  in  the  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of  methodologies  and \n\nmethodological tools”. \n\n33 of 39 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-002 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(c) \n\nIf the project no longer meets the applicability conditions of the methodologies or \nmethodological  tools  mentioned  in  subparagraphs  (a)  or  (b)  above  due  to  the  \nmethodologies  or methodological tools revisions or due to an update of the project \nbaseline, the activity participants shall either: \n\n(i) \n\nSelect other applicable approved methodologies; or \n\n(ii)  Request, either through the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the \ncrediting period or by the activity participants, a clarification as to whether a \ndeviation from the valid version of the methodologies (including consolidated \nmethodologies thereof) or the methodological tools applied in the registered \nPDD, or from any other selected methodologies, or any other methodological \ntools applied in accordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable. \nThis clarification shall be made under the clarification process outlined in the \n“Procedure  for  development,  revision  and  clarification  of  baseline  and \nmonitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. \n\n147. \n\nIn updating the PDD of the registered A6.4 project in accordance with paragraphs 145 and \n146  above,  the  activity  participants  shall  consider  the  application  of  an  approved \nstandardized baseline to the project as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nThe activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved standardized \nbaseline if: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  standardized  baseline  is  applied  in  the  registered  PDD  and  the  valid \nversion of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the project and to \nthe methodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 146 above; or \n\n(ii)  The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD but the valid \nversion  of  the  standardized  baseline  whose  selection  is  mandatory23  is \napplicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with \nparagraph 146 above. However, if the submission of the request for renewal \nof  the  crediting  period  is  made  within  240  days  after  the  standardized \nbaseline became valid, the activity participants may update the PDD without \nselecting the standardized baseline. \n\n(b) \n\nIf the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD is \nno longer applicable to the project and/or to the valid version of the methodologies \napplied in the registered PDD due to a revision of the standardized baseline after \nthe registration of the project, the activity participants shall: \n\n(i) \n\nSelect another applicable approved standardized baseline; or \n\n(ii)  Use only the valid version of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD \nthat are still applicable to the project and that can be used independently for \nestimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals without using the \nstandardized baseline applied in the registered PDD; \n\n(c) \n\nThe  activity  participants  may  use  the  valid  version  of  an  applicable  approved \nstandardized baseline if: \n\n(i) \n\nThe standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD; and \n\n23  For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 11. \n\n34 of 39 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-002 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(ii)  The  standardized  baseline  does  not  require  its  mandatory  selection  but  is \napplicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with \nparagraph 146 above. \n\n148.  The activity participants shall demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update \n\nin accordance with paragraphs 149−150 below. \n\n149.  To demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update, the activity participants \nshall  take  into  account  the  requirements  of  the  applied  methodologies,  standardized \nbaselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n150. \n\nIf  data  and  parameters  used for  determining  the  original  baseline  were  determined  ex-\nante and were not monitored during the crediting period and are no longer valid, the activity \nparticipants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be \nprovided by the Supervisory Body. \n\n151.  The results of the process described in paragraphs 145–150 above shall be used to define \n\na new version of the PDD. \n\n152.  The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up to date. \n\n153. \n\nIf the activity participants plan to make, or have already made, a post-registration change \nto the project design effective from the start date of the new crediting period, they shall \nclearly  indicate  this  change  in  the  new  version of  the  PDD,  distinguishing  it  from  other \nupdates of information due to renewal of the crediting period. \n\n10.  Post-crediting monitoring and reporting \n\n154.  For  projects  involving  removals  and for  emission  reduction  projects  with  reversal  risks, \nactivity participants shall continue monitoring the project after the end of the last active \ncrediting period to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nAssess whether any reversals have occurred; \n\nQuantify the amount of reversals; and \n\nConfirm the continued storage of the GHGs. \n\n155.  Activity  participants  may  terminate  the  post-crediting monitoring, subject  to  approval  by \nthe  Supervisory  Body,  if  they  can  demonstrate,  by  providing  transparent  and  verifiable \ninformation, that: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or \n\nThe potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of \nthe relevant section of the removals standard (i.e., Remediation of reversals). \n\n11.  Voluntary deregistration of project \n\n156.  The  activity  participants  may  request  the  secretariat  to  deregister  an  A6.4  project  in \naccordance with the activity cycle procedure at any time after the registration of the project. \n\n157.  An A6.4 project that has been deregistered may not be reregistered as an A6.4 project or \n\nincluded as a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA. \n\n35 of 39 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-002 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nAppendix 1.

Use of applicable global warming potentials \n\n22. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the global warming potentials (GWPs) were correctly \napplied  in  both  the  project  design  document  (PDD)  and  the  monitoring  report,  in \naccordance with relevant requirements of the activity standard. \n\n6.  Validation for registration of projects \n\n6.1.  General requirements \n\n6.1.1.  Overarching requirement \n\n23. \n\nThe  DOE shall  determine  whether  the proposed A6.4  project  complies  with  all  relevant \nrequirements  in  the  activity  standard  for registration  of  the  project  under  the  Article 6.4 \nmechanism. \n\n6.1.2.  Standard auditing techniques \n\n24. \n\nThe DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. \n\n25.  When assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of validation specified \nthroughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including, \nbut not limited to: \n\n(a) \n\nDocument review, involving: \n\n(i)  Reviewing of data and information; \n\n(ii)  Crosschecking  the  information  provided  in  the  PDD  against  independent \nsources of information not used to determine the reliability of information in \nthe PDD. This may include where available, sectoral or local expertise of the \nDOE; and, if necessary, conducting independent background investigations; \n\n(b) \n\nConducting  follow-up  actions  (e.g.  on-site  inspection  and  telephone  or  e-mail \ninterviews), including: \n\n(i) \n\nInterviews with relevant stakeholders in the host country, such as personnel \nwith knowledge of the project design and implementation; \n\n10  All types of validation report forms are available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n11  All types of verification and certification report forms are available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n9 of 47 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(ii)  Crosschecks between information provided by interviewed personnel (i.e. by \nchecking sources or other interviews) to ensure that no relevant information \nhas been omitted; \n\nReferencing to available information relating to projects or technologies similar to \nthe proposed A6.4 project under validation; \n\nReviewing the appropriateness of formulae and accuracy of calculations, based on \nthe  selected  methodologies,  the  selected  standardized  baselines  and  the  other \napplied methodological regulatory documents; \n\nApplying  sampling  approach  in  accordance  with  the  standard  for  sampling  and \nsurveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory \nBody. \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n26. \n\nIt is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at validation for the proposed \nA6.4 project if: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nIts estimated annual average of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is \nmore than 100,000 t CO2 eq; or \n\nThere is pre-project information that is relevant to the requirements for registration \nof the project and may not be traceable after the implementation of the project; \n\nThe project is deemed to have high risk of uncertainty in terms of the achievement \nof GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals as estimated in the PDD, to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  guidance  to  be  provided  by  the \nSupervisory Body. \n\n27. \n\nFor  cases  that  are  not  referred  to  in  paragraph  26  above,  it  is  optional  for  the  DOE  to \nconduct  an  on-site  inspection  at  validation.  If  the  DOE  does  not  conduct  an  on-site \ninspection as a means of validation, it shall describe the alternative means used and justify \nthat  they  are  sufficient  for  the  purpose  of  validation.  If  the  DOE  conducts  a  remote \ninspection as  an  alternative means to  an  on-site inspection,  the  DOE should  follow the \nguidance contained in Appendix 1. \n\n28.  Where  no  specific  means  of  validation  is  specified,  the  DOE  shall  apply  the  standard \n\nauditing techniques described in paragraph 25 above. \n\n6.1.3.  Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests \n\n29. \n\nIf the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order \nto determine whether the proposed A6.4 project meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism \nrules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues are accurately identified, \nformulated, discussed and concluded in the validation report. \n\n30. \n\nThe DOE shall raise a corrective action request (CAR) if one of the following situations \noccurs: \n\n(a) \n\nMistakes have been made by the activity participants that may influence the ability \nof the proposed A6.4 project to achieve real, measurable, verifiable and additional \nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(b) \n\nThe applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have not been met; \n\n10 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n31. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\n34. \n\n(c) \n\nThere  is  a  risk  that  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  cannot  be \nmonitored or calculated. \n\nThe DOE shall raise a clarification request (CL) if the information provided by the activity \nparticipants is insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article \n6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have been met. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  raise  a  forward  action  request  (FAR)  if  issues  related  to  project \nimplementation that require review  during the first  verification  after the  validation  of the \nproposed A6.4 project are identified. The DOE shall not raise a FAR that relates to the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements for registration of the project. \n\nThe DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants take \nappropriate  actions,  such  as  rectifying  the  project  design  and/or  the  PDD,  or  providing \nadditional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s concerns. If this is not done, \nthe DOE shall not submit a request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project. \n\nThe DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its validation report. This reporting \nshall  explain  the  issues  raised,  the  responses  provided  by  the  activity  participants,  the \nmeans  of  validation  of  such  responses  and  references  to  any  resulting  changes  in  the \nPDD or its supporting documents, in accordance with paragraph 33 above. \n\n6.2.  Validation of compliance with specific requirements for registration \n\n6.2.1.  General \n\n35. \n\nThe DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in \nsections 5 and 6.1 above, whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with all relevant \nrequirements  for  registration  as  contained  in  the  activity  standard,  including  the \nrequirements on: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nNotification of prior consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism; \n\nCompliance with the host Party’s indication of activity types that it would approve; \n\nDescription of the project; \n\nAvoidance of double or revived registration; \n\nSelection of methodologies  and standardized  baselines  and their  applicability  to \nthe project; \n\nDeviation from or revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool, if \napplicable; \n\n(g) \n\nApplication of methodologies and standardized baselines, including in terms of: \n\n(i)  Defining of the project boundary and identifying of sources, sinks and GHGs \n\nincluded in the project boundary, and identifying of leakage; \n\n(ii) \n\nIdentifying of baseline scenario; \n\n(iii)  Demonstrating of additionality; \n\n(iv)  Assessing the risk of non-permanence of GHG emission reductions or net \n\nGHG removals and measures to address reversals if they occur; \n\n11 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(v)  Estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(vi)  Developing a monitoring plan; \n\n(h) \n\nSpecification of the project start date, crediting period type, and duration; \n\n(i) \n\n(j) \n\n(k) \n\n(l) \n\n(m) \n\nAnalysis  of  environmental  impacts,  social  impacts  and  sustainable  development \nimpacts; \n\nUndergoing local or subnational stakeholder consultation; \n\nUndergoing global stakeholder consultation; \n\nApproval of the project by the host Party; \n\nAuthorization  of  activity  participants  by  the  host  Party  and  other  participating \nParties; \n\n(n) \n\nPreparation of the modalities of communication statement. \n\n36.  When validating the compliance of the proposed A6.4 project with the requirements for \nregistration  referred  to  in  paragraph 35  above,  the  DOE  shall  additionally  follow  the \nspecific guidance on validation regarding some of these requirements provided in sections \n6.2.2−6.2.12 below. \n\n6.2.2.  Treatment of double or revived registration \n\n37. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  determine  the  compliance  with  the  requirements  relating  to  double  or \nrevived  registration  contained  in  the  activity  standard,  based  on  publicly  available \ninformation  and/or  information  provided  by  the  activity  participants  upon  the  DOE’s \nrequest. \n\n6.2.3.  Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines \n\n38. \n\n39. \n\n40. \n\n41. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are compatible with \nthe methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance \nwith paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. \n\nIf, based on local and sectoral knowledge, the DOE is aware that comparable information \nis available from credible sources other than that used in the PDD, it shall cross-check the \nPDD against such other sources to confirm that the A6.4 project meets the applicability \nconditions  of  the  selected  methodologies,  the  selected  standardized  baselines  and  the \nother applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  proposed  A6.4  project  has  selected  the \nstandardized baselines where their selection is mandatory. \n\nIf the DOE cannot determine the applicability of a selected methodology, methodological \ntool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed A6.4 project, the DOE shall request a \nclarification on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision \nand  clarification  of  methodologies  and  methodological  tools”  and/or  the  “Procedure: \nDevelopment, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. \n\n12 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n6.2.4.  Deviation from methodology or methodological tool \n\n42. \n\n43. \n\n44. \n\nThe  DOE  may  seek  a  clarification  from  the  Supervisory  Body  on  the  acceptability  of  a \ndeviation from the selected approved methodology or methodological tool in accordance \nwith  the  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of  methodologies  and \nmethodological tools” prior to the submission of a request for registration, if the DOE, when \nperforming  validation  of  the  proposed  A6.4  project,  or  upon  request  from  the  activity \nparticipants,  finds  that,  due  to  a  project-specific12  issue  implying  that  a  revision  of  the \nmethodology and/or methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the \nproject deviated from: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe selected methodology or methodological tool; or \n\nSections  in  the  selected  methodology  or  methodological  tool  that  are  not \nstandardized by the selected standardized baselines, in cases where the proposed \nA6.4 project applies standardized baselines. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  submit  an  assessment  of  the  case  including  demonstration  that  the \ndeviation does not require revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool. \nThe  DOE  shall  include  a  description  of  the  impact  of  the  deviation  on  GHG  emission \nreductions or net GHG removals by the proposed A6.4 project. \n\nAlternatively,  if  the  DOE  considers  that  a  revision  of  the  selected  methodology  or \nmethodological tool would be required to address the project situation, then the DOE shall \nsubmit,  or  shall  request  the  activity  participants  to  submit,  a  request  for  revision  of  the \nselected  methodology  or  methodological  tool  in  accordance  with  the  “Procedure: \nDevelopment, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”. \n\n12  Examples of project-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n(a)  The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a \ncertain method. The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 project face a difficulty in acquiring \nthe  specified  instrumentation  or  a  difficulty  in  implementing  the  measurement  method;  however, \nthey  can  achieve  comparable  accuracy  of  measured  parameters  using  an  alternative \ninstrumentation or measurement method; \n\n(b)  A proposed A6.4 project does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology \nfor a certain parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the project to estimate the \nparameter with equal reliability and accuracy; \n\n(c)  A minor deviation is sought for a project-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative. \nFor example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5% of \nrated capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the plant \nhas  never  been  operated  at  its  rated  capacity  but  at  a  capacity  which  is  much  below  its  rated \ncapacity  (20%  below  the  rated  capacity).

Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied \nmethodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or \nparameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided \n\n13  For  example,  if  a  project  involves  the  capture  of  landfill  gas  combined  with  use  of  the  landfill  gas  for \nenergy generation, additionality should be demonstrated for both parts together, and not separately for \nthe landfill gas capture part and for the energy generation part. \n\n14 For example, if a project involves the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the catalytic \n\nabatement of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at a nitric acid production plant. \n\n15 of 47 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(based on the choice of the baseline scenario, the context of the proposed A6.4 project \nand other evidence provided), and that the correct equations and parameters have been \nused, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines \nand the other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n59. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  verify  the  justification  given  in  the  PDD  for  the  choice  of  data  and \nparameters used in the equations as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nData and parameters fixed ex ante: If data and parameters will not be monitored \nthroughout the crediting period of the proposed A6.4 project but have already been \ndetermined  and  will  remain  fixed  throughout  the  crediting  period,  the  DOE  shall \ndetermine  whether  all  data  sources  and  assumptions  are  appropriate  and \ncalculations are correct as applicable to the proposed A6.4 project, and will result \nin an accurate or otherwise conservative estimate of GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals; \n\nData  and  parameters  to  be  monitored:  For  data  and  parameters  that  will  be \nmonitored or estimated on implementation and hence become available only after \nvalidation  of  the  proposed  A6.4  project,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the \nestimates provided in the PDD for these data and parameters are reasonable; \n\nIf the applied methodologies require that any of the data, parameters or estimates \nbe determined based on sampling in accordance with the standard for sampling \nand  surveys  for  Article  6.4  mechanism  activities  to  be  developed  by  the \nSupervisory  Body,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  sampling  efforts  were \nundertaken in accordance with such standard. \n\nFor  projects  involving  removals  that  also  result  in  emission  reductions,  the  DOE  shall \nassess whether the estimation of removals and emission reductions is separated and was \nundertaken in accordance with the applied methodology(ies).  \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the correct approach was applied for the estimation of \nBAU  emissions,  baseline  emissions,  project  emissions  and  leakage  emissions  in \naccordance  with \nthe  activity  standard  and  applied \nmethodology(ies). \n\nthe  relevant  provisions  of \n\nThe DOE shall assess whether the difference between the baseline emissions and BAU \nemissions  as  an  annual  and  total  amount  with  respect  to  the  crediting  period  was \nestimated correctly.  \n\nThe DOE shall assess whether the downwards adjustment of the baseline, if applicable, \nwas  applied  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  activity  standard  and  the \nrespective  provisions  of  the  methodologies  standard,  applied  methodologies  and  other \napplied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the leakage emissions were identified, described and \ncalculated  in accordance with  the  activity  standard  and relevant  applied  methodologies \nand other applied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\nThe DOE shall also assess whether the leakage emissions are avoided or minimized and \naccounted  for  in  line  with  the  respective  requirements  of  the  activity  standard,  applied \nmethodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.   \n\n60. \n\n61. \n\n62. \n\n63. \n\n64. \n\n65. \n\n16 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n6.2.5.8. \n\nMonitoring plan \n\n66. \n\n67. \n\n68. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  monitoring  plan  is  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements of the activity standard and is feasible to implement, including the feasibility \nof  the  monitoring  arrangements,  and  whether  the  means  of  implementation  of  the \nmonitoring plan, including the data management and quality assurance and quality control \nprocedures, are sufficient to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals \ncan be reported ex post and verified. \n\nIf  the  activity  participants  chose  to  delay  the  submission  of  the  monitoring  plan  for  the \nproposed A6.4 project in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE shall confirm and \ndocument that the submission of the monitoring plan is delayed. \n\nFor projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the \nDOE shall assess the revised monitoring plan every five years from the start of the first \ncrediting period and in any of the circumstances included in paragraph 57 above. \n\n6.2.6.

Permanent changes \n\n7.2.3.1. \n\nCorrections \n\n91. \n\nIf the activity participants have made corrections to project information or parameters fixed \nat  registration  of  the  A6.4  project  as  described  in  the  registered  PDD,  the  DOE  shall \ndetermine whether: \n\n(a) \n\nThe corrected  information  is  an  accurate  reflection  of  actual  project  information; \nand/or \n\n22 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(b) \n\nThe corrected parameters are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the \nregistered  monitoring  plan,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other \napplied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n7.2.3.2. \n\nInclusion of monitoring plan \n\n92. \n\nIf the activity participants chose to omit a monitoring plan at registration of the A6.4 project \nand  wish  to  include  it  thereafter,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  design  of  the \nmonitoring plan and other sections of the PDD comply with the relevant requirements in \nthe activity standard in accordance with section 6.2.5 above. \n\n7.2.3.3. \n\nChanges to the start date of the crediting period \n\n93. \n\n94. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether there has been no request for issuance having been \nsubmitted  for  the  A6.4  project  based  on  the  information  on  the  UNFCCC  website  and \nwhether the change is within the allowable limit specified in the activity standard. \n\nIf the DOE determines that both conditions referred to in paragraph 93 above are met, the \nDOE shall further determine whether the change would require full review and possible \nchange to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized baselines \nin accordance with the activity standard, and conduct validation accordingly. \n\n7.2.3.4. \n\nPermanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or A6.4 SD Tool \nforms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, \nA6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable \ndevelopment  impact  form),  or  permanent  deviation  of  monitoring  from  the \napplied  methodologies,  standardized  baselines  or  other  methodological \nregulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool \n\n95. \n\n96. \n\n97. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring \nplan described in the revised PDD are in compliance with the applied methodologies, the \napplied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring \nplan  or  the  permanent  deviation  of  the  monitoring  from  the  applied  methodologies,  the \napplied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological regulatory documents \nis likely to lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation of GHG emission reductions \nor net GHG removals, and if so, the DOE shall request the activity participants to apply \nconservative assumptions or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to \nensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as \na result of the permanent change or the permanent deviation. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the \nA6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and \nsocial management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), provided \nas  part  of  the  revised  PDD,  are  in  compliance  with  the  A6.4SD  Tool  and  relevant \nprovisions of the activity standard.  \n\n98. \n\nFor projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the \nDOE  shall  determine  whether  the  monitoring  plan  and  the  risk  assessment  plan  were \nreviewed  and  updated  in  accordance  with  relevant  provisions  of  the  activity  standard, \n\n23 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nremovals standard and other applied methodology regulatory documents every five years \nand in the circumstances specified in paragraph 57 above.  \n\n7.2.3.5. \n\nChanges to the project design \n\n99. \n\nIn  case  of  an  actual  change,  the  DOE  shall,  in  its  judgement,  by  means  of  an  on-site \ninspection or remote inspection and review of the description in the revised PDD submitted \nby  the  activity  participants  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  actual  change,  determine \nwhether this description accurately reflects the implementation, operation and monitoring \nof the modified A6.4 project. \n\n100.  The  DOE  shall,  by  means  of  an  on-site  inspection  or  remote  inspection,  assess  the \nimpacts of the actual change on the monitoring plan, the level of accuracy of the monitoring \nactivity,  and  compliance  with  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized \nbaselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n101.  The DOE shall, by means of reviewing the revised PDD against applicable methodological \nrequirements, determine whether the proposed or actual change would adversely affect \nthe conclusions of the validation report of the registered PDD with regard to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe  applicability  and  application  of  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied \nthe  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \nstandardized  baselines  and \ndocuments with which the A6.4 project has been registered; \n\nThe  project  boundary  and  any  implications  on  the  inclusion  or  exclusion  of \nemission sources or removal sinks and leakage emissions; \n\nThe compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied \nstandardized  baselines  and \nthe  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments; \n\nThe  level  of  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  monitoring  compared  with  the \nrequirements contained in the registered monitoring plan, including the frequency \nof  measurements, \nthe  quality  of  monitoring  equipment  (e.g.  calibration \nrequirements, the quality assurance and quality control procedures); \n\nThe additionality of the project; \n\nCompliance with the A6.4 SD Tool. \n\n102.  For projects that demonstrate additionality through investment analysis for which the PDD \nwas submitted for validation prior to the start date of the project, and for which the updated \ninvestment analysis is submitted as a post-registration change, the DOE shall determine \nwhether the investment analysis has been updated based on the data and information for \nthe investment analysis available at the start date of the project  in accordance with the \nrelevant  provisions  of the activity  standard  and other  applied methodological  regulatory \ndocuments.  \n\n103. \n\nIf the proposed or actual change affects the additionality of the registered A6.4 project, the \nDOE shall confirm that the project is still additional after the change. \n\n104.  Notwithstanding paragraph 103 above, if the registered A6.4 project applies an approved \nstandardized  baseline  that  standardizes  additionality  and  if  the  proposed  or  actual \nchanges affect the additionality of the project, the DOE shall determine whether the project \n\n24 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nwith the changes meets the additionality criteria (e.g. positive list of technologies) in the \napplied standardized baseline. \n\n105.  The DOE shall determine whether the revised PDD complies with all the requirements of \nthe  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents. \n\n106. \n\nIf the applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines have been updated to a later \nvalid version of them, or changed to other methodologies or standardized baselines, the \nDOE shall confirm that the revised PDD meets all requirements of the updated/changed \nmethodologies,  including  the  standards,  methodological  tools  and  guidelines  applied  in \naccordance  with  the  updated/changed  methodologies,  and/or  the  updated/changed \nstandardized baselines. \n\n107.  The DOE shall confirm the date when the change occurred, the reasons for the change \nand  whether  the  change  would  have  been  known  prior  to  the  registration  of  the  A6.4 \nproject, and determine how the change would impact on the overall operation/ability of the \nA6.4 project to deliver GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals as stated in the \nregistered PDD, and whether the revised estimation of GHG emission reductions or net \nGHG removals due to the change takes into account the applicable limits in accordance \nwith the activity standard. \n\n108. \n\n109. \n\nIn validating the revised PDD containing the proposed or actual change, and in preparing \nthe validation report, the DOE shall include information on how the findings of previous \nverification and certification reports, if any, have been taken into account. \n\nIf the changes to the project design affect the identification, assessment or monitoring of \nenvironmental, social or sustainable development impacts, the DOE shall assess whether \nthe  impacts  caused  by  the  changes  were  assessed  and  revised  versions  of  the  A6.4 \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguards  risk  assessment  form,  A6.4  Environmental  and \nsocial  management  plan  form (if  applicable)  and  A6.4  Sustainable  development  impact \nform were provided. The DOE shall assess, prior to or as part of the first verification of \nemission  reductions  or  net  removals,  whether  the  revised  A6.4  SD  Tool  forms  are  in \ncompliance with the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. \n\n7.2.4.  Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme \n\n110.  The  DOE  shall  determine  the  compliance  with  the  requirements  relating  to  registration \nunder or coverage by a programme, under any other international, regional, national, or \nsubnational  or  sector-wide  GHG  mitigation  crediting  scheme  contained  in  the  activity \nstandard based on the publicly available information and/or the information provided by \nthe activity participants upon its request. \n\n7.3.  Validation report \n\n111. \n\nIn its validation report for the post-registration changes, the DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nReport on all items listed in paragraph 82 above except for subparagraph 82(e); \n\nProvide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusion on the assessment of: \n\n(i)  Whether  the  revised  PDD  was  prepared  using  the  valid  version  of  the \napplicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable; \n\n25 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(ii)  Whether the information transferred to the later valid version of the PDD is \n\nmaterially the same as that in the registered PDD, as applicable; \n\n(iii)  Whether  the  revised  PDD  was  prepared  in  both  track-change  and  clean \n\nversions; \n\n(iv)  Whether  the  revised  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk \nassessment  form,  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  management  plan  form \nand A6.4 Sustainable development impact form are prepared using the valid \nversion  of  the  applicable  forms  and  following  the  instructions  therein,  as \napplicable; \n\n(v)  Whether the proposed or actual post-registration change complies with each \nrequirement  for  post-registration  change  conducted  in  accordance  with \nsections  7.1‒7.2  above,  including  the  CARs,  CLs  or  FARs  issued  to  the \nactivity participants and how they have been addressed by them. \n\n112.  The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the validation outcome, which will be one \n\nof the following options: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA positive validation opinion and the date of submission of the validation report as \npart of the request for approval of post-registration change to the secretariat; or \n\nA  negative  validation  opinion,  including  the  reasons  for  the  post-registration \nchange as documented having been determined as not complying with the relevant \nrequirements for post-registration changes. \n\n8.  Verification of implementation and monitoring \n\n8.1.  General requirements \n\n8.1.1.  Overarching requirements \n\n113.  The DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDetermine  whether  the  registered  A6.4  project  has  been  implemented  and  is \noperating in accordance with the registered PDD; \n\nDetermine  whether  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  have  been \nmonitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan. \n\n8.1.2.  Other requirements \n\n114.  The  DOE  shall  assess  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  information  on  GHG  emission \n\nreductions or net GHG removals provided in the monitoring report.18 \n\n115. \n\nIn addition to the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall review: \n\n(a) \n\nThe registered PDD, including the registered monitoring plan and/or the changes \nfrom the registered PDD, and the corresponding validation opinion; \n\n18  Quantitative information comprises the reported numbers in the monitoring report. Qualitative information \ncomprises information on internal management controls, calculation procedures, procedures for transfer \nof data, frequency of the monitoring reports, and review and internal audit of calculations. \n\n26 of 47 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe validation report; \n\nPrevious verification and certification reports, if any; \n\nThe  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other \napplied methodological regulatory documents; \n\nThe monitoring results of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable \ndevelopment impacts of the registered A6.4 project; \n\nAny other information and references relevant to the GHG emission reductions or \nnet  GHG  removals  by  the  registered  A6.4  project  (e.g.  IPCC  reports,  data  on \nelectricity  generation  in  the  national  grid  or  laboratory  analysis  and  national \nregulations). \n\n116. \n\nIn addition to reviewing the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall determine whether \nthe activity participants have addressed the FARs identified during validation or previous \nverification(s). \n\n8.1.3.  Quality of evidence \n\n117.  When  verifying  the reported GHG emission  reductions  or  net GHG removals,  the  DOE \nshall confirm that there is an audit trail that contains the evidence and records that validate \nor invalidate the stated figures. The audit trail shall include the source documents that form \nthe basis for assumptions and other information underlying the GHG data. \n\n118.  When assessing the audit trail, the DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nAddress whether there is sufficient evidence available, both in terms of frequency \n(time  period  between  evidence)  and  coverage  (in  covering  the  full  monitoring \nperiod); \n\nAddress  the  source  and  nature  of  the  evidence  (external  or  internal,  oral  or \ndocumented); \n\nCross-check the monitoring report against other sources, where available, such as \ncomparable  information  from  sources  other  than  those  used  in  the  monitoring \nreport to determine whether the stated figures are correct. \n\n119.  The DOE shall only certify GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that are based \n\non verifiable evidence. \n\n8.1.4.  Application of materiality \n\n8.1.4.1. \n\nGeneral \n\n120.  The  concept  of  materiality  is  applicable  to  the  verification  of  monitored  GHG  emission \nreductions  or  net  GHG  removals  achieved  by  all  types  of  registered  A6.4  projects. \nHowever, it is not applicable to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nUncertainties related to measurement; \n\nAddressing  temporary  deviations  and  permanent  changes  to  the  registered \nmonitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines, \n\n27 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nregardless  of  whether  corresponding  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \nremovals are above or below materiality thresholds. \n\n121.  A DOE that plans and conducts verification using the concept of materiality shall achieve \na reasonable level of assurance that the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG \nremovals  are  free  from material  errors,  omissions  or misstatements  in accordance  with \nparagraphs 122−132 below. \n\n122.  An  omission,  misstatement,  or  erroneous  reporting  of  information  is  material  if  it  might \nlead, at an aggregated level, to an overestimation of the total GHG emission reductions or \nnet  GHG  removals  achieved  by  a  registered  A6.4  project  equal  to  or  higher  than  the \nfollowing thresholds: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total \nemission reduction or removal equal to or more than 500,000 t CO2 eq per year;19 \n\n1  per  cent  of  the  emission  reductions  or  removals  for  projects  achieving  a  total \nemission reduction or removal of between 300,000 and 500,000 t CO2 eq per year; \n\n2  per  cent  of  the  emission  reductions  or  removals  for  projects  achieving  a  total \nemission reduction or removal of 300,000 t CO2 eq per year or less. \n\n123.  Recognizing that circumstances may exist that could cause the information reported by \nactivity  participants  to  be  materially  misstated,  the  DOE  should  plan  and  perform \nverifications  with  an  attitude  of  professional  scepticism  and  rely  on  its  professional \njudgement when applying the concept of materiality. \n\n124.  The application of the concept of materiality and reasonable level of assurance implies \nthat some data or information may not be checked. However, the DOE should design its \nverification and sampling plans to detect all material errors, omissions or misstatements, \nand any unchecked data or information should not contain any material errors, omissions \nor  misstatements.  A  DOE’s  verification  opinion  applies  to  100 per  cent  of  the  data  and \ninformation, even if the DOE may not have checked the entire data set and information. \n\n125.  Applying the concept of materiality does not mean that identified errors do not need to be \ncorrected;  if  an  error,  omission  or misstatement  is  identified  by the  DOE,  regardless  of \nwhether it is material or not, the DOE shall request activity participants to address it. \n\n8.1.4.2. \n\nConsideration of materiality in planning verification \n\n126.  The DOE should: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIdentify  the  materiality  threshold  referred  to  in  paragraph  122  above  that \ncorresponds to the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that \nthe specific registered A6.4 project will achieve; \n\nUnderstand  the  environment  in  which  the  registered  A6.4  project  operates,  the \nsources  of  project  emissions  within  the  project  boundary  and  the  leakage,  the \nmonitoring activities, the equipment used to monitor or measure project data, the \norigin and application of data used to calculate or measure the emissions, the data \n\n19  A year refers in this paragraph to a period of 12 consecutive months. \n\n28 of 47 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nflow, the internal quality control system, and the overall organization with respect \nto monitoring and reporting;20 \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nConduct  a  risk  assessment  to  identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  individual  or \naggregated material errors, omissions or misstatements that may occur within the \nthreshold based on elements in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above; \n\nDesign  verification  plans,  audit  procedures21  and  sampling  plans  whose  type, \ntiming22  and  extent  are  based  on  and  are  responsive  to  the  assessed  risks  of \nmaterial errors, omissions or misstatements. \n\n127.  The  materiality  thresholds  apply  to  the  total  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \nremovals  actually  achieved.  When  planning  verification,  the  DOE  should  apply  the \napplicable materiality threshold to the reported total emission reductions or removals. If, \nas a result of the verification, the initial reported total emission reductions or removals is \nrevised,  the  DOE  should  reapply  the  materiality  threshold  to  the  revised  total  emission \nreductions  or  removals  and,  if  needed,  make  adjustments  to  its  verification  plans  and \nsampling plans. \n\n8.1.4.3. \n\nConsideration of materiality in conducting verification \n\n128.  The DOE should: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApply verification plans, audit procedures and sampling plans; \n\nAssess  potential  errors,  omissions  and  misstatements  against  the  materiality \nthreshold to determine whether they are material individually or in aggregate and \nwhether further audit procedures are needed. \n\n129. \n\n130. \n\n131. \n\nIf an error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE should be aware that it may \nnot  be  an  isolated  occurrence  and  may  be  a  systemic  reoccurring  error.  For  example, \nother errors may exist if the DOE identifies that the error, omission or misstatement arose \nfrom a breakdown in the activity participants’ internal quality control and quality assurance \nsystem. \n\nIf an immaterial error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall request the \nactivity  participants  to  address  it  and  should  determine  whether  additional  audit \nprocedures should be conducted in order to reach a reasonable level of assurance that \nthe claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are free from material error, \nomission or misstatement. \n\nIf a material error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall, depending on the \ncircumstances of the error, immediately request the activity participants to address it, or \nconduct additional audit procedures to confirm or determine the context and magnitude of \nthe error, omission or misstatement and then request the activity participants to address \nit. \n\n20  Adapted from European Union. 2007.

Standard auditing techniques \n\n133.  The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. \n\n134. \n\nIn  assessing  the  information,  the  DOE  shall  apply  the  means  of  verification  specified \nthroughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including \nbut not limited to: \n\n(a) \n\nDocument review, involving: \n\n(i) \n\nA review of data and information; \n\n(ii)  A review of the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the \napplied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological \nregulatory  documents,  paying  particular  attention  to  the  frequency  of \nmeasurements,  the  quality  of  metering  equipment  including  calibration \nrequirements, and the quality assurance and quality control procedures; \n\n(iii)  An  evaluation  of  data  management  and  the  quality  assurance  and  quality \ncontrol  system  in  the  context  of  their  influence  on  the  generation  and \nreporting of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(b) \n\nFollow-up  actions  (e.g.  on-site  inspection  and  telephone  or  e-mail  interviews), \nincluding: \n\n(i) \n\nAn assessment of the implementation and operation of the registered A6.4 \nproject as per the registered PDD or latest approved revised PDD; \n\n(ii)  A review of information flows for generating, aggregating and reporting the \n\nmonitoring parameters; \n\n(iii) \n\nInterviews with relevant personnel to determine whether the operational and \ndata  collection  procedures  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nregistered monitoring plan; \n\n(iv)  Cross checks between the information provided in the monitoring report and \ndata  from  other  sources  such  as  plant  logbooks,  inventories,  purchase \nrecords or similar data sources to determine whether the information in the \nmonitoring report is reliable; \n\n(v)  A check of the monitoring equipment including calibration performance and \nobservations  of  monitoring  practices  against  the  requirements  of  the \nregistered  monitoring  plan, \nthe  applied \nstandardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments; \n\nthe  applied  methodologies, \n\n(vi)  A review of calculations and assumptions made in determining the GHG data \n\nand GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(vii)  An identification of quality control and quality assurance procedures in place \nto  prevent,  or  identify  and  correct,  any errors  or omissions  in the  reported \nmonitoring parameters; \n\n30 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(c) \n\nSampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for \nArticle  6.4  mechanism  activities  to  be  developed  by  the  Supervisory  Body, \nincluding: \n\n(i) \n\nA random sampling for cases where the activity participants did not apply a \nsampling approach for monitoring; \n\n(ii)  An acceptance sampling or another sampling approach for cases where the \n\nactivity participants applied a sampling approach for monitoring. \n\n135. \n\nIt  is  mandatory  for  the  DOE  to  conduct  an  on-site  inspection  at  verification  for  the \nregistered A6.4 project if: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nIt is the first verification for the DOE with regard to this project; \n\nMore than three years have elapsed since the last on-site inspection conducted for \nverification for the project; or \n\nThe project has achieved more than 300,000 t CO2 eq of GHG emission reductions \nor  net  GHG  removals  since  the  last  verification  when  an  on-site  inspection  was \nconducted. \n\n136.  For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 135 above, it is optional for the DOE to \nconduct  an  on-site  inspection  at  verification.  If  the  DOE  does  not  conduct  an  on-site \ninspection  as  a  means  of  verification,  it  shall  describe  the  alternative  means  used  and \njustify that they are sufficient for the purpose of verification. If the DOE conducts a remote \ninspection as  an  alternative means to  an  on-site inspection,  the  DOE should  follow the \nguidance contained in Appendix 1. \n\n137. \n\nIf any issue related to the project design, including those attributable to the lack of on-site \ninspection at previous verification, is identified at the verification, the DOE that detected \nthe issue shall rectify it through the post-registration change process in accordance with \nthe activity cycle procedure. \n\n138.  Where no specific means of verification is specified, the DOE should apply the standard \n\nauditing techniques described in paragraph 134 above. \n\n8.1.6.  Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests \n\n139. \n\nIf the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order \nto determine whether the implementation or the operation of the registered A6.4 project, \nor the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals meets the relevant \nArticle  6.4 mechanism rules and  requirements, the  DOE shall  ensure  that  these  issues \nare  accurately  identified,  formulated,  discussed  and  concluded  in  the  verification  and \ncertification report. \n\n140.  The DOE shall raise a CAR if one of the following situations occurs: \n\n(a) \n\nNon-compliance  with  the  registered  monitoring  plan, the  applied methodologies, \nthe applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory \ndocuments  is  found  in  monitoring  and  reporting,  and  has  not  been  sufficiently \ndocumented  by  the  activity  participants,  or  if  the  evidence  provided  to  prove \nconformity is insufficient; \n\n31 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nModifications to the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 project, or \nthe monitoring or GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, has not been \nsufficiently documented by the activity participants; \n\nMistakes  have  been  made  by  the  activity  participants  in  applying  assumptions, \ndata or calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that may \nimpact the quantity of emission reductions or removals; \n\nIssues identified in a FAR during the validation or the previous verification(s) have \nnot been resolved by the activity participants. \n\n141.  The  DOE  shall  raise  a  CL  if  the  information  provided  by  the  activity  participants  is \ninsufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism \nrules and requirements have been met. \n\n142.  The  DOE  shall  raise  a  FAR  if  issues  related  to  monitoring  and  reporting  that  require \n\nattention and/or adjustment at the next verification are identified. \n\n143.  The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify \nthe monitoring report, or provide additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s \nconcerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs. \n\n144.  The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its verification and certification report. \nThis  reporting  shall  explain  the  issues  raised,  the  responses  provided  by  the  activity \nparticipants, the means of verification of such responses and references to any resulting \nchanges in the monitoring report or its supporting documents. \n\n8.2.  Verification of compliance with specific requirements for issuance \n\n8.2.1.  General \n\n145.  The DOE shall determine, by following the general verification requirements referred to in \nsections 5 and 8.1 above, whether the monitoring complies with all relevant requirements \nfor monitoring as contained in the activity standard, including the requirements on: \n\n(a) \n\nGeneral requirements, including on: \n\n(i) \n\nImplementation  and  operation  of  the  project  as  per  the  description  in  the \nregistered PDD; \n\n(ii)  Continuous monitoring; \n\n(iii)  Coverage of the monitoring period; \n\n(iv)  Presentation of monitoring results by year of occurrence of GHG emission \n\nreductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(v)  Preparation of monitoring reports in chronological order and separation by \n\ncrediting periods; \n\n(vi)  Application of appropriate GWPs; \n\n(vii)  Maintenance of monitoring results; \n\n(b) \n\nAvoidance of double issuance; \n\n32 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\nDescription of implemented registered project; \n\nDescription of monitoring system; \n\nReversal  related  actions  for  projects  involving  removals  and  emission  reduction \nprojects with reversal risks; \n\nProvision of data and parameters used; \n\nEnvironmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts; \n\nCalculation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.; \n\nContinuous engagement of stakeholders. \n\n146.  When verifying the compliance of the implementation and the operation of the registered \nA6.4 project and monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals with the \nrequirements for implementation, operation and monitoring referred to in paragraph 145 \nabove,  the  DOE  shall  additionally  follow  the  specific  guidance  on  verification  regarding \nsome of these requirements provided in sections 8.2.2−8.2.10 below. \n\n147.  The DOE shall ensure, before submitting the request for first issuance for the project, that \n\nthe host Party statement of authorization of the use of A6.4ERs was provided.  \n\n8.2.2.  Avoidance of double issuance \n\n148.  The  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  A6.4  project  is  also  registered,  or  covered  by  a \nprogramme,  under  any  other  international,  regional,  national,  or  subnational  GHG \nmitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance based on the confirmation \nfrom  any  other  crediting  scheme,  if  applicable,  publicly  available  information  and/or the \nother information obtained from the activity participants. \n\n149. \n\nIf  the  DOE  determines  that the  A6.4  project  is registered,  or covered  by  a  programme, \nunder other crediting scheme, the DOE shall additionally determine whether the activity \nparticipants have obtained a confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same \nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs \nhave not been or will not be credited under the other crediting scheme. \n\n8.2.3.  Project implementation and operation \n\n150.  The DOE shall identify any concerns related to the conformity of the  implemented A6.4 \n\nproject and its operation with the registered PDD and determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  project  has  been  implemented  and  is  operating  in  accordance  with  the \ndescription contained in the registered PDD; or \n\nAny deviation or the proposed or actual changes in the implementation or operation \nof the project comply with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. \n\n151.  By  means  of  an  on-site  inspection  or  other  means  of  verification  in  accordance  with \nparagraphs 135 or 136 above, the DOE shall assess that all physical features (technology, \nproject equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the registered A6.4 project \nspecified in the registered PDD are in place and that the activity participants are operating \nthe project as per the registered PDD or latest approved revised PDD. \n\n152.  For each monitoring period, the DOE shall report: \n\n33 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe implementation status of the registered A6.4 project. For a project that consists \nof more than one site, the DOE shall describe the status of implementation and the \nstarting date of operation for each site. For a project with phased implementation, \nthe  DOE  shall  state  the  progress  of  the  project  achieved  in  each  phase  under \nverification. If the phased implementation is delayed, the DOE shall describe the \nreasons and present the expected implementation dates; \n\nThe actual operation of the registered A6.4 project; \n\nThe  information  (data  and  variables)  provided  in  the  monitoring  report  that  is \ndifferent  from  that  stated  in  the  registered  PDD  or  any  latest  approved  revised \nPDD, and has caused an increase in the estimates of GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals in the current monitoring period or is highly likely to increase \nthe estimates in future monitoring periods, if appliable;23 \n\nAn opinion on the cause of any increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or \nnet  GHG  removals  achieved  by  the  registered  A6.4  project  in  the  current \nmonitoring period that was reported in monitoring report, if applicable. \n\n153.  For projects that demonstrate additionality through investment analysis for which the PDD \nwas  submitted  for  validation  prior  to  the  start  date  of  the  project,  and  for  which  the \ninvestment analysis was not updated through the submission of a request for approval of \npost-registration changes, the DOE, at the first verification, shall determine whether the \ninvestment  analysis  has  been  updated  based  on  the  data  and  information  for  the \ninvestment  analysis  available  at  the  start  date  of  the  project  in  accordance  with  the \nrelevant  provisions  of the activity  standard  and other  applied methodological  regulatory \ndocuments.  \n\n8.2.4.  Monitoring plan \n\n154.  The DOE shall determine whether the registered monitoring plan is in accordance with the \napplied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents based on the actual implementation of the project. \n\n155.  For monitoring aspects that are not specified in the applied methodologies, the applied \nstandardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the \nDOE should highlight issues which may enhance the level of accuracy and completeness \nof the registered monitoring plan. \n\n8.2.5.  Monitoring activities \n\n156.  The DOE shall determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe registered monitoring  plan  has  been  properly  implemented  and followed  by \nthe activity participants; \n\nAll parameters stated in the registered monitoring plan have been monitored and \nupdated as applicable; \n\n23  Discrepancies may include higher water availability than expected in the PDD, which may increase the \nelectricity  output  from  a  hydropower  plant,  or  a  higher  plant  load  factor  owing  to  higher  bagasse \navailability during the crushing season, which increases the production of steam and electricity. \n\n34 of 47 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nThe equipment used for monitoring is controlled and calibrated in accordance with \nthe  registered  monitoring  plan, \nthe  applied \nstandardized  baselines, the  other  applied methodological  regulatory  documents, \nlocal/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification; \n\nthe  applied  methodologies, \n\nMonitoring results are consistently recorded as per the approved frequency; \n\nQuality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied in accordance \nwith the registered monitoring plan. \n\n157. \n\nIf  the  activity  participants  applied  a  sampling  approach  to  determining  data  and \nparameters monitored, the DOE shall assess the compliance of the sampling efforts and \nsurveys with the validated sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and \nsurveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. \n\n158.  The DOE shall list each parameter required by the registered monitoring plan and state \nhow it verified the information flow (from data generation and aggregation, to recording, \ncalculation  and  reporting)  for  these  parameters  including  the  values  in  the  monitoring \nreport. \n\n159. \n\n For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the \nDOE  shall  determine  whether  the  monitoring  report  includes  the  following  specific \nelements  as  per  the  activity  standard  and  the  respective  provisions  of  the  removals \nstandard and any applied methodological regulatory documents:  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nDescription of the monitoring activities and methods used;  \n\nEstimated  GHG  emission  reductions  and/or  net  removals  occurring  during  the \nmonitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty; \n\nData collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a \nsummary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed; \n\nRecords  and  logs  of  the  observed  events  of  GHG  release  that  potentially  could \nhave  led  to  the  reversal  of  removals  and/or  emission  reductions  along  with  a \nsummary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period \ncovered by the monitoring report; \n\nInformation on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent \nwith the risk mitigation measures described in the registered PDD; \n\nInformation  on  how  any  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  have  been \nassessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the \nregistered PDD.  \n\n8.2.6.  Calibration frequency for measuring instruments \n\n160.  The DOE shall determine whether the calibration of the measuring equipment that has an \nimpact on the claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is conducted by \nthe  activity  participants  at  the  frequency  specified  in  the  applied  methodologies,  the \napplied standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents \nor the registered monitoring plan. \n\n161. \n\nIf,  during  the  verification  for  a  certain  monitoring  period,  the  DOE  identifies  that  the \ncalibration  has  been  delayed  and  the  calibration  has  been  implemented  after  the \n\n35 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmonitoring  period  in  consideration  (i.e.  the  results  of  delayed  calibration  are  available), \nreferring to the illustrative examples in Appendix 2, the DOE may conclude its verification, \nprovided  the  following  conservative  approach  is  adopted  in  the  calculation  of  GHG \nemission reductions or net GHG removals: \n\n(a) \n\nApplying  the  maximum  permissible  error24  of  the  instrument  to  the  measured \nvalues taken during the period between the scheduled date of calibration and the \nactual date of calibration, if the results of the delayed calibration do not show any \nerrors  in  the  measuring  equipment,  or  if  the  error  is  smaller  than  the  maximum \npermissible error; or \n\n(b) \n\nApplying the error identified in the delayed calibration test, if the error is beyond \nthe maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment. \n\n162.  The DOE shall confirm that the error has been applied: \n\n163. \n\n164. \n\n165. \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIn a conservative manner, such that the adjusted measured values of the delayed \ncalibration  shall  result  in  fewer  claimed  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \nremovals; \n\nFor all measured values taken during the period between the scheduled date of \ncalibration and the actual date of calibration. \n\nIf the results of the delayed calibration are not available, or the calibration has not been \nconducted at the time of the verification, the DOE, prior to finalizing the verification, shall \nrequest  the  activity  participants  to  conduct  the  required  calibration  and shall  determine \nwhether  the  activity  participants  have  calculated GHG  emission  reductions  or  net GHG \nremovals conservatively using the approach mentioned in paragraph 161 above. \n\nIf  the  DOE  determines  that  it  is  not  possible  for  the  activity  participants  to  conduct  the \ncalibration  at  the  frequency  specified  in  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied \nstandardized  baselines,  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents,  or  the \nregistered monitoring plan due to reasons beyond the control of the activity participants,25 \nthe DOE shall follow the applicable requirements related to post-registration changes in \nsection 7 above. \n\nIf neither the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied \nmethodological  regulatory  documents,  nor  the  registered  monitoring  plan  specify  any \nrequirements  for  calibration  frequency  for  the  measuring  equipment,  the  DOE  shall \ndetermine whether the equipment is calibrated either in accordance with the specifications \nof  the  local/national  standards,  or  as  per  the  manufacturer’s  specification.  If  neither \nlocal/national standards nor the manufacturer’s specification are available, the DOE shall \ndetermine whether the equipment is calibrated in accordance with the specifications of the \ninternational standards. \n\n24  The  maximum  permissible  errors  of  all  the  measuring  instruments  are  specified  by  the  respective \n\nmanufacturers as part of their technical specifications. \n\n25  For example, due to the contractual terms between the activity participant and purchasing/selling entities. \n\n36 of 47 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\n8.2.7.  Reversal  related  actions  for  projects  involving  removals  and  emission  reduction \n\nprojects with reversal risks \n\n166. \n\n167. \n\nIn cases of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that could potentially \nlead  to  reversal,  the  DOE  shall  determine  on  the  basis  of  transparent  and  verifiable \nevidence  whether  the  event  as  per  the  preliminary  assessment  report,  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  activity  standard,  respective  provisions  of  the \nremovals  standard  on  reversal-related  actions  and  any  other  relevant  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents, results in an actual reversal or not.  \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  does  not  approve  the  preliminary  assessment  report,  or  if  the \npreliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual \nreversal  and  a  monitoring  report  is  prepared,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the \nmonitoring report is in compliance with requirements of the activity standard, respective \nprovisions  of  the  removals  standard,  and  any  other  relevant  applied  methodological \nregulatory documents.  \n\n168.  The  DOE  shall  also  assess  whether  the  monitoring  report  accurately  estimates  the \nmagnitude of reversals and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable.  \n\n169.  The DOE shall also assess whether, following the submission of the monitoring report: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  risk  assessment  of  the  activity  has  been  updated  and  the  risk  rating  of  the \nactivity has been revised; \n\nThe compliance with requirements and safeguards contained in the Article 6.4 SD \nTool, taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts caused \nby the reversal and plans developed to prevent the recurrence of such negative \nenvironmental and social impacts, has been reviewed.   \n\n8.2.8.  Data and calculation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n170.  The DOE shall assess the data and calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG \n\nremovals achieved by the registered A6.4 project and determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\nA complete set of data for the specified monitoring period is available. If only partial \ndata is available because activity levels or non-activity parameters have not been \nmonitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan, the DOE shall assess \nwhether: \n\n(i) \n\nThe most conservative values approach is applied to the parameters for the \nentire  non-monitoring  period  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  relating  to \ntemporary  deviation  from  the  registered  monitoring  plan,  the  applied \nmethodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard; \nor \n\n(ii)  Alternative  monitoring  arrangements  for  the  non-monitoring  period  are \ndescribed, whether they apply conservative assumptions or discount factors \nto the calculations, and whether the alterative monitoring arrangements have \nbeen approved by the Supervisory Body under the prior-approval track or to \nbe  approved  by  the  Supervisory  Body  under  the  issuance  track  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  relating  to  temporary  deviation  from  the \nregistered  monitoring  plan,  the  applied  methodologies  or  the  applied \n\n37 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nstandardized  baselines  in  the  activity  standard  and  the  activity  cycle \nprocedure; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe  information  provided  in  the  monitoring  report  has  been  cross-checked  with \nother  sources  such  as  plant  logbooks,  inventories,  purchase  records  and \nlaboratory analysis; \n\nThe  calculations  of  baseline  GHG  emissions  or  baseline  net  GHG  removals, \nproject GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals, and leakage GHG emissions \nhave been carried out in accordance with the formulae and methods described in \nthe  registered  monitoring  plan, \nthe  applied \nstandardized  baselines  and \nthe  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments; \n\nthe  applied  methodologies, \n\n(d)  Where  projects  involving  removals  also  result  in  emission  reductions,  the \naccounting  of  removals  and  emission  reductions  has  been  separated  in  the \nmonitoring report in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity;  \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nAny assumptions used in emission or removal calculations have been justified; \n\nAppropriate  emission  factors,  IPCC  default  values,  GWPs  and  other  reference \nvalues have been correctly applied; \n\nIf the project applies an approved standardized baseline that standardizes baseline \nemissions, the standardized values of the parameters have been applied using the \ncorrect version of the applied standardized baseline in accordance with the activity \nstandard. \n\n171.  The DOE shall provide: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nAn indication of whether a complete set of data for the monitoring period was not \navailable because activity levels or non-activity parameters were not monitored in \naccordance  with  the  registered  monitoring  plan,  and  if  so,  whether  the  most \nconservative values approach was applied or alternative monitoring arrangements \nwere proposed or have been approved by the Supervisory Body; \n\nA description of how the DOE cross-checked reported data; \n\nA  confirmation  that  appropriate  methods  and  formulae  for  calculating  baseline \nGHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals, project GHG emissions or actual \nnet GHG removals and leakage GHG emissions have been followed; \n\nAn opinion on whether assumptions, emission factors and default values that were \napplied in the calculations have been justified. \n\n8.2.9.  Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts  \n\n172.  The  DOE  shall  verify  the  appropriateness,  relevance  and  sufficiency  of  information \nprovided  in  the  monitoring  of  the  environmental  and  social  indicators  in  the  A6.4 \nEnvironmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators \nin the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, as reported in a monitoring report. \n\n173. \n\nIf  the  DOE observes  any  deviation from the  information  in  the  A6.4  Environmental  and \nsocial  management  plan  form  and  the  A6.4  Sustainable  development  impact  form  that \nwere validated at registration, it shall provide its opinion to the activity participants on the \n\n38 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nobserved  deviation,  indicating  whether  the  A6.4  activity  is  still  within  the  social  and \nenvironmental  impact  and/or  SD  impact  defined  in  the  A6.4  Environmental  and  social \nsafeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form \nand A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. \n\n174.  The DOE shall review any input and comments received via the continuous engagement \nof local stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, conduct interviews with local \nstakeholders and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post fulfilment \nof risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity. \n\n175.  The  DOE  shall  confirm  that  the  activity  participants  have  measured,  monitored,  and \nreported parameters established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan \nform  and  the  A6.4  Sustainable  development  impact  form  submitted  at  the  registration \nstage. \n\n176.  For projects that successfully transitioned from the clean development mechanism (CDM) \nand  that  prepared  a  “Sustainable  development  co-benefits  description  report”  in \naccordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool” at the time of transition, \nthe  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  monitoring  report  includes  the  outcome  of  the \nmonitoring  of  the  sustainable  development  co-benefits  of  the  project  based  on  the \ndocument  describing  how  the  activity  participant  monitors  sustainable  development  co-\nbenefits  of  the  activity,  including  the  frequency  of  reporting  of  monitoring  results,  in \naccordance with relevant provisions of the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism”.  \n\n8.2.10. Continuous engagement of stakeholders \n\n177. \n\nIf the activity participants have received comments on the implementation or operation of \nthe  A6.4  project  from  local  stakeholders  after  its  registration  through  the  process  of \ncontinuous engagement of stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE \nshall determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the \ncomments in the implementation or operation of the project, as appropriate. \n\n178.  The  DOE  shall  also  determine  whether  comments  on  the  compliance  of  the  registered \nA6.4  project  with  applicable  Article  6.4  mechanism  rules  and  regulations  have  been \nsubmitted from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations and \npublished on the UNFCCC website in accordance with the activity cycle procedure, and if \nso, determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the \ncomments. \n\n8.3.  Verification and certification report \n\n179.

Guidance  on \n\nremote \nalternative means to an on-site inspection \n\ninspection  as  an \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nIn this document, a remote inspection for the purpose of validation or verification refers to \nthe activities where the validation or verification team of the designated operational entity \n(DOE)  carries  out  the  same  activities  as  in  a  physical  on-site  inspection  through \ninformation and communication technologies (ICT) tools. \n\nThere are risks posed by remote inspections, including in the use of ICT tools. In order to \nensure a level of assurance of the validation or verification as comparable as in an on-site \ninspection, there needs to be measures in place to reduce these risks. \n\nThe DOE should identify risks pertaining to the remote inspection for each validation or \nverification activity and establish and implement measures to eliminate or reduce those \nrisks.  A  DOE  should  also  integrate  this  risk  assessment  process  into  its  quality \nmanagement systems. \n\nThe  DOE  should  implement  the  following  actions  at  different  stages  of  a  validation  or \nverification activity: \n\n(a) \n\nRisk assessment stage: The feasibility of conducting a remote inspection depends \non  the  risk  level  and  whether  measures  to  eliminate  or  reduce  the  risks  are \nadequate  for  the  validation  or  verification.  Therefore,  a  risk  assessment  to  be \nconducted by the DOE should cover the aspects below: \n\n(i) \n\nIdentifying and assessing the risks inherent in a remote inspection. The risks \nmay be at different levels and could cover different aspects; hence the risk \nidentification and assessment should cover: \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nRisks related to organizational and procedural aspects, which include \ngeneric risks. These risks could relate to the following: the quality of \nthe  internet  connection;  the  quality  of  ICT  tools  such  as  good \ncamerawork to ensure a reasonably good view for the validation or \nverification  team;  the  amount  of  documentation  to  be  reviewed \nremotely;  whether  relevant  data  flows  can  be  accessed  remotely; \nwhat  record-keeping  system  is  established;  the  maintaining  of \nconfidentiality  and  personnel  data  protection;  and  the  required \ncompetence and resources of the validation or verification team; \n\nRisks  related  to  the  project  and  its  configuration,  which  present \nproject-specific risks: The risks could relate to the following: whether \nthe boundary and features of the project can be evaluated remotely; \nwhether the remote inspection would enable the DOE to observe any \nsources of emissions that are not included in the project; how control \nactivities are carried out; and how calculations are tracked and cross-\nchecked; \n\nRisks  related  to  monitoring  aspects:  The  risks  could  relate  to  the \nfollowing:  the  complexity  of  the  monitoring  parameters  and  the \nmonitoring  plan;  data  processing  and  reporting;  whether  a  fiscal \nmetering  method  is  applied;  the  sampling  or  surveys  conducted  at \nhousehold  level;  what  status  of  the  monitoring  period  is  being \n\n44 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nverified;  and  whether  data  and  information  have  been  thoroughly \nchecked  during  previous  verifications  or  whether  such  data  and \ninformation  can  be  checked  subsequently  without  an  on-site \ninspection; \n\n(ii)  Establishing measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. The DOE \nshould  establish  measures  to  eliminate  or  reduce  each  identified  risk  at \ndifferent levels described in subparagraph (i) above; \n\n(iii)  The risk assessment pertaining to the remote inspection may be done in the \ncontext  of the  application of  materiality following  the  relevant  provisions in \nthis standard; \n\n(b) \n\nPlanning  stage:  Based  on  risk  assessment  outcomes,  the  DOE  should  plan  the \nvalidation or verification activity as follows: \n\n(i)  Composing  a  validation  or  verification  team  with  sufficient  members  that \nhave  the  knowledge,  skill  and  solid  professional  judgement  required  in  an \non-site inspection in conjunction with additional competence in applying ICT \ntools; \n\n(ii)  Conducting  a  desk  review  to  gain  a  prior  understanding  of  records  and \n\ndocumentation control processes of the project participants; \n\n(iii)  Establishing a validation or verification plan to clearly define the tasks to be \ndone  during  the  remote  inspection,  taking  into  account  the  established \nmeasures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. This includes a detailed \nallocation  of  responsibilities  by  different  validation  or  verification  team \nmembers with the required knowledge and specific time zones to ensure the \nteam members audit separately and make the best use of time; \n\n(iv)  Determining ICT tools to be used with the activity participants and conducting \na test on the agreed ICT tools before the remote inspection to ensure that \nthere is a stable connection and understanding of how to use such ICT tools. \nThe DOE should also ensure that there is a backup plan in case there is a \nconnection issue; \n\n(c) \n\nImplementation stage: During the remote inspection, the DOE should implement \nmeasures it has established to mitigate the identified risks, while conducting the \nvalidation or verification following the relevant requirements of this standard. At this \nstage, the DOE may decide to extend or terminate the remote inspection if it finds \nduring the remote inspection that the actual risks are higher than initially assessed. \n\n(d) \n\nPost-remote inspection stage: the DOE should: \n\n(i) \n\nAssess  whether  another  round  of  remote  inspection  is  needed  while \nreviewing  the  activity  participants’  responses  to  clarification  requests, \ncorrective action requests and/or forward action requests; \n\n(ii)  Ensure that its technical review process is able to identify any risks that were \n\nnot identified during the risk assessment stage. \n\n45 of 47 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-003 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects \nVersion 02.0 \n\nAppendix 2.

It \nmay include categories of goods, energy and energy carriers that are supplied into \nthe  project  location  and  are  required  for  the  implementation  of  the  CP,  such  as \nfossil fuel, by-product of a process, biomass, solar, wind, or geothermal heat. \n\n86. \n\nIf the CP involves the implementation of distributed units in households and the conditions \nreferred to in paragraph 84 above are not met, the activity participants shall request a DOE \nto validate and confirm by other means that the CP will not lead to the discontinuation or \n\n24 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmodification of the former project, and does not decrease the GHG emission reductions \nor net GHG removals by the former project, in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation \nand  verification  standard  for  programmes  of  activities”  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the \nvalidation and verification standard). \n\n87. \n\nIn all other cases, the activity participants may submit a communication to the Supervisory \nBody to request clarification prior to the inclusion of the CP in the registered PoA. \n\n7.4.  Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines \n\n88. \n\n89. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  select  methodologies  for  the  CP  in  accordance  with  the \ngeneric  CP.  If  a  methodology  applied  to  the  generic  CP  has  been  revised  by  the \nSupervisory Body, the validity of the version of the methodology and the necessity of post-\nregistration  change  to  the  registered  A6.4  PoA  to  apply  the  new  version  of  the \nmethodology prior to the inclusion of the CP shall follow the corresponding rules for validity \nof  methodology  contained  in  the  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of \nmethodologies and methodological tools”. \n\nIf an applicable standardized baseline is available for the CP, the mandatory or optional \nselection of the standardized baseline shall be in accordance with the generic CP. If the \ngeneric CP does not refer to the selection of a standardized baseline but an applicable \nstandardized baseline is available at the time of the inclusion of the CP in the registered \nA6.4 PoA, the activity participants shall or may select the standardized baseline depending \non the mandatory19 or optional conditions for its selection, provided that the development \nof  the  standardized  baseline  is  consistent  with  the  approach  to  setting  a  baseline \ndescribed in the generic CP. \n\n7.5.  Application of methodologies and standardized baselines \n\n7.5.1.  General requirements \n\n90. \n\n91. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  provide  the  references  (titles,  versions  and  UNFCCC \nreference  numbers)  of  the  selected  methodologies  and  the  selected  standardized \nbaselines that are applied to the CP, including any other methodologies or methodological \ntools to which the selected methodologies refer, in accordance with the generic CP. \n\nThe activity participants shall demonstrate that the CP meets all conditions of the eligibility \ncriteria referred to in paragraph 72(h) above that ensure compliance with the applicability \nof the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied \nmethodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological requirements \nthat may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. \n\n7.5.2.  Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases \n\n92. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  describe  the  project  boundary  of  the  CP,  including  the \nphysical delineation of the CP using GPS coordinates as appropriate, and which sources, \nsinks  and  GHGs  are  included  in  the  project  boundary  in  accordance  with  the  applied \n\n19  As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to revise the PoA-DD in \norder to apply a mandatory standardized baseline that becomes available after the registration of the \nPoA and before a renewal of the PoA period. However, the activity cycle procedure also specifies that \nno  new  CPs  can  be  included  in  the  PoA  until  a  post-registration  change  to  the  PoA  to  reflect  the \nrequirements of the standardized baseline is approved by the Supervisory Body. \n\n25 of 56 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmethodologies and the applied standardized baselines, in accordance with the modalities \nin the generic CP as per paragraph 48 above. In this context, the project boundary is a \nphysical delineation or geographical area that encompasses GHGs and sources under the \ncontrol of the activity participants and that are significant and reasonably attributable to \nthe CP in accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable, the applied \nstandardized baselines. \n\n7.5.3.  Baseline scenario \n\n93. \n\n94. \n\nThe activity participants shall establish and describe the baseline scenario for the CP in \naccordance with the modalities in the generic CP as per paragraph 50 above. \n\nThe activity participants shall provide information on the facilities, systems and equipment \nto be operated under the CP and in the baseline scenario. \n\n95.  When  establishing  the  baseline  scenario,  if  the  activity  participants  foresee  that  future \nemissions  by  sources  are  projected  to  rise  above  current  levels  due  to  the  specific \ncircumstances of the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed demand in \nthe applied methodology if such option is envisaged in the generic CP in accordance with \nparagraph 51 above. \n\n96. \n\n97. \n\nIn case of replacement of existing equipment, the activity participants shall estimate the \npoint in time when the existing equipment would be replaced in the absence of the CP in \naccordance with the guidance on determining the remaining lifetime of equipment in the \napplied methodology if applicable. \n\nIf  the  CP  is  registered  under  or  covered  by  another  international,  regional,  national, \nsubnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the activity participants shall \napply  the  most  conservative  baseline  scenario  between  that  which  is  required  by  the \napplied  methodology  and  that  which  is  set  under  such  other  crediting  scheme  in \naccordance with guidance to be provided by the Supervisory Body. \n\n98. \n\nNotwithstanding  paragraphs  93−97  above,  if  the  CP  applies  an  approved  standardized \nbaseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the activity participants shall describe \nthe baseline scenario as per the applied standardized baseline. \n\n7.5.4.  Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark \n\n99. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  describe  the  BAU  scenario  or  reference  benchmark \nemissions for the proposed CP in accordance with the modalities of the generic CP-DD. \n\n7.5.5.  Demonstration of additionality \n\n100.  The activity participants shall demonstrate that the CP meets all conditions of the eligibility \ncriteria  referred  to  in  paragraph  72(i)  above  that  ensure  that  the  CP  meets  the \nrequirements  for  demonstration  of  additionality  in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of \napplied methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines. \n\n7.5.6.  Addressing  non-permanence  for  component  projects  involving  removals  and \n\nemission reduction component projects with reversal risks \n\n101.  For CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the activity \nparticipants shall, as per the modalities for inclusion of a CP in the A6.4 PoA, identify and \nassess the risks of reversals in the CP-DD, aligned with the provisions of the removals \n\n26 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nstandard  and  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents  approved  by  the \nSupervisory  Body,  and  conduct  the  risk  assessment  in  accordance  with  the  applied \nmethodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n102.  The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nActivity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity costs; \n\nRegulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks, \nacts of terrorism, crime and war; \n\nNatural  disturbances  and  extreme  events  such  as  fires,  pests,  droughts, \nhurricanes,  floods,  landslides,  earthquakes,  volcanic  eruptions,  and  geological \nfaults and fractures; \n\n(d) \n\nClimate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. \n\n103.  The risk assessment shall include: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA risk mitigation plan using the reversal risk assessment tool to be developed by \nthe Supervisory Body to identify, assess and mitigate reversal risks; and \n\nThe calculation of an overall percentage-based risk rating (hereinafter referred to \nas risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals, taking \ninto account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood and duration of the risks. \n\n104.  The risk assessment shall be reviewed and revised by activity participants every five years \nfrom the start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances referred to in \nparagraph 115 below. \n\n7.5.7.  Estimation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n105.  The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex post calculation of \nbaseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as GHG emission \nreductions  or  net  GHG  removals,  to  be  achieved  by  the  CP,  and  provide  the  ex-ante \ncalculation of them for each year of the crediting period, in accordance with the modalities \nin  the  generic  CP  as  per  paragraphs  54–58  above.  If  the  CP  contains  more  than  one \ncomponent,  the  activity  participants  shall  apply  this  requirement  for  each  component \nseparately. \n\n106.  The activity participants shall calculate, as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-\nDD, the difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the \ncrediting period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward \nadjustment based on BAU. \n\n107.  The  activity  participants  shall  determine  whether  the  baseline  must  be  adjusted \n\ndownwards as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD. \n\n108. \n\nIf  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  or  other  applied \nmethodological  regulatory  documents  include  different  scenarios  or  cases  or  provide \ndifferent options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify \ntheir  choice  in  accordance  with  the  modalities  in  the  generic  CP  as  per  paragraph  59 \nabove. \n\n27 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n109.  Activity participants shall identify the potential leakage sources, justify the exclusion of any \nsource and  identify  how  these sources are  avoided or  minimized  as  per  the  modalities \ncontained in the generic CP-DD.  \n\n110.  The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation \nof GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the CP is in accordance with the \ngeneric CP as described as per paragraph 62 above. \n\n7.5.8.  Monitoring plan \n\n111.  The  activity  participants  shall  develop  and  describe  a  monitoring  plan  for  the  CP  in \naccordance with the modalities in the generic CP as described as per paragraphs 64−69 \nabove. \n\n112.  For CPs involving removals, activity participants shall carry out the monitoring of removals \nbased on data derived from measurements, sampling, remote-sensing, third party sources \nand published literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and \ntake appropriate account of the associated uncertainties as per the modalities contained \nin the generic CP-DD. \n\n113.  The activity participants may choose to make a delayed submission of the monitoring plan, \nthat is after the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA and at any time prior to the \nsubmission of the request for issuance of A6.4 ERs that covers the first monitoring period \nof the CP. \n\n114. \n\nIf the activity participants choose to make a delayed submission of the monitoring plan in \naccordance  with  paragraph  113  above,  they  shall  clearly  state  in  the  CP-DD  that  the \nsubmission  of  the  monitoring  plan  is  delayed  and  therefore  the  CP-DD  submitted  for \ninclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA does not contain information related to the \nmonitoring plan. \n\n115.  For  CPs  involving  removals  and  for  emission  reduction  CPs  with  reversal  risks,  the \nmonitoring plan and the risk assessment plan of CPs included in a registered A6.4 PoA \nshall be reviewed and updated during the crediting period and verified by a DOE if: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan \nof  a  particular  CP/(s)  based  on  any  concerns  identified with  the  monitoring  plan \nand the risk assessment plan; \n\nAdditional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are \nnot adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan of \na particular CP/(s); \n\nThe  applicable  national  or  regional  regulations  require  the  consideration  of  risk \nfactors  that  are  not  included  or  are  not  adequately  addressed  in  the  monitoring \nplan and the risk assessment plan of a particular CP/(s). \n\n7.6. \n\n Start date, crediting period type and duration \n\n116.  The activity participants shall determine the start date of the CP as the date on which the \nactivity participants commit to making expenditures for the construction or modification of \nthe main equipment or facility (e.g. a wind turbine), or for the provision or modification of \na service (e.g. distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, change of transport management \nsystem)  under  the  CP.  Where  a  contract  is  signed  for  such  expenditures  (e.g.  for \n\n28 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nprocurement of a wind turbine), the start date is the date on which the contract is signed. \nIn other cases, it is the date on which such expenditures are incurred. If the CP involves \nmore than one of such contracts or incurred expenditures, the start date is the earliest of \nthe  respective  dates.  Activities  incurring  minor  pre-project  expenses  (e.g.  feasibility \nstudies, preliminary surveys) are not considered in the determination of the start date. \n\n117.  The start date of the proposed CP shall be both (i) on or after 1 January 2021, and (ii) on \nor after the start date of the PoA period as determined in accordance with paragraph 27 \nabove. \n\n118.  The activity participants shall specify the reference to the notification to the secretariat of \nthe intention for the CP to be included in a registered A6.4 PoA submitted in accordance \nwith the activity cycle procedure. \n\n119.  The activity participants shall specify the expected operational lifetime of the CP and adjust \nthe crediting period(s) accordingly in cases where the DNA has specified conditions that \nensure  that  the  total  length  of  the  crediting  period(s)  is  shorter  than  the  lifetime  of  the \ntechnology  implemented,  including  any  replacements  undertaken  during  the  crediting \nperiod. \n\n120.  The activity participants shall specify in the CP-DD the crediting period type (renewable or \nfixed),  start  date  and  duration  of  the  crediting  period  of  the  CP  consistent  with  the \nindication made in the generic CP as per paragraph 70 above. In this context, the start \ndate of the crediting period of the CP shall be on or after the date of inclusion of the CP in \nthe registered A6.4 PoA. \n\n121.  The activity participants shall state the start date of the crediting period of the CP in the \nformat  dd/mm/yyyy  and  shall  not  attach  any  qualifications  to  the  start  date,  such  as \n“expected”. \n\n122.  A CP that has been included in a registered A6.4 PoA may not be re-included in the same \nor different registered A6.4 PoA, or registered as an A6.4 project, after the expiry of its \nfinal crediting period. \n\n123.  The crediting period of a CP shall not exceed the end of the duration of the PoA, regardless \n\nof the crediting period type (renewable or fixed) of the CP. \n\n124.  The start date of the crediting period of a CP may be as early as 1 January 2021, but no \nlater  than  two  years  from  the  date  of  the  notification  of  inclusion  or  from  the  date  of \ninclusion of the CP in a registered PoA in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. \n\n7.7.  Environmental, social and sustainable development impacts \n\n125.  The activity participants shall carry out an assessment of the environmental, social and \nsustainable development impacts of the CP, and provide in the CP-DD a summary of the \nassessment  and  monitoring  plan  of  such  impacts  and  planned  remedial  measures  of \nnegative impacts, if any, during the implementation and operation of the CP in accordance \nwith the A6.4 SD Tool reflecting the generic CP requirements in this regard referred to in \nparagraph 72(m) above, and the filled-in forms required by the A6.4 SD Tool as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nProvide the identification, evaluation and avoidance of environmental and/or social \nrisks that may be caused by a proposed A6.4 activity in the A6.4 Environmental \nand social safeguards risk assessment form; \n\n29 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nProvide the relevant mitigation and minimization measures and monitoring to be \nimplemented in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form if there \nis  any  risk  identified  in  the  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk \nassessment form; \n\nProvide  the  evaluation  of  sustainable  development  impacts  and  the  measuring, \nmonitoring and reporting methodology in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact \nform. \n\n126. \n\n127. \n\nIn addition, if an environmental impact assessment and/or social impact assessment were \ncarried out for the CP as required by and in accordance with the relevant procedures of \nthe host Party, the activity participants shall provide all conclusions of such assessments \nand references to all related documentation reflecting the CP generic requirements in this \nregard referred to in paragraph 72(m) above. \n\nIf unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by activity participants or by the DOE \nduring  the  validation  for  inclusion  process,  that  exceed  the  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, \nactivity  participants  may  request  a  deviation  through  the  DOE  and  shall  revise  the \nrespective A6.4 SD Tool forms accordingly.  \n\n7.8. \n\nIntegrity safeguards \n\n128.

Where there are changes to the programme design of a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity \nparticipants shall prepare a revised PoA-DD that describes the nature and extent of the \nproposed or actual changes. \n\n148.  Changes to a registered A6.4 PoA may include: \n\n(a) \n\nChanges to the programme boundary to expand the geographical coverage or to \ninclude additional host Parties; \n\n(b) \n\nThe following revisions to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA: \n\n(i)  Revision  to  the  eligibility  criteria  due to  the  revision  or  replacement  of  the \n\napplied methodologies by the Supervisory Body;21 \n\n(ii)  Addition  or  change  of  technologies/measures  with  or  without  addition  or \nchange  of  applied  methodologies  in  the  registered  PoA-DD  as  referred  in \nsubparagraph (f) below. \n\n(iii)  Revision  to  the  eligibility  criteria  pertaining  to  the  demonstration  of \n\nadditionality; \n\nRemoval  of  applied  methodologies  and/or  standardized  baselines  from  the \nregistered PoA-DD; \n\nChanges to the capacity22 range specified in the registered PoA-DD; \n\nAny change of programme design; \n\nAdding  new  components  or  extending/adding  technologies/measures,  provided \nthat  they  comply  with  the  types  of  Article  6.4  activity  that  the  host  Party  would \napprove in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs, that introduce: \n\n(i)  Complementary  technologies/measures  involving  mass  and/or  energy \ntransfer  to/from  the  technologies/measures  specified  in  the  originally \nregistered PoA-DD;23 or \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n21  As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to apply a revised version \nof the methodology that is different from the version applied for the registration of the PoA. However, the \nactivity  cycle  procedure  also  specifies  that  no  new  CPs  can  be  included  in  the  PoA  until  a  post-\nregistration  change  to  the  PoA  to  reflect  the  requirements  of  the  new  version  of  the  methodology  is \napproved by the Supervisory Body. \n\n22  Installed/rated capacity of technologies and/or measures that directly impacts emission reductions or net \n\nremovals. \n\n23  Examples include: \n\n(a)  A landfill gas capture and electricity generation activity using three electricity generating units adds \nan additional electricity generating unit without altering the quantity of landfill gas extracted (i.e. the \ncapacity of the landfill gas extraction system remained the same); \n\n(b)  Addition of a back-up electricity generating source to supply electricity during exigencies when the \n\nproject fails to meet the demand or is not available due to operational reasons. \n\n34 of 56 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(ii)  More advanced version of the same technologies as per the definition of “the \nsame technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above (e.g. improved performance in \nGHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals,  efficiency,  health,  safety \nand durability evidenced in reference to a relevant national or international \nstandard);24 \n\nRemoving  a component or  technology/measure  specified  in the  registered PoA-\nDD; \n\nthe \n\nsame \nChanging \ntechnologies/measures as the technologies/measures in the originally registered \nPDD as per the definition of “the same technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above;25 \n\ntechnologies/measures \n\nresult \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nAny  consequential  changes  to  the  application  of  methodologies,  standardized \nbaselines  and/or  other  methodological  regulatory  documents  resulting  from  the \nchanges  referred  to  in  subparagraphs  (a)−(h)  above,  including  changes  to  or \naddition  of  other  methodologies,  other  standardized  baselines  and/or  other \nmethodological regulatory documents, or application of a baseline scenario that is \nmore appropriate as a result of the modifications to the PoA; \n\nVoluntarily updating the applied methodologies or the other applied methodological \nregulatory  documents to  a  later valid  version  of  them,  or  voluntarily  changing  to \nthe  updated/changed \nother  methodologies,  provided  all  requirements \nmethodologies  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents  are \nmet; \n\nin \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n(j) \n\n(k) \n\nRevision of generic CP to: \n\n(i) \n\nApply an applicable and valid standardized baseline to determine baseline \nemissions or parameter values; \n\n(ii)  Switch from an ex post to an ex ante determination of parameter values for \ncalculating baseline emissions using a standardized baseline, subject to the \nprovisions and conditions set out in paragraph 186 below. \n\n149. \n\nIf the change to a registered A6.4 PoA is to include an additional host Party as referred to \nin  paragraph  148(a)  above,  the  new  host  Party  shall  approve  the  PoA  as  per  the \nrequirements in the activity cycle procedure. \n\n150.  For  any  post-registration  changes  to  the  PoA  that  may  result  in  an  increase  in  the \nmaximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to \nbe  achieved  that  was  previously  approved  by  the  host  Party,  an  approval  of  the  post-\nregistration changes by the respective host Party is required as per the requirements of \nthe activity cycle procedure. \n\n151.  For  the  cases  of  revisions  of  the  eligibility  criteria  that  are  not  referred  to  in  paragraph \n148(b) above, the activity participants shall seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on \nthe appropriateness of the revision in accordance with the “Procedure: Consideration of \nunsolicited letters to the Supervisory Body”. \n\n24  Examples  include a  project disseminating lamps  with  a useful life of two years changing to  distribute \n\nlamps with a useful life of seven years. \n\n25  Examples include changing the mode of utilization of recovered methane from a landfill, such as shifting \n\nfrom flaring to heat generation or from heat generation to electricity generation. \n\n35 of 56 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n152.

The  activity \nparticipants shall provide information on how data and parameters have been monitored. \n\n184.  For each parameter, the activity participants shall: \n\n(a) \n\nProvide the values of the monitored parameter for the purpose of calculating GHG \nemission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals.  Where  data  are  measured \n\n43 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\ncontinuously,  they  shall  be  presented  using  an  appropriate  time  interval.  For  a \ndefault value that is not fixed at the time of the registration of the A6.4 PoA or the \ninclusion of the CPs, the most recent value shall be applied; \n\nDescribe  the  equipment  used  to  monitor  each  parameter,  including  details  on \naccuracy class, and calibration information (i.e. frequency, date of calibration and \nvalidity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan; \n\nDescribe  how  the  parameter  is  measured/calculated  and  the  measurement  and \nrecording frequency; \n\nProvide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g. logbooks, daily records, surveys); \n\nProvide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant; \n\nDescribe  the  QA/QC  procedures  applied,  if  applicable,  as  per  the  registered \nmonitoring plan; \n\nProvide information about appropriate emission factor, IPCC default value and any \nother reference value. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n185. \n\nIf  data  and  parameters  monitored  are  determined  by  a  sampling  approach,  the  activity \nparticipants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance with the \nsampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan. \n\n186.  For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a \nchoice  between  an  ex  ante  and  an  ex  post  determination  of  parameter  values  for \ncalculating baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals for a generic CP and that chose \nthe ex ante determination, or that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring \na determination of these values ex ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline \nvalid at the time of the submission of the request for registration of the PoA for this purpose \nto  the  generic  CP,  the  activity  participants  shall  apply  the  version  of  the  standardized \nbaseline  valid  at  the  time  of  the  inclusion  of  a  corresponding  CP  for  the  purpose  of \nmonitoring the CP until the end of the first crediting period of the CP. If no valid version of \nthe  applied  standardized  baseline  is  available  at  the  time  of  the  inclusion  of  a \ncorresponding  CP  despite  the  fact  that  the  corresponding  generic  CP  applied  the \nstandardized baseline, the activity participants shall calculate baseline GHG emissions or \nnet  GHG  removals,  or  parameter  values  in  accordance  with  the  applied  methodology \nand/or applicable methodological tool and apply them to the CP until the end of its first \ncrediting period of the CP. \n\n187.  For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a \nchoice  between  an  ex  ante  and  an  ex  post  determination  of  parameter  values  for \ncalculating  baseline  GHG  emissions  or  net  GHG  removals  and  that  chose  the  ex  post \ndetermination where there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of \nregistration of the PoA, the activity participants may, at any time during the first PoA period, \nswitch  to  the  ex  ante  determination  by  applying  to  the  generic  CP  an  applicable \nstandardized baseline that becomes available after the registration of the PoA and is valid \nat the time of the switch. For all corresponding CPs that have been included before the \nswitch, the activity participants shall switch to the ex ante determination by applying the \nstandardized  baseline  as  per  the  revised  generic  CP.  After  the  switch,  for  all  new \ncorresponding  CPs,  the  activity  participants  shall  apply  the  version  of  the  standardized \nbaseline  valid  at  the  time  of  their  inclusion  or,  if  no  valid  version  of  the  standardized \nbaseline is available at the time of their inclusion, the activity participants shall calculate \n\n44 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthese  values \nthe  applied  methodology  and/or  applicable \nmethodological tool for the CPs. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline \nshall undergo the post-registration change approval process for the PoA, and the switch \nof all included CPs to the ex ante determination shall undergo post-registration change \nnotification process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. \n\n188.  For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a \nchoice between an ex ante and ex post determination of parameter values for calculating \nbaseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals to generic CPs, the activity participants \nshall, at each renewal of the PoA period, choose the ex ante or ex post determination of \nparameter  values  for  each  generic  CP  individually,  unless  otherwise  required  by  the \napplied methodology or methodological tool, and shall follow the same rules in terms of \nthe use and validity of standardized baselines as in paragraphs 186 and 187 above. \n\n189.  Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan \nform,  if  applicable,  and  the  A6.4  Sustainable  development  impact  form  containing  all \nparameters  used  to  monitor  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  the  sustainable \ndevelopment  impacts  for  each  CP  included  in  the  batch  of  requests  for  issuance  and \nexplaining  how  any  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  have  been  assessed, \nmitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in the registered CP-DD. \n\n190. \n\nIf unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the \nDOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements \nand criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants \nmay request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4 \nSD Tool forms accordingly. \n\n191.  For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the \nmonitoring report for each CP included in the batch of requests for issuance as part of the \ninvestment analysis. \n\n9.7.  Calculation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n192.  The  activity  participants  shall,  for  each  of  the  included  CPs  for  the  monitoring  period, \nidentify the formulae used for the calculations of, and provide calculation results of, the \nfollowing: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nBaseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals; \n\nProject GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals; \n\nLeakage GHG emissions; \n\nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals . \n\n193.  Where the batch/group of CPs includes CPs involving removals that also result in emission \nreductions,  the  accounting  of  removals  and  emission  reductions  shall  be  separated  for \neach CP in the monitoring report in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the \nactivity. \n\n194.  The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals achieved by the included CPs with the estimates in the registered CP-\nDDs. The activity participants shall ensure that the sum of the amount of GHG emission \nreductions  or  net GHG  removals  requested for  issuance  and  the  cumulative  amount  of \nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals already issued for the PoA are up to the \n\n45 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmaximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by \nthe host Party; otherwise a post-registration change to the PoA shall be approved by the \nhost  Party  and the  Supervisory  Body  as  per  the respective  requirements of the  activity \ncycle procedure, prior to requesting issuance.  \n\n195.  For any included CP, the activity participants shall explain the cause of any increase in \nthe actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the monitoring \nperiod (e.g. higher water availability, higher plant load factor), including all information (i.e. \ndata and/or parameters) that is different from what is stated in the CP-DD. \n\n10.  Renewal  of  programme  of  activities  and  component \n\nprojects \n\n10.1.  Renewal of programme of activities period \n\n196.  The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA shall renew the PoA period every five \nyears (every 15 years for the registered PoAs involving removals) counting from the start \ndate of the first PoA period as determined in accordance with paragraph 27 above. \n\n197.  The PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA may be renewed if the host Party has approved \nthe renewal when approving the PoA prior to its registration in accordance with the activity \ncycle procedure. \n\n198.  To support a request for renewal of the PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity \nparticipants  shall,  using  the  valid  version  of  the  applicable  PoA-DD  form,  update  the \nrelevant sections of the PoA-DD of the PoA including the eligibility criteria for inclusion of \nCPs in the PoA and for demonstrating additionality, and modalities for setting the baseline \nand for preparing the monitoring plan and the new PoA period. \n\n199.  When updating the PoA-DD and its generic components, activity participants shall apply \n\nmethodologies in one of the following manners: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  use  the  valid  version  of  the  methodologies  and \nmethodological tools applied in the registered PoA-DD; that is, the latest version at \nthe  time  of  the  submission  of  the  request  for  renewal  of  the  PoA  period  or  the \nprevious version if the submission of the request is still within the grace period of \nthe previous version for use;30 \n\nIf any of the methodologies applied in the registered PoA-DD was withdrawn after \nthe registration of the PoA and was replaced by consolidated methodologies, the \nactivity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies; \nor \n\nIf  the  PoA  does  not  meet  the  applicability  conditions  of  the  methodologies  or \nmethodological tools under the options in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above due to \ntheir revisions or due to the update of the baseline, the activity participants shall \neither: \n\n(i) \n\nSelect other applicable approved methodologies; or \n\n30  Referred  to  in  the  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of  methodologies  and \n\nmethodological tools”. \n\n46 of 56 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(ii)  Request,  under  the  clarification  process  in  the  “Procedure:  Development, \nrevision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”, either \nthrough the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the PoA period or by \nthemselves,  to  clarify  whether  a  deviation  from  the  valid  version  of  the \nmethodologies  (including  consolidated  methodologies  thereof)  or  the \nmethodological  tools  applied  in  the  registered  PoA-DD,  or  from  any  other \nselected  methodologies  or  any  other  methodological  tools  applied  in \naccordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable. \n\n200. \n\nIn updating the PoA-DD of the registered A6.4 PoA in accordance with paragraphs 198 \nand  199  above,  the  activity  participants  shall  consider  the  application  of  an  approved \nstandardized baseline to the PoA as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nThe activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved  standardized \nbaseline if: \n\n(i) \n\nThe standardized baseline is applied in the registered PoA-DD and the valid \nversion of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the PoA and to the \nmethodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 198 above; or \n\n(ii)  The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PoA-DD but the \nvalid version of the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory31 is \napplicable to the PoA and to the methodologies applied in accordance with \nparagraph  198  above.  However,  the  activity  participants  may  update  the \nPoA-DD  without  selecting such  standardized  baseline  if  the  submission  of \nthe request for renewal of the PoA period is made within 240 days after the \nstandardized baseline became valid; \n\n(b) \n\nIf the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PoA-DD \nis no longer applicable to the PoA and/or to the valid version of the methodologies \napplied in the registered PoA-DD due to a revision of the standardized baseline \nafter the registration of the PoA, the activity participants shall: \n\n(i) \n\nSelect another applicable approved standardized baseline; or \n\n(ii)  Use  only  the  valid  version  of  the  methodologies  applied  in  the  registered \nPoA-DD  that  are  still  applicable  to  the  PoA  and  that  can  be  used \nindependently for estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals \nwithout using the standardized baseline applied in the registered PoA-DD; \n\n(c) \n\nThe  activity  participants  may  use  the  valid  version  of  an  applicable  approved \nstandardized baseline if: \n\n(i) \n\nThe standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PoA-DD;  \n\n(ii)  The  standardized  baseline  does  not  require  its  mandatory  selection  but  is \napplicable to the PoA and to the methodologies applied in accordance with \nparagraph 198 above. \n\n201.  The activity participants shall demonstrate that the modalities for setting the baseline or \nupdating it for each of the corresponding CPs is in accordance with paragraphs 202−203 \nbelow. \n\n31  For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 19. \n\n47 of 56 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n202.  When defining the modalities for setting the baseline or updating it, the activity participants \nshall  take  into  account  the  requirements  of  the  applied  methodologies,  standardized \nbaselines, and other methodological regulatory documents. \n\n203. \n\nIf data and parameters used for determining the original baseline were determined ex ante \nand not monitored during the PoA period and are no longer valid, the activity participants \nshall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be provided \nby the Supervisory Body. \n\n204.  The result of the process described in paragraphs 198–203 above defines a new version \n\nof the PoA-DD, including its generic CP-DD part. \n\n205.  The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up-to-date. \n\n206. \n\nIf the activity participants plan to make, or have made, a post-registration change to the \nprogramme design effective from the start date of the new PoA period, they shall clearly \nindicate the post-registration change in the new version of the PoA-DD, distinguishing the \npost-registration  change  from  other  updates  of  information  due  to  renewal  of  the  PoA \nperiod. \n\n10.2.  Renewal of crediting period of component projects \n\n207.  To renew the crediting period of an included CP, the activity participants shall, using the \nvalid  version  of  the  applicable  CP-DD  form,  update  the  sections  of  the  CP-DD  in \naccordance with the latest version of the applicable generic component of the PoA-DD, \nrelating to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe  baseline  emissions,  including  updating  the  downward  adjustment  as  per \nparagraphs 56 and 57 above; \n\nThe  BAU  scenario  and  emissions,  and  the  difference  between  the  baseline \nemissions  and  BAU  emissions  as  annual  and  total  amounts  with  respect  to  the \ncrediting period to be renewed; \n\nThe estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable); \n\nThe monitoring plan (if applicable); \n\nThe A6.4 SD Tool forms; \n\nThe  risk  assessment  and  monitoring  plan  for  CPs  involving  removals  and  for \nemission reduction CPs with reversal risks; \n\n(g) \n\nThe crediting period. \n\n208.  To  demonstrate  the  validity  of  the  CP’s  original  baseline  or  its  update,  the  activity \nparticipants  shall  take  into  account  the  requirements  of  the  applied  methodologies, \nstandardized baselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents as per \nthe modalities contained in the generic CP-DD. \n\n209. \n\nIf data and parameters used for determining the original baseline, which were determined \nex ante and were not monitored during the crediting period, are no longer valid, the activity \nparticipants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be \nprovided by the Supervisory Body. \n\n48 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n11.  Post-crediting monitoring and reporting \n\n210.  For all CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, activity \nparticipants  shall  continue  monitoring  the  CPs  after  the  end  of  the  last  active  crediting \nperiod to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nAssess whether any reversals have occurred; \n\nQuantify the amount of reversals; and \n\nConfirm the continued storage of the GHGs. \n\n211.  Activity  participants  may  terminate  the  post-crediting  monitoring  of  CPs  included  in  a \nregistered  A6.4  PoA,  subject  to  approval  by  the  Supervisory  Body,  if  they  can \ndemonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable information, that: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe stored GHGs in the CPs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or \n\nThe  potential  future  reversals  for  CPs  are  remediated  in  accordance  with  the \nprovisions of the relevant section of the removals standard  (i.e., Remediation of \nreversals). \n\n12.  Voluntary  exclusion  and  re-inclusion  of  component \n\nprojects \n\n12.1.  Voluntary exclusion of component projects \n\n212.  At any time after the inclusion of a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity participants \nmay request the secretariat to exclude the CP from the PoA in accordance with the activity \ncycle procedure. \n\n213.  A CP that has been voluntarily excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA or excluded due to \nerroneous inclusion may be re-included in the same or different registered A6.4 PoA in \naccordance with section 12.2 below or registered as an A6.4 project in accordance with \nthe relevant provisions in the \"Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”. \n\n12.2.  Re-inclusion of excluded component projects \n\n214.  The activity participants wishing to re-include an excluded CP in a registered A6.4 PoA \nshall follow the process for inclusion of CPs in a registered A6.4 PoA in accordance with \nthe activity cycle procedure after ensuring that: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe CP-DD transparently declares that the CP has been previously excluded from \nthe same or different registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to erroneous \ninclusion; \n\nThe crediting period type (i.e. renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting \nperiod are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of \nthe exclusion, noting that A6.4ERs may be claimed for the period only from or after \nthe date of re-inclusion, and: \n\n(i) \n\nIf  the  crediting  period  type  is  renewable,  the  updated  CP-DD  shall  be \nuploaded  by  the  validating  DOE  within  one  year  of  the  end  date  of  the \n\n49 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\ncrediting  period  valid  for  the  CP  at  the  time  of  the  exclusion,  noting  that \nmissing the deadline no longer allows the uploading of the updated CP-DD; \n\n(ii) \n\nIf the crediting period type is fixed, the updated CP-DD shall be uploaded by \nthe validating DOE prior to the end date of the crediting period valid for the \nCP at the time of the exclusion, noting that missing the deadline no longer \nallows the uploading of the updated CP-DD; \n\nIf the crediting period type is renewable and the re-inclusion takes place after the \nend of the crediting period in which the exclusion occurred, the CP complies with \nthe generic CP, including the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA, and \nrelevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements; \n\nIf the CP applies a methodology that potentially accrues negative GHG emission \nreductions,  GHG  emission  reductions  have  been  continuously  monitored  in \naccordance with the registered monitoring plan and verified by a DOE since the \nend  of  the  monitoring  period  in  the  last  published  monitoring  report  for  the  CP, \nincluding  the  exclusion  period.  For  such  CP,  if  there  were  net  negative  GHG \nemission reductions during the period before the re-inclusion, the amount shall be \ndeducted from the first requests for issuance of A6.4 ERs covering that CP after \nthe re-inclusion; \n\nIf  the  CP  has  been  excluded  as  a  result  of  erroneous  inclusion  and  to  be  re-\nincluded in the same PoA, the non-compliance with the requirements for inclusion \nin the PoA that led to the erroneous inclusion has been rectified, and, if A6.4 ERs \nhave  been  issued  for  the  CP,  an  equivalent  amount  of  A6.4ERs  have  been \ncompensated  by  the  DOE  that  included  the  CP,  to  the  mechanism  registry  in \naccordance with the activity cycle procedure. \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n50 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nAppendix 1.

Modalities of local stakeholder consultation \n\n1. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n2. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n3. \n\n7. \n\nScope and target of consultation \n\nThe  scope  of  the  local  or  subnational  stakeholder  consultation  (hereinafter  collectively \nreferred to as local stakeholder consultation) shall comprise, as a minimum, the potential \ndirect positive and negative impacts that the proposed component projects (CPs) that may \nbe included in a registered programme of activities under the mechanism established by \nArticle 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (A6.4 PoA) may have. \n\nThe local stakeholder consultation of  proposed CPs shall be conducted for each CP. If \nmore  than  one  CP  is  located  in  the  same  or  close  geographical  location(s),  one  local \nstakeholder  consultation  may  cover  multiple  CPs.  In  this  case,  the  activity  participants \nshall provide appropriate justification. \n\nThe activity participants shall invite, as a minimum, representatives of local stakeholders \ndirectly  impacted  by  the  proposed  CP,  including  local  communities  and  Indigenous \nPeoples, as applicable, and representatives of local authorities relevant to the CP. \n\nThe activity participants shall provide evidence that invitations were sent to the relevant \nstakeholders  and  that  their  comments  were  invited.  If  any  of  the  relevant  stakeholders \nwere not invited, the activity participants shall provide appropriate justification. \n\nTiming of consultation \n\nThe activity participants shall complete the local stakeholder consultation process at the \ntiming  required  by the rules of  the  host  Party  on local  stakeholder  consultation,  if  such \nrules exist. If such host Party rules do not exist, the activity participants shall complete the \nprocess before, whichever the earlier of: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe start date of the CP as defined in paragraphs 116−117 of the main part of this \nstandard; or \n\nThe  date  of  submitting  the  component  project  design  document  (CP-DD)  of  the \nproposed CP to a designated operational entity (DOE) for validation. \n\nFor CPs that do not meet the requirement referred to in paragraph 5 above, the activity \nparticipants may submit a request for exemption from the requirement to the Supervisory \nBody of the Article 6.4 mechanism for its consideration on a case-by-case basis. \n\nConduct of consultation \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  invite  local  stakeholders  to  provide  comments  on  the \nproposed CP in an open and transparent manner, in a way that facilitates comments to be \nreceived  from  local  stakeholders  and  allows  for  a  reasonable  time for  comments  to  be \nsubmitted.  The  activity  participants  shall  describe  the  steps/actions  taken  to  invite \ncomments, taking into account local and national circumstances. \n\n8. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  convey  information  to  stakeholders  about  the  local \nstakeholder  consultation  and  the  proposed  CP  in  ways  that  are  appropriate  for  the \n\n52 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\ncommunity that is directly affected by the project. In areas where a significant part of the \npopulation is illiterate, the information shall be provided orally. \n\n9. \n\nThe activity participants shall describe the proposed CP(s) in a manner that allows local \nstakeholders  to  understand  the  project.  The  information  to  be  made  available  to  local \nstakeholders shall include, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nA  summary  of  the  proposed  CP,  explaining  the  project  in  simple,  non-technical \nterms, and containing a description of the direct positive and negative impacts; \n\nInformation  on  the  projected  scope,  lifetime  and  direct  positive  and  negative \nimpacts of the proposed CP; \n\nA summary of the analysis of the environmental and social impacts and sustainable \ndevelopment benefits of the proposed CP and the three completed A6.4 SD Tool \nforms; \n\ninto  account \nOther  relevant \nconfidentiality  provisions  referred  to  in  paragraph  9(e)  of  the  main  part  of  this \nstandard; \n\nthe  proposed  CP, \n\ninformation  about \n\ntaking \n\n(e) \n\nThe means to provide comments about the proposed CP. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\nThe activity participants shall conduct the local stakeholder consultation through means \nthat are appropriate for the local and national circumstances. \n\nThe activity participants shall provide local stakeholders with the opportunity to comment, \nin writing or via other means and gather their comments about the proposed CP and its \ndirect impacts. \n\nThe activity participants shall request the designated national authority (DNA) of the host \nParty  to  forward  any  comments  from  local  stakeholders  submitted  to  the  host  Party  to \nthem. \n\nThe activity participants shall prepare a summary report of the comments received from \nlocal stakeholders. \n\nThe activity participants shall consider the comments provided by local stakeholders and \nreport in the CP-DD on how they have taken them into account. The activity participants \nshall provide justification if any comments were not incorporated. \n\n4. \n\nActivities after consultation \n\n15. \n\nAfter the completion of the local stakeholder consultation, local stakeholders may submit \na  complaint  to  the  DNA  of  the  host  Party  if  they  find  that  the  outcome  of  the  local \nstakeholder consultation is not appropriately taken into account. The DOE shall request \nthe DNA to forward such complaints, if any, to the DOE and promptly forward them to the \nactivity participants during the validation in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and \nverification standard for programmes of activities”. \n\n16. \n\nIf, during the validation of the proposed CP, complaints submitted to the DNA of the host \nParty on the handling of the outcome of the local stakeholder consultation are forwarded \nto the activity participants through the DOE, the activity participants shall take due account \n\n53 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nof such complaints and modify the CP-DD as appropriate before the DOE concludes the \nvalidation.\n\n54 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nAppendix 3. \n\nInstructions  for  the  consideration  of  cross \neffects \nthe  application  of  multiple \nmethodologies for programme of activities \n\nfor \n\n215.  These  instructions  are  applicable  to  a  programme  of  activity  (PoA)  seeking  to  apply \nmultiple technologies/measures under the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph \n4, of the Paris Agreement. \n\n216.  Cross-effects may occur when multiple technologies/measures are implemented, applying \n\neither one methodology or multiple methodologies. \n\n217. \n\nIf a single methodology is consistently applied in each component project (CP) in a PoA \nbut  using  multiple  technologies/measures,  it  may  potentially  lead  to  over-estimation  of \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions when several technologies/measures interact \nwith each other. The cross-effects in such situations shall be addressed through additional \nguidance related to the application of the methodology for a PoA contained in the applied \nmethodology. \n\n218.  The  activity  participants  shall  consider  the  following  situations  to  identify  cross-effects. \nThese situations are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive and are intended to serve \nas examples only: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nType I: Cross-effects could occur when there is an exchange of energy (thermal, \nmechanical or electrical) or mass transfer between different measures within a CP \nor between CPs, where the transfer occurs from a primary or independent measure \nto a dependent measure; \n\nType  II:  Cross-effects  could  occur  when  several  measures  rely  on  the  same \ninformation  when  estimating  GHG  emission  reductions.  For  example,  several \nmeasures refer to historical fuel/electricity/heat consumption or a default value. \n\n219.  The activity participants shall consider that, when combining different types of measures, \n(e.g.  energy  efficiency  and  fuel  switch),  the  baselines  for  different  measures  shall  be \ndetermined  sequentially  and  not  simultaneously.  The  baseline  of \nthe  second \ntechnology/measure shall be set after considering the effects of the implementation of the \nfirst technology/measure: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nFor Type I cross-effects, the energy/mass stream of the dependent measure shall \nbe  determined  conservatively,  taking  into  account  the  output  of  the  primary \nmeasure; \n\nFor Type II cross-effects, once a baseline is estimated/determined, the secondary \n(tertiary, etc.) measure shall not use the historical/default values, but an adjusted \nvalue taking into account a scenario in which the primary measure is implemented. \n\n- - - - - \n\n55 of 56 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-004 \nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nVersion \n\nDate \n\nDescription \n\nDocument information \n\n02.0 \n\n16 May 2025 \n\n01.0 \n\n18 July 2024 \n\nSBM 016, Annex 7. \nRevision to incorporate CMA guidance, align with methodological \nstandards (Methodologies, Additionality and Removals), the SD \ntool and provisions on authorization. \nSBM 013, Annex 3. \n\nInitial adoption. \n\nDecision Class: Regulatory \nDocument Type: Standard \nBusiness Function: A6.4 activity cycle \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, A6.4 programme of activities, activity standard, component project \n\n56 of 56 \n\n  \n \n \n\f"}, {"url": "https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-005.pdf", "title": "Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities", "text": "ARTICLE 6.4 MECHANISM \n\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \n\nStandard \n\nArticle 6.4 validation and verification \nstandard for programmes of activities \n\nVersion 02.0 \n\n \n \n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nPage \n\n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................  \n\n1.1. \n\nBackground ....................................................................................................  \n\n1.2.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) \nfor  the  mechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop \nprovisions  for  the  development  and  approval  of  methodologies,  validation,  registration, \nmonitoring,  verification  and  certification,  issuance,  renewal,  first  transfer  from  the \nmechanism  registry,  voluntary  cancellation  and  other  processes  pursuant  to  chapters \nV.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  fourth  session,  elaborated some  elements  of  the  RMPs relating  to the \noperation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body, at  its thirteenth meeting,  adopted  the  “Article  6.4  validation  and \nverification standard for programmes of activities” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) \nthat  sets  out  the  requirements  relating  to  validation  and  verification  for  Article  6.4 \nmechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and component projects (CPs). \n\nThe Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the \nrequirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and  assessment  of \nArticle  6.4  mechanism  methodologies”4  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  methodologies \nstandard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article \n6.4 mechanism”5 (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article \n6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two \nstandards  set  out  the  requirements  for  the  development  and  assessment  of  Article  6.4 \nmechanism  methodologies  and  the  requirements  for  activities  involving  removals  and \nemission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas \nthe A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have \nmet the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental \nrisks,  as  well  as  for  assessing  and  enhancing  the  contributions  of  A6.4  activities  to \nsustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of \nthe host Party and the sustainable development  goals (SDGs). \n\n1.2.  Objectives \n\n5. \n\nThe  objective  of  this  standard  is  to  set  out  requirements  relating  to  validation  and \nverification  for  Article  6.4  mechanism  programmes  of  activities  (A6.4  PoAs)  and \ncomponent projects (CPs) that may be included in registered A6.4 PoAs. \n\n1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Standard auditing techniques \n\n23. \n\nThe DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. \n\n24. \n\nIn  assessing  the  information,  the  DOE  shall  apply  the  means  of  validation  specified \nthroughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including, \nbut not limited to: \n\n(a) \n\nDocument review, involving: \n\n(i) \n\nA review of data and information; \n\n(ii)  Cross-checks  between  the  information  provided  in  the  PoA-DD  and \ninformation  from  sources  other  than  those  used  to  determine  whether  the \ninformation in the PoA-DD is reliable; if available, the DOE’s sectoral or local \nexpertise; and, if necessary, independent background investigations; \n\n9  All types of validation report forms are available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n10  All types of verification and certification report forms are available on the UNFCCC website. \n\n11 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(b) \n\nFollow-up  actions  (e.g.  on-site  inspection  and  telephone  or  e-mail  interviews), \nincluding: \n\n(i) \n\nInterviews with relevant stakeholders in the host country, such as personnel \nwith knowledge of the A6.4 PoA design and implementation; \n\n(ii)  Cross-checks  between  the  information  provided  by  interviewed  personnel \n(i.e.  by  checking  sources  or  other  interviews)  to  ensure  that  no  relevant \ninformation has been omitted; \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nReference \ntechnologies similar to the proposed A6.4 PoA or CP under validation; \n\ninformation  relating \n\nto  available \n\nto  programmes,  projects  or \n\nReview,  based  on  the  selected  methodologies,  the  selected  standardized \nbaselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents,  of  the \nappropriateness of formulae and accuracy of calculations; \n\nSampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for \nA6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. \n\n25. \n\nIt is optional for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection for validation for the registration \nof a proposed A6.4 PoA. If the DOE conducts an on-site inspection, it does not necessarily \nneed  to  include  a  visit  to  the  geographical  locations  where  CPs  will  be  or  are  being \nimplemented,  but  the  inspection  could  be  to  the  office  of  the  representative  activity \nparticipants. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site inspection as a means of validation, \nit  shall  describe  the  alternative  means  used  and  justify  that  they  are  sufficient  for  the \npurpose of validation. \n\n26.  Where  no  specific  means  of  validation  are  specified,  the  DOE  shall  apply  the  standard \n\nauditing techniques described in paragraph 24 above. \n\n6.1.3.  Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests \n\n27. \n\nIf the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order \nto determine whether the proposed A6.4 PoA meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism \nrules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues are accurately identified, \nformulated, discussed and concluded in the validation report. \n\n28. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  raise  a  corrective  action  request  (CAR)  if  one  or  more  of  the  following \nsituations occurs: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nMistakes have been made by the activity participants that will influence the ability \nof the proposed A6.4 PoA to achieve real, measurable, verifiable and additional \nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\nThe applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have not been met; \nor \n\nThere  is  a  risk  that  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  cannot  be \nmonitored or calculated. \n\n29. \n\nThe DOE shall raise a clarification request (CL) if the information provided by the activity \nparticipants is insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article \n6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have been met. \n\n12 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n30. \n\n31. \n\n32. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  raise  a  forward  action  request  (FAR)  if  issues  related  to  programme \nimplementation that require review  during the first  verification  after the  validation  of the \nproposed A6.4 PoA are identified. The DOE shall not raise a FAR that relates to the Article \n6.4 mechanism rules and requirements for registration of the PoA. \n\nThe DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify \nthe PoA design and/or the PoA-DD, or provide additional explanations or evidence that \nsatisfy  the  DOE’s  concerns.  If  this  is  not  done,  the  DOE  shall  not  submit  a  request  for \nregistration of the proposed A6.4 PoA. \n\nThe DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its validation report. This reporting \nshall  explain  the  issues  raised,  the  responses  provided  by  the  activity  participants,  the \nmeans  of  validation  of  such responses,  and  references  to  any resulting changes in  the \nPoA-DD or its supporting documents. \n\n6.2.

The DOE shall \nconduct an assessment to ensure that the request is not submitted with the intention of \nrevising the selected methodology, methodological tool and/or standardized baseline to \nexpand their applicability. \n\n12  Examples of PoA-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n(a)  The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a \ncertain method. The  activity participants of the  proposed  PoA  identify a  difficulty in acquiring  the \nspecified instrumentation or difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however, they can \nachieve  comparable  accuracy  of  measured  parameters  using  an  alternative  instrumentation  or \nmeasurement method; \n\n(b)  A proposed CP does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology for a certain \nparameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the CP to estimate the parameter with \nequal reliability and accuracy; \n\n(c)  A minor deviation is sought for a PoA-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative. For \nexample: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5% of rated \ncapacity,  if  the  historical  baseline  is  to  be  applied.  Due  to  government  restrictions,  the  plant  has \nnever been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated capacity \n(20% below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying conservative approaches \nto calculate the emission reduction in such a PoA-specific case; \n\n(d)  A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to \nprogramme-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology.

Application of methodologies and standardized baselines \n\n6.3.3.1. \n\nGeneral \n\n76. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  validate  that  the  selected  methodologies,  the  selected  standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are applicable to \nthe design of the proposed generic CP and that the selected versions are valid at the time \nof  submission  of  the  proposed  A6.4  PoA  for  registration  and,  if  applicable,  are  in \ncompliance with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party \nin accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. \n\n77. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized \nbaselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents  were  correctly \napplied with respect to the following: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nApplicability conditions; \n\nProject boundary; \n\nBaseline identification; \n\nAlgorithms and/or formulae used to determine emission reductions; \n\nAdditionality; \n\nMonitoring methodology. \n\n78. \n\n79. \n\n80. \n\n81. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are correctly quoted \nand  applied  by  comparing  them  with  the  actual  text  of  the  valid  version  of  these \ndocuments, and relevant requirements in the activity standard. \n\nIf the generic CP applies a previous version of a methodology or a standardized baseline \nbut the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA is likely to be submitted after the \ngrace period for applying the previous version in accordance with the validity section of \nthe  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of  methodologies  and \nmethodological tools”, the DOE shall request the activity participants to provide a revised \nPoA-DD,  applying  the  latest  version  of  the  methodology  or  other  applicable  and  valid \nmethodology, or the standardized baseline in accordance with the activity standard. \n\nIf the generic CP does not apply a standardized baseline but the request for registration \nof  the  proposed  A6.4  PoA  is  likely  to  be  submitted  after  an  applicable  approved \nstandardized baseline whose selection is mandatory has become valid and after the grace \nperiod for not applying the standardized baseline in accordance with the validity section of \nthe  “Procedure:  Development,  revision,  clarification  and  update  of  standardized \nbaselines”, the DOE shall request the activity participants to provide a revised PoA-DD, \napplying the standardized baseline in accordance with the activity standard. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the generic CP meets all the applicability conditions of \nthe  selected methodologies,  the  selected  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied \nmethodological  regulatory  documents.  This  shall  be  undertaken  by  validating  the \ndocumentation referred to in the PoA-DD and by verifying that the documentation content \nis correctly quoted and interpreted in the PoA-DD. If the DOE, based on local and sectoral \nknowledge, is aware that comparable information is available from credible sources other \nthan those used in the PoA-DD, then the DOE shall cross-check the PoA-DD against such \n\n20 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nother  sources  to  confirm  that  the  generic  CP  meets  the  applicability  conditions  of  the \nselected  methodologies,  the  selected  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents. \n\n82. \n\nFor  each  applicability  condition  listed  in  the  selected  methodologies,  the  selected \nstandardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the \nDOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the relevant information contained in the \nPoA-DD against these criteria. The DOE shall state its opinion regarding the applicability \nof the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied \nmethodological regulatory documents to the proposed generic CP. \n\n83. \n\nIf  the  generic  CP  applies  multiple  methodologies,  the  DOE  shall  assess  and  state  its \nopinion  on  whether  the  methodologies  were  applied  in  accordance  with  the  activity \nstandard. \n\n6.3.3.2. \n\nProject boundary, sources and greenhouse gases \n\n84. \n\n85. \n\n86. \n\n87. \n\n88. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the description of how to define the project boundary of \neach of the corresponding CPs, including which sources and GHGs are to be included in \nthe project boundary under which conditions or circumstances, is in accordance with the \napplied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines. \n\nThe DOE shall confirm that the description of defining the project boundary is based on \ndocumented evidence and, where conducted, an on-site inspection. \n\nIf  the  applied  methodologies  or  the  applied  standardized  baselines  allow  the  activity \nparticipants to choose whether a GHG source or gas is to be included within the project \nboundary,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  activity  participants  have  justified  that \nchoice. The DOE shall determine whether the justification provided is reasonable, based \non  an  assessment  of  supporting  documented  evidence  provided  by  the  activity \nparticipants and corroborated by observations if required. \n\nThe DOE shall describe how the validation of the project boundary has been performed \nby  detailing  the  documentation  assessed  (e.g. a  commissioning  report)  and,  where \nconducted, by describing its observations during any on-site inspection (i.e. observations \nof the physical site or equipment used in the process). \n\nThe DOE shall state whether the description of how to define the project boundary of each \nof the corresponding CPs and the selected GHG sources and gases are justified for the \ngeneric CP. Should the DOE identify GHG emission sources that will be affected by the \nimplementation of corresponding CPs and which are expected to contribute more than 1 \nper cent of the overall expected average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG \nremovals,  and  are  not  addressed  by  the  applied  methodologies  or  the  applied \nstandardized baselines, the DOE shall request a clarification of, revision to, or clarification \nfor  acceptance  of  deviation  from  the  methodologies  or  the  standardized  baselines  in \naccordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies \nand  methodological  tools”  or  the  “Procedure:  Development,  revision,  clarification  and \nupdate of standardized baselines” as applicable. \n\n6.3.3.3. \n\nBaseline scenario \n\n89. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the description of how to establish the baseline scenario \nfor each of the corresponding CPs is in accordance with the applied methodologies, an \napproved  standardized  baseline  that  standardizes  the  baseline  scenario,  other  applied \n\n21 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n90. \n\n91. \n\n92. \n\n93. \n\n94. \n\nmethodological  regulatory  documents  and,  where  applicable,  the  baseline  approaches \nspecified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. The DOE \nshall assess whether a more ambitious baseline requirement, as determined by the host \nParty and approved by the Supervisory Body, has been applied in the identification of the \nmost plausible baseline scenario, if applicable. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the description of how to establish the baseline scenario \nin the case where it is foreseen that the future anthropogenic emissions by sources are \nprojected to rise above current levels due to the specific circumstances of the host Party \ncomplies with guidance on suppressed demand in the applied methodology. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  describe  whether  the  description  of  the  identification  of  the  baseline \nscenario in the generic CP-DD is in accordance with the selected standardized baseline if \nthe generic CP uses an approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline \nscenario. \n\nIf the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the \nidentification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on financial \nexpertise  and  local  and  sectoral  knowledge,  determine  whether  all  scenarios  that  are \nconsidered by the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those \nrequired by the methodologies, are realistic and credible in the context of the generic CP \nand that no alternative scenario has been excluded. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether any procedure contained in the applied methodologies, \nmethodological  tool  or  other  methodological  regulatory  documents  to  identify  the  most \nreasonable baseline scenario has been correctly applied.  \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the identification of the most plausible baseline scenario \nis  reasonable  by  validating  the  assumptions,  calculations  and  rationales  used  in  the \ngeneric CP-DD. It shall determine whether the documents and sources referred to in the \ngeneric  CP-DD  are  correctly  quoted  and  interpreted.  The  DOE  shall  cross-check  the \ninformation provided in the generic CP-DD with other verifiable and credible sources, such \nas local expert opinion, if available. \n\n95. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  generic  CP-DD  provides  a  description  of  the \ntechnology  that  would  be  deployed  and/or  the  activities  that  would  take  place  in  the \nabsence of each of the corresponding CPs. \n\n96. \n\nThe DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the requirements and state its opinion \non whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nAll  the  assumptions  and  data  used  by  the  activity  participants  are  listed  in  the \ngeneric CP-DD, including their references and sources; \n\nAll  documentation  used  is  relevant  for  establishing  the  baseline  scenario  and \ncorrectly quoted and interpreted in the generic CP-DD; \n\nAssumptions  and  data  used  in  the  identification  of  the  baseline  scenario  are \njustified appropriately, supported by evidence, and can be deemed reasonable; \n\nRelevant  national  and/or  sectoral  policies,  regulations  and  circumstances  are \nconsidered and listed in the generic CP-DD; \n\n22 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(e) \n\nThe  applied  methodologies  have  been  correctly  followed  to  describe  the \nidentification  of  the  most  plausible  baseline  scenario,  and  the  description \nreasonably represents what would occur in the absence of corresponding CPs. \n\n97. \n\nThe DOE shall describe other steps taken and sources of information used to cross-check \nthe information contained in the generic CP-DD. \n\n6.3.3.4. \n\nBusiness-as-usual scenario or benchmark \n\n98. \n\nThe  DOE  shall  assess  whether,  in  the  generic  CP-DD,  the  identification  and  the \ndescription of the business-as-usual (hereinafter referred as BAU) scenario or reference \nbenchmark  emissions  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  activity  standard,  applied \nmethodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\n6.3.3.5. \n\nEstimation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n99. \n\nThe DOE shall determine whether the description of how to undertake the ex ante and ex \npost calculations of baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as \nwell as GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by each of the \ncorresponding  CPs  are  in  accordance  with  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied \nstandardized  baselines,  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents  and, \nwhere  applicable,  the  standard  for  sampling  and  surveys  for  A6.4  activities  to  be \ndeveloped by the Supervisory Body.  \n\n100.  Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied \nmethodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or \nparameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided \n(based on the choice of the baseline scenario, context of the proposed generic CP and \nother evidence provided) and that the correct equations and parameters have been used, \nin accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the \nother applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n101.  The DOE shall verify the justification given in the generic CP-DD for the choice of data \n\nand parameters used in the equations, as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nData and parameters fixed ex ante: If data and parameters will not be monitored \nthroughout the crediting periods of corresponding CPs but will be determined prior \nto their inclusion in the proposed A6.4 PoA individually for each CP and will remain \nfixed  throughout  the  crediting  periods,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the \nidentification of all data sources and assumptions are appropriate and applicable \nto the generic CP, and will result in an accurate or otherwise conservative estimate \nof GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals. If the applied methodologies \nrequire that any of these data and parameters be determined in accordance with \nthe standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the \nSupervisory Body, the DOE shall determine whether the generic CP-DD states the \nnecessity of conducting such sampling in accordance with this standard; \n\nData and parameters to be monitored: If data and parameters will be monitored \nor  estimated  on  implementation  of  corresponding  CPs  and  hence  become \navailable only after the inclusion of corresponding CPs, the DOE shall determine \nwhether the modalities for estimation of these data and parameters provided in the \ngeneric CP-DD are reasonable. If the applied methodologies require that any of \nthese estimates be determined in accordance with the standard for sampling and \n\n23 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nsurveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body, the DOE shall \ndetermine  whether  the  generic  CP-DD  states  the  necessity  of  conducting  such \nsampling in accordance with this standard. \n\n102.  For  projects  involving  removals  that  also  result  in  emission  reductions,  the  DOE  shall \nassess whether the estimation of removals and emission reductions is separated and that \nit  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  applied  methodology(ies)  applicable  to  the \ngeneric CP.  \n\n103.  The DOE shall determine whether, in the generic CP-DD, the steps taken to calculate the \ndifference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the crediting \nperiod and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward adjustment \nbased  on  BAU  are  in  compliance  with  relevant  provisions  of  the  activity  standard,  the \nmethodologies  standard,  applied  methodologies  and  other  applied  methodological \nregulatory documents.  \n\n104.  The DOE shall assess whether the approach to determining whether the baseline shall be \nadjusted  downward,  was  applied  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  activity \nstandard,  respective  provisions  of  the  methodologies  standard,  applied  methodologies \nand other applied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\n105.  The DOE shall determine whether the  approach to determine leakage emissions in the \ngeneric CP-DD is in accordance with activity standard and relevant applied methodologies \nand other applied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\n106.  The  DOE  shall  also  assess  whether  the  approaches  for  avoiding  or  minimizing  and \naccounting for leakage emissions are in line with the respective requirements of the activity \nstandard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.   \n\n107.

Description of component project \n\n132.  The  DOE  shall  describe  the  process  undertaken  to  validate  the  accuracy  and \ncompleteness of the description of the proposed CP in the CP-DD and state its opinion on \nthe accuracy and completeness of the description. \n\n7.5.  Avoidance of double or revived registration \n\n133.  The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirement relating to double or revived \nregistration contained in the activity standard based on the publicly available information \nand/or the information provided by the activity participants upon its request. \n\n7.6.  Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines \n\n134.  The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are compatible with \nthe methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance \nwith paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. \n\n135. \n\nIf the DOE, based on local and sectoral knowledge, is aware that comparable information \nis available from credible sources other than those used in the CP-DD, it shall cross-check \nthe  CP-DD  against  such  other  sources  to  confirm  that  the  proposed  CP  meets  the \napplicability  conditions  of  the  selected  methodologies,  the  selected  standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n136.  The  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  proposed  CP  has  selected  the  standardized \n\nbaselines where their selection is mandatory. \n\n137. \n\nIf the DOE cannot determine the applicability of the selected methodology, methodological \ntool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed CP, the DOE shall request a clarification \non  the  applicability  in  accordance  with  the  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and \nclarification  of  methodologies  and  methodological \ntools”  and/or  the  “Procedure: \nDevelopment, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. \n\n7.6.1.  Deviation from methodology or methodological tool \n\n138.  The  DOE  may  seek  a  clarification  from  the  Supervisory  Body  on  the  acceptability  of  a \ndeviation from the selected  methodology  or  methodological  tool  in accordance with  the \n“Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological \ntools” prior to the inclusion of the proposed CP, if the DOE, when performing validation for \nthe  inclusion  of  the  CP  in  the  registered  A6.4  PoA,  or  upon  request  from  the  activity \nparticipants,  finds  that,  due  to  a  project-specific13  issue  implying  that  a  revision  of  the \n\n13  Examples of project-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\n(a)  The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a \ncertain  method.  The  activity  participants  of  the  proposed  CP  face  a  difficulty  in  acquiring  the \nspecified instrumentation or a difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however, they \ncan achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative instrumentation or \nmeasurement method; \n\n(b)  A proposed CP does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology for a certain \nparameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the CP to estimate the parameter with \nequal reliability and accuracy; \n\n30 of 74 \n\n  \n \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmethodology and/or methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the \nCP deviated from: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe selected methodology or methodological tool; or \n\nSections  in  the  selected  methodology  or  methodological  tool  that  are  not \nstandardized by the selected standardized baselines, if the proposed CP applies \nstandardized baselines. \n\n139.  The  DOE  shall  submit  an  assessment  of  the  case  including  demonstration  that  the \ndeviation does not require revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool, \nand shall include a description of the impact of the deviation on GHG emission reductions \nor net GHG removals by the CP. \n\n140.  Alternatively,  if  the  DOE  considers  that  a  revision  of  the  selected  methodology  or \nmethodological tool would be required to address the project situation, then the DOE shall \nsubmit,  or  shall  request  the  activity  participants  to  submit,  a request  for  revision  of  the \nselected  methodology  or  methodological  tool  in  accordance  with  the  “Procedure: \nDevelopment, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and, \nupon its revision, proceed with a request for post-registration changes to the registered \nA6.4 PoA to apply the revised version.  \n\n7.7.  Application of methodologies and standardized baselines \n\n7.7.1.  Host Party methodological requirements \n\n141.  The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are applied in a way \nto comply with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party \nin accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable. \n\n7.7.2.  Project boundary, sources, leakage and greenhouse gases \n\n142. \n\n143. \n\nIf  the  applied  methodologies  and  the  applied  standardized  baselines  allow  the  activity \nparticipants to choose whether a GHG source or gas is to be included within the project \nboundary,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  activity  participants  have  justified  that \nchoice and whether the justification provided is reasonable. \n\nIf the DOE identifies GHG emission sources that will be affected by the implementation of \nthe CP and which are expected to contribute more than 1 per cent of the overall expected \naverage annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, and are not addressed \nby  the  applied  methodologies  or  the  applied  standardized  baselines,  the  DOE  shall \n\n(c)  A minor deviation is sought for a project-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative. \nFor example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5 per \ncent of rated capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the \nplant has never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated \ncapacity  (20  per  cent  below  the  rated  capacity).  A  deviation  can  be  presented  specifying \nconservative approaches to calculate the emission reduction in such a project-specific case; \n\n(d)  A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to \nproject-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology, for example, a well-justified \nconservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to address \nuncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period. \n\n31 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nrequest  a  clarification  of,  revision  to,  or  deviation  from,  the  methodologies  or  the \nstandardized baselines, as appropriate, in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, \nrevision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” or the “Procedure: \nDevelopment, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. \n\n7.7.3.  Baseline scenario \n\n144. \n\nIf the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the \nidentification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on its expertise \nand local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are considered by \nthe activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those required by the \nmethodologies are realistic and credible in the context of the proposed  CP and that no \nalternative scenario has been excluded. The DOE shall assess whether a more ambitious \nbaseline requirement, as determined by the host Party and approved by the Supervisory \nBody,  has  been  applied  in  the  identification  of  the  most  plausible  baseline  scenario,  if \napplicable.  \n\n145.  The  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  most  plausible  baseline  scenario  identified  is \nreasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the CP-DD. \n\n146.  Notwithstanding paragraphs 144 and 145 above, if the proposed CP applies an approved \nstandardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the DOE shall determine \nwhether  the  baseline  scenario  for  the  CP  is  the  scenario  specified  by  the  applied \nstandardized baseline. \n\n7.7.4.  Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark \n\n147.  The DOE shall assess whether the identification and the description in the CP-DD of the \nBAU  scenario  or  reference  benchmark  emissions  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the \nactivity  standard,  applied  methodologies  and  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments.  \n\n7.7.5.  Demonstration of additionality \n\n148.  The DOE shall determine whether the additionality of the proposed CP is demonstrated in \naccordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the \napplied  methodological  tools  for  demonstration  of  additionality,  if  any,  by  verifying  the \nreliability  and  credibility  of  all  data  used,  and  rationales,  assumptions  and  justifications \nprovided by the activity participants, and critically assessing the evidence presented, using \nlocal knowledge and sectoral and financial expertise. \n\n149.  Notwithstanding  paragraph  148  above,  if  the  proposed  CP  applies  an  approved \nstandardized baseline that standardizes additionality, the DOE shall determine whether \nthe project meets the additionality criteria in the applied standardized baseline. \n\n150.  The DOE shall determine if the proposed CP complies with all conditions of the eligibility \ncriteria in the PoA-DD as per paragraph 33(g) above that ensure that the CP meets the \nrequirements for demonstration of additionality. \n\n32 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n7.7.6.  Addressing  non-permanence  for  component  projects  involving  removals  and \n\nemission reduction component projects with reversal risks \n\n151.  The DOE shall determine whether the risks of reversals were identified and assessed in \ncompliance with requirements of the activity standard, provisions of the removals standard \nand other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n152.  The DOE shall determine whether the risk assessment was conducted in accordance with \nthe applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n153.  The DOE shall assess the reviewed and updated risk assessment of CPs included in the \nregistered A6.4 PoA every five years from the start of the first crediting period and in any \nof the following circumstances: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan \nof  a  particular  CP/(s)  based  on  any  concerns  identified with  the  monitoring  plan \nand the risk assessment plan; \n\nAdditional risk factors are identified following a reversal in a particular CP/(s) that \nare not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the \nrisk assessment plan; \n\nThe  applicable  national  or  regional  regulations  require  the  consideration  of  risk \nfactors that are not included or are not adequately assessed in the monitoring plan \nof a particular CP/(s) and the risk assessment plan.   \n\n7.7.7.  Estimation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n154.  Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied \nmethodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or \nparameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided \n(based  on  the  choice  of  the  baseline  scenario,  context  of  the  CP  and  other  evidence \nprovided) and that the correct equations and parameters have been used, in accordance \nwith the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied \nmethodological regulatory documents. \n\n155.  For CPs involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the DOE shall assess \nwhether  the  estimation  of  removals  and  emission  reductions  is  separated  and  was \nundertaken in accordance with the applied methodology(ies).  \n\n156.  The DOE shall determine whether the correct approaches were applied for the estimation \nof  BAU  emissions,  baseline  emissions,  project  emissions  and  leakage  emissions  in \naccordance  with \nthe  activity  standard  and  applied \nmethodology(ies). \n\nthe  relevant  provisions  of \n\n157.  The DOE shall assess whether the difference between the baseline emissions and BAU \nemissions  as  an  annual  and  total  amount  with  respect  to  the  crediting  period  was \nestimated correctly following the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD.  \n\n158.  The DOE shall assess whether the downwards adjustment of the baseline, if applicable, \nwas applied as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD and in compliance with \nthe  requirements  of  the  activity  standard,  respective  provisions  of  the  methodologies \nstandard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\n33 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n159.  The DOE shall determine whether the leakage emissions were identified, described and \ncalculated in accordance with activity standard, relevant applied methodologies and other \napplied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\n160.  The DOE shall also assess whether the leakage emissions are avoided or minimized and \naccounted  for  in  line  with  the  respective  requirements  of  the  activity  standard,  applied \nmethodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.   \n\n161.  The DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe equations and parameters are applied to calculate GHG emission reductions \nor  net  GHG  removals  for  the  CP  in  accordance  with  the  modalities  in  the \ncorresponding generic CP; \n\nThe data and parameters fixed ex ante are used in the equations to calculate GHG \nemission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  for  the  CP  in  accordance  with  the \nmodalities in the corresponding generic CP; \n\nThe  methodologies  and,  where  applicable,  the  standardized  baselines  and  the \nother  methodological  regulatory  documents  are  applied  correctly  to  calculate \nbaseline, project and leakage GHG emissions as well as GHG emission reductions \nor  net  GHG  removals  in  accordance  with  the  modalities  in  the  corresponding \ngeneric CP; \n\nThe ex ante estimates of baseline, project and leakage GHG emissions as well as \nGHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are provided, including whether \nthe  estimates  can  be  replicated,  in  accordance  with  the  modalities  in  the \ncorresponding generic CP. \n\n7.7.8.

The DOE shall determine whether there is a temporary deviation from the monitoring plan \nin the included CP-DD (hereinafter referred to as the registered monitoring plan), the A6.4 \nSD  Tool  forms  (A6.4  Environmental  and  social  management  plan  form  and  A6.4 \nthe  applied \nSustainable  development \nstandardized  baselines  or  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents, \nincluding the A6.4 SD Tool and, if there is, the DOE shall determine whether the temporary \ndeviation complies with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. \n\nthe  applied  methodologies, \n\nimpact \n\nform), \n\n192. \n\nIf  the  DOE  identifies  that  the  activity  participants  have  temporarily  deviated  from  the \nregistered  monitoring  plan,  the  A6.4  SD  Tool  forms  (A6.4  Environmental  and  social \nsafeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form \nand A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), the applied methodologies, the A6.4 SD \nTool, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory \ndocuments, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have described the \nnature,  extent  and  duration  of  the  non-conforming  monitoring  period,  and  proposed \nalternative monitoring  arrangements  or  applied  the  most  conservative  values  approach \nreferred to in the activity standard for the non-conforming monitoring period. \n\n193. \n\nIf the DOE determines that the activity participants have proposed alternative monitoring \narrangements  for  the  non-conforming  monitoring  period,  it  shall  determine  whether  the \narrangements apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the calculations to \nthe extent required to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not \nbe overestimated as a result of the deviation. \n\n194. \n\nIf  the  deviation  from  the  registered  monitoring  plan,  the  applied  methodologies  or  the \napplied  standardized  baselines  is  applicable  to  the  monitoring  period  under  verification \nand part of the previous or subsequent monitoring period, the DOE shall determine the \nexact period to which the deviation applies. \n\n195.  The  DOE  shall  state  its  opinion  on  whether  the  deviation  complies  with  the  relevant \n\nrequirements in the activity standard. \n\n8.2.3.  Permanent changes \n\n8.2.3.1. \n\nCorrections \n\n196. \n\nIf the activity participants have made corrections to the project information or parameters \nfixed  at  the  registration  of  the  A6.4  PoA  or  inclusion  of  the  CP  as  described  in  the \nregistered PoA-DD or CP-DD, the DOE shall determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe activity participants documented them in a revised PoA-DD or CP-DD; \n\nThe corrected  information  is  an  accurate  reflection  of  actual  project  information; \nand/or \n\nThe corrected parameters are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the \nregistered  monitoring  plan,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other \napplied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n40 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n197.

The  DOE  shall  state  its  opinion  on  whether  the  change  complies  with  the  relevant \n\nrequirements in the activity standard. \n\n8.2.3.3. \n\nInclusion of monitoring plan \n\n200. \n\nIf the activity participants chose to omit a monitoring plan at the inclusion of the CP and \nwish to include it thereafter, the DOE shall determine whether the design of the monitoring \nplan and other sections of the CP-DD comply with the relevant requirements in the activity \nstandard  and  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  requirements  contained  in  section  7.7.8 \nabove. \n\n201.  The  DOE  shall  state  its  opinion  on  whether  the  monitoring  plan  in  the  revised  CP-DD \n\ncomplies with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. \n\n8.2.3.4. \n\nPermanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or A6.4 SD Tool \nforms  (A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk  assessment  form, \nA6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable \ndevelopment  impact  form),  or  permanent  deviation  of  monitoring  from  the \napplied  methodologies,  standardized  baselines,  or  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool \n\n202. \n\nIf the activity participants wish to make a permanent change to the registered monitoring \nplan,  or  if  the  monitoring  permanently  deviates  from  the  applied  methodologies,  the \nthe  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \napplied  standardized  baselines,  or \ndocuments, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have described the \nnature  and  extent  of  the  non-conforming  monitoring  and  the  proposed  alternative \nmonitoring for  the  CP  in  the  revised  CP-DD,  the  permanent  changes  or  deviation,  and \nwhether the proposed alternative monitoring complies with the relevant requirements in \nthe activity standard. \n\n203.  The DOE shall determine whether the permanent change to the registered monitoring plan \nin the revised CP-DD is in line with the description in the generic CP-DD in the registered \nPoA-DD of how to develop the monitoring plan for each of the corresponding CPs and is \nin compliance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the \nother applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n204. \n\nIf the DOE determines that the permanent change or the permanent deviation described \nin  the  revised  CP-DD  is  not  in  line  with  the  description  in  the  generic  CP-DD  in  the \nregistered PoA-DD of how to develop the monitoring plan for each of the corresponding \nCPs,  the  DOE  shall  request  the  activity  participants  to  prepare  a  revised  PoA-DD  to \naccommodate  the  permanent  changes  or  permanent  deviation  for  approval  by  the \nSupervisory  Body  first.  Upon  such  revision  of  the  PoA-DD,  the  DOE  shall  determine \n\n41 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nwhether  the  revised  description  is  in  compliance  with  the  applied  methodologies,  the \napplied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments.  If  the  revised  description  deviates  from  them,  the  DOE  shall  determine \nwhether the conservative assumptions or discount factors are applied. \n\n205.  The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring \nplan  or  the  permanent  deviation  of  the  monitoring  from  the  applied  methodologies,  the \napplied standardized baselines, or other applied methodological regulatory documents are \nlikely to lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation of GHG emission reductions \nor net GHG removals. If the DOE considers that the permanent changes or the permanent \ndeviation will lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation, the DOE shall request \nthe  activity  participants  to  apply  conservative  assumptions  or  discount  factors  to  the \ncalculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG \nremovals will not be overestimated as a result of the permanent change or the permanent \ndeviation. \n\n206.  The  DOE  shall  state  its  opinion  on  whether  the  permanent  changes  or  the  permanent \n\ndeviation comply with the relevant requirements in the activity standard. \n\n207.  The  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  permanent  changes  to  the  A6.4  SD  Tool  forms \n(A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk  assessment  form,  A6.4  Environmental \nand  social  management  plan  form  and  A6.4  Sustainable  development  impact  form), \nprovided  as  part  of  the  revised  CP-DD  are  in  compliance  with  the  A6.4  SD  Tool  and \nrelevant provisions of the activity standard.  \n\n208.  For component projects involving removals and emission reduction component projects \nwith  reversal  risks,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the  monitoring  plan  and  the  risk \nassessment plan were reviewed and updated every five years and in the circumstances \nspecified in paragraph 153 above, in accordance with relevant provisions of the activity \nstandard, removals standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  \n\n8.2.3.5. \n\nChanges to the programme or project design  \n\n209. \n\nIf the activity participants wish to make a proposed change or have made an actual change \nto the design of a registered A6.4 PoA or to the design of an included CP, the DOE shall \ndetermine  whether  the  change  complies  with  the  relevant  requirements  in  the  activity \nstandard. \n\n210.  The DOE shall determine whether the change to the design of the registered A6.4 PoA is \n\nfor one or more of the following purposes: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nTo expand the programmes’ boundary to expand the geographic coverage or to \ninclude additional host Parties; \n\nTo  remove  a  methodology  and/or  standardized  baseline  from  the  registered \nPoA-DD; \n\nTo change the capacity range specified in the registered PoA-DD; \n\nTo change the design of the PoA; \n\nTo add new components or extend/add technologies/measures, provided that they \ncomply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that the host Party  would approve in \naccordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs; \n\n42 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n(j) \n\n(k) \n\nTo remove a component or technology/measure described in the registered PoA-\nDD; \n\nTo change the technologies/measures specified in the registered PoA-DD; \n\nTo change a generic CP to: \n\n(i) \n\nApply an applicable and valid standardized baseline to determine baseline \nemissions or parameter values; \n\n(ii)  Switch from an ex post to an ex ante determination of parameter values for \n\ncalculating baseline emissions using a standardized baseline; \n\nTo make  any  consequential  changes to the  application of methodologies  and/or \nin \nthe  standardized  baselines \nsubparagraphs (b)− (h) above; \n\nthe  changes \n\nresulting \n\nreferred \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\nTo voluntarily update the applied methodologies to a later valid version of the same \nmethodologies, or to change to another methodology;15 \n\nTo make any consequential changes to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in \nthe registered A6.4 PoA, resulting from the changes referred to in subparagraphs \n(a)− (j) above; \n\n211. \n\nIf the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to expand the geographic coverage or to \ninclude additional host Parties, the DOE shall assess and confirm that: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe registered PoA-DD has been revised to reflect the changes, in particular the \neligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs; \n\nThe  baseline  setting  described  in  the  relevant  generic  CP  in  the  PoA-DD  is \napplicable to the expanded PoA boundary; \n\nIn the case of inclusion of additional host Parties, each DNA of the new host Parties \nhas provided an approval of the PoA in accordance with section 6.2.11 above, and \nconfirmed that the host Party and the other participating Party, if applicable, have \nprovided  authorization  of  activity  participants  in  accordance  with  section  6.2.12 \nabove. \n\n212. \n\nIf  the  registered  A6.4  PoA  has  been  amended  to  revise  the  eligibility  criteria  for  the \ninclusion of CPs, the DOE shall assess and confirm that: \n\n(a) \n\nThe revision of the eligibility criteria complies with the provisions and conditions set \nout in the activity standard.

When conducting the validations referred to in paragraphs 215−220 above, by means of \nan on-site inspection or other means of validation carried out in accordance with paragraph \n\n45 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n125  or  126  above,  the  DOE  shall  assess  the  impacts  of  the  actual  changes  on  the \nmonitoring plan, the level of accuracy of the monitoring activity, the applied methodologies, \nthe  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments. \n\n224.  The DOE shall, by means of reviewing the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD against applicable \nadditionality and other methodological requirements, determine whether the proposed or \nactual  change  would  adversely  affect  the  conclusions  of  the  validation  report  on  the \nregistered A6.4 PoA or the included CP with regard to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe  applicability  and  application  of  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied \nstandardized  baselines  and \nthe  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments with which the PoA or CP has been registered or included; \n\nThe compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied \nstandardized  baselines  and \nthe  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments; \n\nThe level of accuracy and completeness of the monitoring for the PoA or the CP; \n\nThe additionality of the PoA or CP; \n\nCompliance with the A6.4 SD Tool; \n\nThe eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA. \n\n225. \n\nIf the DOE determines that the proposed or actual change affects the additionality of the \nregistered  A6.4  PoA  or  the  included  CP,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the \ndemonstration of the impacts of the changes on the additionality is based on all original \ninput data. \n\n226.  Notwithstanding paragraph 225 above, if the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP uses \nan approved standardized baseline that standardizes additionality, and if the proposed or \nactual  change  affects  the  additionality  of  the  PoA  or  the  included  CP,  the  DOE  shall \ndetermine whether the demonstration of the impacts of the change on the additionality is \nbased on the additionality criteria identified in the applied standardized baseline. \n\n227.  The  DOE  shall  assess  whether  the  revised  PoA-DD  or  CP-DD  complies  with  all  the \nrequirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the \nother applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n228. \n\n229. \n\nIf  the  activity  participants  have  voluntarily  updated  the  applied  methodologies  and/or \nstandardized baselines to a later valid version of them, or changed to other methodologies \nor  standardized  baselines,  the  DOE  shall  confirm  that  the  revised  PoA-DD  meets  all \nrequirements  of \nthe  standards, \nmethodological  tools  and  guidelines  applied  in  accordance  with  the  updated/changed \nmethodologies and/or the updated/changed standardized baselines. \n\nthe  updated/changed  methodologies, \n\nincluding \n\nIf the changes to the programme or project design affect the identification, assessment or \nmonitoring of environmental, social or sustainable development impacts, the DOE shall \nassess whether the impacts caused by the changes were assessed and revised versions \nof  the  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk  assessment  form,  A6.4 \nEnvironmental  and  social  management  plan  form  (if  applicable)  and  A6.4  Sustainable \ndevelopment impact form were provided. The DOE shall assess, prior to or as part of the \n\n46 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nfirst verification of emission reductions or net removals, whether the revised A6.4 SD Tool \nforms are in compliance with requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. \n\n230.  The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the proposed or actual change complies with \n\nthe relevant requirements in the activity standard. \n\n231.  The DOE shall state its opinion on: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA description of the proposed or actual change as compared to the description in \nthe registered PoA-DD or CP-DD; \n\nAn assessment of when the change occurred or will occur, reasons for the change \ntaking place, whether the change would have been known prior to the registration \nof the A6.4 PoA or the inclusion of the CP, how the change would impact the overall \noperation/ability of the PoA or CP to deliver GHG emission reductions or net GHG \nremovals as stated in the PoA-DD or CP-DD, and whether the revised estimation \nof GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals due to the changes are within \nthe applicable limits allowed in accordance with the activity standard; \n\n(c) \n\nAn assessment of whether the change would adversely affect the conclusions of \nthe validation report on the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP with regard to: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  applicability  and  application  of:  (1)  the  applied  methodologies,  the \napplied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological \nregulatory documents with which the PoA or the CP has been registered or \nincluded; (2) the later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied \nstandardized  baselines  and/or the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments  or  other  methodologies  and/or  standardized  baselines  that  the \nPoA or the CP has been updated/changed to; \n\n(ii)  The  project  boundary  of  the  CP  and  any  associated  leakages  due  to  the \n\nchanges; \n\n(iii)  The  compliance  of \n\nthe  applied \nmethodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents; \n\nthe  revised  monitoring  plan  with \n\n(iv)  The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring of the PoA or the \nCP compared with the requirements contained in the registered monitoring \nplan; \n\n(v)  The additionality of the PoA or the CP; \n\n(vi)  Compliance with SD Tool; \n\n(vii)  The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA. \n\n232. \n\nIn validating the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD containing the proposed or actual change, and \nin preparing the opinion, the DOE shall include the information on how: \n\n47 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(a) \n\nThe proposed revision ensures that the level of accuracy and completeness16 in \nthe monitoring and verification process is not reduced as a result of the revision. \nThe DOE shall, using objective evidence, assess the accuracy and completeness \nof each proposed change to the registered monitoring plan, including the frequency \n(e.g. calibration \nof  measurements, \nrequirements) and the quality assurance and quality control procedures; \n\nthe  quality  of  monitoring  equipment \n\n(b) \n\nThe proposed revision complies with all requirements of: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the \nother applied methodological regulatory documents; or \n\n(ii)  The \n\nupdated/changed  methodologies, \n\nstandards, \nmethodological  tools  and  guidelines  applied  in  accordance  with  the \nupdated/changed methodologies, and/or the updated/changed standardized \nbaselines, if the applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines have \nbeen voluntarily updated to a later valid version of them or changed to other \nmethodologies or standardized baselines; \n\nincluding \n\nthe \n\n(iii)  The  findings  of  previous  verification  and  certification  reports,  if  any,  have \n\nbeen taken into account. \n\n8.2.3.6. \n\nChange of activity participant \n\n233. \n\nIf,  subsequent  to  the  registration  of  the  A6.4  PoA,  the  activity  participants  have  been \nchanged, either the DOE undertaking the next inclusion of a proposed CP,  or the DOE \nthat submits the next request for issuance of Article 6.4 emission reductions (A6.4ERs) for \nthe PoA, or the DOE that submits the next post-registration change request for the PoA, \nwhichever  is  earlier,  shall  determine  whether  the  new  activity  participant  has  been \nauthorized by the host Party of, or any other participating Party in, the PoA in accordance \nwith the activity cycle procedure. \n\n234.  The  DOE  shall  submit  the  validation  opinion  to  the  secretariat  in  accordance  with  the \n\nactivity cycle procedure. \n\n235.  Notwithstanding the timing referred to in paragraph 233 above, the DOE shall submit the \nvalidation opinion to the secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle procedure if the \nactivity participants wish the DOE to do so before the next inclusion of a proposed CP, the \nnext request for issuance of A6.4ERs or the next post-registration change request for the \nPoA. \n\n8.2.4.  Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme \n\n236.  The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to registration or \ncoverage by a programme, under any other international, regional, national, or subnational \nor sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme contained in the activity standard based \non  the  publicly  available  information  and/or  the  information  provided  by  the  activity \nparticipants upon its request. \n\n16  Completeness refers to inclusion of all relevant information for assessment of GHG emission reductions \nand the information supporting the methods applied as required. For example, if the DOE identifies an \non-site generator for emergency use which was not included in  the registered monitoring plan during \nthe verification process, the monitoring of fuel consumption of this generator should be included in the \nmonitoring plan \n\n48 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n8.3.  Validation report \n\n237. \n\nIn its validation report for the post-registration changes, the DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\nReport  on  all  items  listed  in  paragraph  120  above  except  for  its  subparagraph \n120(g) above; \n\n(b) \n\nProvide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusion on the assessment of: \n\n(i)  Whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD is prepared using the valid version \n\nof the applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable; \n\n(ii)  Whether the information transferred to the later valid version of the PoA-DD \nor CP-DD form is materially the same as that in the registered PoA-DD or \nCP-DD, as applicable; \n\n(iii)  Whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD is prepared in both track-change and \n\nclean versions; \n\n(iv)  Whether  the  revised  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk \nassessment  form,  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  management  plan  form \nand A6.4 Sustainable development impact form are prepared using the valid \nversion  of  the  applicable  forms  and  following  the  instructions  therein,  as \napplicable; \n\n(v)  The compliance of the proposed or actual post-registration changes with the \nrequirement  for  post-registration  changes  conducted  in  accordance  with \nsections  8.1–8.2  above,  including  the  CARs,  CLs  or  FARs  issued  to  the \nactivity participants and how they have been addressed by them. \n\n238.  The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the validation outcome, containing: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA positive validation opinion and the date of submission of the validation report as \npart of the request for approval of post-registration changes to the secretariat; or \n\nA  negative  validation  opinion,  including  the  reasons  for  the  post-registration \nchanges  as  documented  having  been  determined  as  not  complying  with  the \nrelevant requirements for post-registration changes. \n\n9.  Verification of implementation and monitoring \n\n9.1.  Objective of verification  \n\n239.  The DOE shall conduct a thorough and independent assessment of the implementation \nand the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by a registered \nA6.4 PoA and the included CPs against the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and \nrequirements. \n\n9.1.1.  Overarching requirements \n\n240.  The DOE shall assess and determine whether the implementation and operation of the \nregistered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs, and the steps taken to report GHG emission \nreductions  or net GHG removals,  comply  with  the  relevant  Article 6.4  mechanism  rules \nand requirements. This assessment shall involve a review of relevant documentation as \n\n49 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nwell  as,  where  conducted  in  accordance  with  paragraphs  264–265  below,  an  on-site \ninspection(s).  For  an  on-site inspection(s), the  DOE  may  apply  a  sampling  approach  in \naccordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed \nby the Supervisory Body. \n\n241.  The DOE shall assess whether the data collection system meets the requirements of the \nregistered  monitoring  plan  as  per  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized \nbaselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n242.  The DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDetermine  whether  the  registered  A6.4  PoA  and  the  included  CPs  have  been \nimplemented and are operating in accordance with the registered PoA-DD and CP-\nDDs; \n\nDetermine  whether  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  have  been \nmonitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan(s). \n\n9.1.2.  Other requirements \n\n243.  The  DOE  shall  assess  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  information  on  GHG  emission \n\nreductions or net GHG removals provided in the monitoring report.17 \n\n244. \n\nIn addition to the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall review: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nThe registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs, including the registered monitoring plan(s) \nand/or the changes to the registered PoA-DD or CP-DDs, and the corresponding \nvalidation opinions; \n\nThe validation report; \n\nPrevious verification and certification reports, if any; \n\nThe  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other \napplied methodological regulatory documents; \n\nThe monitoring results of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable \ndevelopment impacts of the included CPs; \n\nAny other information and references relevant to the GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals  achieved by the included CPs (e.g. Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change (IPCC) reports, data on electricity generation in the national \ngrid or laboratory analysis, national regulations). \n\n245. \n\nIn addition to reviewing the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall determine whether \nthe activity participants have addressed the FARs identified during the previous validation \nor verification. \n\n17  Quantitative  information  comprises  the  reported  numbers  in  the  monitoring  report.  Qualitative \ninformation comprises information on internal management controls, calculation procedures, procedures \nfor transfer of data, frequency of the monitoring reports, and review and internal audit of calculations. \n\n50 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n9.1.3.  Quality of evidence \n\n246.  When  verifying  the reported GHG emission  reductions  or  net GHG removals,  the  DOE \nshall confirm that there is an audit trail that contains the evidence and records that validate \nor invalidate the stated figures. The audit trail shall include the source documents that form \nthe basis for assumptions and other information underlying the GHG data. \n\n247.  When assessing the audit trail, the DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nAddress whether there is sufficient evidence available, both in terms of frequency \n(time  period  between  evidence)  and  coverage  (in  covering  the  full  monitoring \nperiod); \n\nAddress  the  source  and  nature  of  the  evidence  (external  or  internal,  oral  or \ndocumented); \n\nCross-check  the  monitoring  report  against  other  sources,  such  as  comparable \ninformation, where available, from sources other than those used in the monitoring \nreport, to determine whether the stated figures are correct. \n\n248.  The DOE shall only certify GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that are based \n\non verifiable evidence. \n\n9.1.4.  Application of materiality \n\n9.1.4.1. \n\nGeneral \n\n249.  The  concept  of  materiality  is  applicable  to  the  verification  of  monitored  GHG  emission \nreductions or net GHG removals achieved by all types of registered A6.4 PoAs. It is not \napplicable to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nUncertainties related to measurement; \n\nAddressing  temporary  deviations  and  permanent  changes  to  the  registered \nmonitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines, \nregardless  of  whether  the  corresponding  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \nremovals are above or below materiality thresholds. \n\n250.  A DOE that plans and conducts verification using the concept of materiality shall achieve \na reasonable level of assurance that the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG \nremovals  are  free  from  material  errors,  omissions  or misstatements  in accordance  with \nparagraphs 251−261 below. \n\n251.  An  omission,  misstatement,  or  erroneous  reporting  of  information  is  material  if  it  might \nlead, at an aggregated level, to an overestimation of the total GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals achieved by a registered A6.4 PoA equal to or higher than the following \nthresholds: \n\n(a) \n\n0.5  per  cent  of  the  emission  reductions  or  removals  for  registered  A6.4  PoAs \nachieving a total emission reduction or removal equal to or more than 500,000 t \nCO2 eq per year;18 \n\n18  A year refers to a period of 12 consecutive months. \n\n51 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n1  per  cent  of  the  emission  reductions  or  removals  for  registered  A6.4  PoAs \nachieving  a  total  emission  reduction  or  removal  of  between  300,000  and \n500,000 t CO2 eq per year; \n\n2  per  cent  of  the  emission  reductions  or  removals  for  registered  A6.4  PoAs \nachieving a total emission reduction or removal of 300,000  t CO2 eq per year or \nless. \n\n252.  Recognizing that circumstances may exist that could cause the information reported by \nthe  activity  participants  to  be  materially  misstated,  the  DOE  should  plan  and  perform \nverifications  with  an  attitude  of  professional  scepticism  and  rely  on  its  professional \njudgment when applying the concept of materiality. \n\n253.  The application of the concept of materiality and reasonable level of assurance implies \nthat some data or information may not be checked. However, the DOE should design its \nverification and sampling plans to detect all material errors, omissions or misstatements, \nand any unchecked data or information should not contain any material errors, omissions \nor  misstatements.  A  DOE’s  verification  opinion  applies  to  100 per  cent  of  the  data  and \ninformation, even if the DOE may not have checked the entire data set and information. \n\n254.  Applying  the  concept  of  materiality  does  not  mean  that  identified  errors  are  not  to  be \ncorrected;  if  an  error,  omission  or misstatement  is  identified  by  the  DOE,  regardless  of \nwhether it is material or not, the DOE shall request the activity participants to address it. \n\n9.1.4.2. \n\nConsideration of materiality in planning verification \n\n255.  The DOE should: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nIdentify  the  materiality  threshold  referred  to  in  paragraph  251  above  that \ncorresponds to the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that \nthe specific registered A6.4 PoA will achieve; \n\nUnderstand  the  environment  in  which  the  registered  A6.4  PoA  operates,  the \nsources  of  project  emissions  within  the  project  boundary  and  the  leakage,  the \nmonitoring activities, the equipment used to monitor or measure project data, the \norigin and application of data used to calculate or measure the emissions, the data \nflow, the internal quality control system, and the overall organization with respect \nto monitoring and reporting;19 \n\nConduct  a  risk  assessment  to  identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  individual  or \naggregated material errors, omissions or misstatements that may occur within the \nthreshold based on the elements referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above; \n\nDesign  verification  plans,  audit  procedures20  and  sampling  plans  whose  type, \ntiming21  and  extent  are  based  on  and  are  responsive  to  the  assessed  risks  of \nmaterial errors, omissions or misstatements. \n\n19  Adapted from European Union. 2007. Commission Decision of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for \nthe  monitoring  and  reporting  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  pursuant  to  Directive  2003/87/EC  of  the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council. \n\n20  In accordance with section 9.2.5. \n\n21  For example, timing may refer to the specific time intervals for which the DOE may draw its samples. \n\n52 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n256.  The  materiality  thresholds  apply  to  the  total  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \nremovals  actually  achieved.  When  planning  verification,  the  DOE  should  apply  the \napplicable materiality threshold to the reported total emission reductions or removals. If, \nas a result of the verification, the initially reported total emission reductions or removals is \nrevised,  the  DOE  should  reapply  the  materiality  threshold  to  the  revised  total  emission \nreductions  or  removals  and,  if  needed,  make  adjustments  to  its  verification  plans  and \nsampling plans. \n\n9.1.4.3. \n\nConsideration of materiality in conducting verification \n\n257.  The DOE should: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nApply verification plans, audit procedures and sampling plans; \n\nAssess  potential  errors,  omissions  and  misstatements  against  the  materiality \nthreshold to determine whether they are material individually or in aggregate and \nwhether further audit procedures are needed. \n\n258. \n\n259. \n\n260. \n\nIf an error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE should be aware that it may \nnot  be  an  isolated  occurrence  and  may  be  a  systemic  reoccurring  error.  For  example, \nother errors may exist if the DOE identifies that the error, omission or misstatement arose \nfrom a breakdown in the activity participants’ internal quality control and quality assurance \nsystem. \n\nIf an immaterial error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall request the \nactivity  participants  to  address  it  and  should  determine  whether  additional  audit \nprocedures should be conducted in order to reach a reasonable level of assurance that \nthe verified GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are free from material error, \nomission or misstatement. \n\nIf a material error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall, depending on the \ncircumstances of the error, immediately request the activity participants to address it, or \nconduct additional audit procedures to confirm or determine the context and magnitude of \nthe error, omission or misstatement and then request the activity participants to address \nit. \n\n261. \n\nIf  further  audit  procedures  are  necessary,  the  DOE  may  consider  whether  the  overall \nverification plans and sampling plans need to be revised. \n\n9.1.5.  Standard auditing techniques \n\n262.  The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants. \n\n263. \n\nIn  assessing  the  information,  the  DOE  shall  apply  the  means  of  verification  specified \nthroughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including \nbut not limited to: \n\n(a) \n\nDocument review, involving: \n\n(i) \n\nA review of data and information; \n\n(ii)  A review of the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the \napplied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological \nregulatory  documents,  paying  particular  attention  to  the  frequency  of \n\n53 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmeasurements,  the  quality  of  metering  equipment  including  calibration \nrequirements, and the quality assurance and quality control procedures; \n\n(iii)  An  evaluation  of  data  management  and  the  quality  assurance  and  quality \ncontrol  system  in  the  context  of  their  influence  on  the  generation  and \nreporting of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(b) \n\nFollow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection, telephone/e-mail interviews), including: \n\n(i) \n\nAn assessment of the implementation and operation of the included CPs as \nper the included CP-DDs or latest approved revised CP-DDs; \n\n(ii)  A review of information flows for generating, aggregating and reporting the \n\nmonitoring parameters; \n\n(iii) \n\nInterviews with relevant personnel to determine whether the operational and \ndata  collection  procedures  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nregistered monitoring plans; \n\n(iv)  Cross-checks between the information provided in the monitoring report and \ndata  from  other  sources  such  as  plant  logbooks,  inventories,  purchase \nrecords or similar data sources to determine whether the information in the \nmonitoring report is reliable; \n\n(v)  A check of the monitoring equipment, including calibration performance, and \nobservations  of  monitoring  practices  against  the  requirements  of  the \nregistered  monitoring  plans,  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied \nstandardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory \ndocuments; \n\n(vi)  A review of calculations and assumptions made in determining the GHG data \n\nand GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(vii)  An identification of quality control and quality assurance procedures in place \nto prevent,  or  identify  and correct,  any errors  or omissions  in the  reported \nmonitoring parameters; \n\n(c) \n\nSampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for \nA6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body, including: \n\n(i) \n\nA random sampling for cases where the activity participants did not apply a \nsampling approach to monitoring; \n\n(ii)  An acceptance sampling or another sampling approach for cases where the \n\nactivity participants applied a sampling approach to monitoring. \n\n264. \n\nIt is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at verification for an included \nCP if: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIt is the first verification for the DOE with regard to this CP; \n\nMore than three years have elapsed since the last on-site inspection conducted for \nverification for the CP; or \n\n54 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(c) \n\nThe CP has achieved more than 300,000 t CO2 eq of GHG emission reductions or \nnet  GHG  removals  since  the  last  verification  when  an  on-site  inspection  was \nconducted. \n\n265.  For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 264 above, it is optional for the DOE to \nconduct  an  on-site  inspection  at  verification.  If  the  DOE  does  not  conduct  an  on-site \ninspection  as  a  means  of  verification,  it  shall  describe  the  alternative  means  used  and \njustify that they are sufficient for the purpose of verification. If the DOE conducts a remote \ninspection as  an  alternative  means to  an  on-site inspection,  the  DOE should  follow the \nguidance contained in Appendix 1. \n\n266. \n\nIf any issue related to the project design, including those attributable to the lack of on-site \ninspection  at  the  previous  verification,  is  identified  at  the  verification,  the  DOE  that \ndetected  the  issue  shall  rectify  it  through  the  post-registration  change  process  in \naccordance with the activity cycle procedure. \n\n267.  Where no specific means of verification are specified, the DOE should apply the standard \n\nauditing techniques described in paragraph 263 above. \n\n9.1.6.  Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests \n\n268. \n\nIf the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order \nto determine whether the implementation or the operation of the registered A6.4 PoA and \nthe included CPs, or the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, \nmeets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure \nthat  these  issues  are  accurately  identified,  formulated,  discussed  and  concluded  in the \nverification and certification report. \n\n269.  The DOE shall raise a CAR if one of the following situations occurs: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nNon-compliance with the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, \nthe applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory \ndocuments  is  found  in  monitoring  and  reporting  and  has  not  been  sufficiently \ndocumented  by  the  activity  participants,  or  if  the  evidence  provided  to  prove \nconformity is insufficient; \n\nModifications to the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 PoA or the \nincluded CPs, or the monitoring or GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, \nhave not been sufficiently documented by the activity participants; \n\nMistakes  have  been  made  by  the  activity  participants  in  applying  assumptions, \ndata  or  calculations  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals  that  will \nimpact the quantity of emission reductions or removals; \n\nIssues  identified  in  a  FAR  during the  previous  validation  or  verification  have  not \nbeen resolved by the activity participants. \n\n270.  The  DOE  shall  raise  a  CL  if  the  information  provided  by  the  activity  participants  is \ninsufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism \nrules and requirements have been met. \n\n271.  The  DOE  shall  raise  a  FAR  if  issues  related  to  monitoring  and  reporting  that  require \n\nattention and/or adjustment at the next verification are identified. \n\n55 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n272.  The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify \nthe monitoring report, or provide additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s \nconcerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs. \n\n273.  The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its verification and certification report. \nThis  reporting  shall  explain  the  issues  raised,  the  responses  provided  by  the  activity \nparticipants, the means of verification of such responses, and references to any resulting \nchanges in the monitoring report or its supporting documents. \n\n9.2.  Verification of compliance with specific requirements for issuance \n\n9.2.1.  General \n\n274.  The DOE shall determine, by following the general verification requirements referred to in \nsections 5 and 9.1 above, whether the monitoring complies with all relevant requirements \nfor monitoring as contained in the activity standard. \n\n275.  The DOE shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIdentify the included CPs that it shall consider for verification in accordance with \nthe  methods/procedure  to  be  used  and  specified  in  the  registered  PoA-DD  for \nverification  of  the  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals \nachieved by the CPs. If the registered A6.4 PoA has more than one host Party and \na host Party’s DNA withdraws its approval of the PoA and/or its authorization of \nthe activity participants, the DOE shall identify only the CPs that are unaffected by \nthe withdrawal; \n\nTake into account the possible existence of included CPs complying with different \nversions of the registered PoA-DD22 and the need to account for this in its sampling \napproach to ensure that a statistically sound sample of CPs from each version of \nthe PoA-DD is being verified; \n\n(c) \n\nSystematically verify and certify the correct implementation and operation of the \nrecord-keeping system. \n\n276.  The  DOE  shall  include  in  its  verification  and  certification  report  a  description  of  how  it \napplied the methods/procedures for the purpose of verification. The DOE shall include in \nits  verification  and  certification  report  a  description  of  the  on-site  inspection(s),  where \nconducted in accordance with paragraph 264 or 265 above.  \n\n277. \n\n278. \n\nIf the activity participants have prepared a single monitoring report for a monitoring period, \nthe DOE shall confirm that the monitoring report covers all CPs included in the registered \nA6.4  PoA  whose  crediting  periods  overlap  with  the  monitoring  period,  and  contains  all \nmonitoring results obtained during the monitoring period. \n\nIf the activity participants have prepared multiple monitoring reports for separate batches \nof CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA, the DOE shall confirm that all the monitoring \nreports contain mutually exclusive batches of CPs, have the same monitoring period, and \ncollectively  contain  all  monitoring  results  obtained  during  the  period,  and  that  each \n\n22  CPs complying with the pre- and post-update of the PoA-DD due to the renewal of the PoA period or \npost-registration changes during a PoA period have separate monitoring reports in accordance with the \nactivity standard. \n\n56 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nmonitoring report contains only monitoring results of the CPs that follow the same version \nof the PoA-DD. \n\n279.  The DOE shall confirm that monitoring periods have been consecutive. Further, the DOE \nshall  confirm  that  CPs  have  been  included  in  requests  for  issuance  of  A6.4ERs  in  a \nconsecutive manner; that is, when a CP has been covered in a request for issuance for a \nmonitoring  period,  the  DOE  shall  confirm  that  a  request  for  issuance  for  the  previous \nmonitoring period that covered the particular CP has been published. \n\n280.  Notwithstanding  paragraph  279  above,  if  the  registered  A6.4  PoA  applies  any  of  the \nmethodologies  listed  in  the  activity  standard  as  potentially  accruing  negative  emission \nreductions in a monitoring period, the DOE shall confirm that A6.4ERs have been issued \nfor all CPs included in the PoA for the previous monitoring period. \n\n281.  A request for issuance of A6.4ERs shall relate to the A6.4ERs certified. \n\n282.  The DOE shall confirm the compliance with the requirements on: \n\n(a) \n\nGeneral requirements, including on: \n\n(i) \n\nThe implementation and operation of the A6.4 PoA and the included CPs as \nper the description in the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs; \n\n(ii)  The continuous monitoring as per the registered monitoring plans; \n\n(iii)  The coverage of the monitoring period; \n\n(iv)  The  presentation  of  monitoring  results  by  year  of  occurrence  of  GHG \n\nemission reductions or net GHG removals; \n\n(v)  The preparation of monitoring reports in chronological order and separation \n\nof them by CPs that follow different versions of the PoA-DD; \n\n(vi)  The application of appropriate GWPs; \n\n(vii)  The maintenance of monitoring results; \n\n(viii)  The  maximum  annual  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \n\nremovals to be achieved by the PoA as approved by the host Party; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\nThe avoidance of double issuance; \n\nThe description of implemented PoA and included CPs; \n\nThe description of monitoring system; \n\nReversal related actions for component projects involving removals and emission \nreductions component projects with reversal risks; \n\nThe provision of data and parameters used; \n\nThe calculation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.; \n\nThe continuous engagement of stakeholders. \n\n283.  When verifying the compliance of the implementation and the operation of the registered \nA6.4  PoA  and  included  CPs  and  monitoring  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG \n\n57 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nremovals with the requirements for implementation, operation and monitoring referred to \nin  paragraph  282  above,  the  DOE  shall  additionally  follow  the  specific  guidance  on \nverification  regarding  some  of  these  requirements  provided  in  sections  9.2.2−9.2.11 \nbelow. \n\n284.  The DOE shall ensure before submitting the request for first issuance for the PoA that the \n\nhost Party statement of authorization of the use of A6.4ERs was provided.  \n\n9.2.2.  Avoidance of double issuance \n\n285.  The DOE shall determine whether the registered A6.4 PoA or any of the included CPs are \nalso  registered,  or  covered  by  a  programme,  under  any  other  international,  regional, \nnational or subnational GHG mitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance \nbased  on  the  confirmation  from  such  other  crediting  scheme,  if  applicable,  public \ninformation and any other information obtained from the activity participants. \n\n286. \n\nIf  the  DOE  determines  that  the  registered  A6.4  PoA  or  any  of  the  included  CPs  are \nregistered, or covered by a programme, under another crediting scheme, the DOE shall \nadditionally determine whether the activity participants have obtained a confirmation from \nthe other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals \nbeing requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have not been or will not be credited under the \nother crediting scheme. \n\n9.2.3.  Compliance of the monitoring report with the monitoring report form \n\n287.  The DOE shall  determine  whether  the monitoring report  was  completed using  the valid \n\nversion of the applicable monitoring report form. \n\n288.  The DOE shall state its opinion on the compliance of the monitoring report with the relevant \n\nform and instructions therein. \n\n9.2.4.  Compliance  of  the  programme  implementation  with the  registered  programme  of \n\nactivity design document \n\n289.  The  DOE  shall  identify  any  concerns  related  to  the  conformity  of  the  implemented \nregistered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs and their operations with the registered PoA-\nDD and CP-DDs and determine whether: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe PoA and the CPs have been implemented and are operating in accordance \nwith the descriptions contained in the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs; or \n\nAny deviation or the proposed or actual changes in the implementation or operation \nof the  PoA  and/or  the  CPs  comply  with the relevant requirements  in the  activity \nstandard, or \n\nThe  sum  of  the  amount  of  GHG  emission  reductions  or  net  GHG  removals \nrequested for issuance and the cumulative amount of GHG emission reductions or \nnet  GHG  removals  already  issued  for  the  PoA  are  up  to  the  maximum  annual \namount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by the host \nParty.  \n\n290.  By  means  of  an  on-site  inspection  or  other  means  of  verification  in  accordance  with \nparagraph  264  or  265  above,  the  DOE  shall  assess  that  all  physical  features  (e.g. \ntechnology, project equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the included \n\n58 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nCPs specified in the CP-DDs are in place and that the activity participants are operating \nthe registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs as per the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs. \nIf an on-site inspection is not conducted, the DOE shall justify the rationale for the decision. \n\n291.  For each monitoring period, the DOE shall report: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe implementation status of the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs. For \nan  included  CP  that consists  of  more  than  one  site, the  DOE  shall  describe  the \nstatus of implementation and the starting date of operation for each site. For an \nincluded CP with phased implementation, the DOE shall state the progress of the \nproject achieved in each phase under verification. If the phased implementation is \ndelayed,  the  DOE  shall  describe  the  reasons  and  present  the  expected \nimplementation dates; \n\nThe actual operation of the included CPs; \n\nThe  information  (data  and  variables)  provided  in  the  monitoring  report  that  is \ndifferent from that stated in the registered PoA-DD or CP-DDs and has caused an \nincrease in the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  achieved by the \nincluded  CPs  in  the  current  monitoring  period  or  is  highly  likely  to  increase  the \nestimates in the future monitoring periods;23 \n\nAn opinion on the cause of any increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or \nnet GHG removals achieved by the included CPs in the current monitoring period \nthat was reported in monitoring report. \n\n9.2.5.  Compliance  of  the  registered  monitoring  plan  with  applied  methodologies  and \n\nstandardized baselines \n\n292.  The DOE shall determine whether the registered monitoring plans are in accordance with \nthe  applied  methodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines  and  the  other  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents based on the actual implementation of the CPs. \n\n293.  For monitoring aspects that are not specified in the applied methodologies, the applied \nstandardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the \nDOE should highlight issues which may enhance the level of accuracy and completeness \nof the registered monitoring plans. \n\n294.  The  DOE  shall  state  its  opinion  on  whether  the  registered  monitoring  plans  are  in \naccordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the \nother applied methodological regulatory documents. \n\n9.2.6.  Monitoring activities \n\n295.  The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring of parameters related to GHG emission \nreductions  or  net  GHG  removals  specified  in  the  CP-DDs  have  been  implemented  in \naccordance with the registered monitoring plans.  \n\n296.  The DOE shall determine whether: \n\n23  Discrepancies may include higher water availability than expected in  the CP-DD, which may increase \nthe  electricity  output  from  a  hydropower  plant,  or  a  higher  plant  load  factor  owing  to  higher  bagasse \navailability during the crushing season, which increases the production of steam and electricity. \n\n59 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nThe registered monitoring plans have been properly implemented and followed by \nthe activity participants; \n\nAll parameters stated in the registered monitoring plans have been monitored and \nupdated as applicable; \n\nThe equipment used for monitoring is controlled and calibrated in accordance with \nthe  registered  monitoring  plans, \nthe  applied \nstandardized  baselines, the  other  applied methodological  regulatory  documents, \nlocal/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification; \n\nthe  applied  methodologies, \n\nMonitoring results are consistently recorded as per the approved frequency; \n\nQuality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied in accordance \nwith the registered monitoring plans. \n\n297. \n\nIf the activity participants applied a sampling approach to determine data and parameters \nmonitored, the DOE shall assess the compliance of the sampling efforts and surveys with \nthe validated sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for \nA6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. \n\n298.  The DOE shall list each parameter required by the registered monitoring plans and state \nhow it verified the information flow (from data generation and aggregation, to recording, \ncalculation  and  reporting)  for  these  parameters,  including  the  values  in  the  monitoring \nreport. \n\n299.  For CPs involving removals and emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the DOE shall \ndetermine whether the monitoring report includes the following specific elements as per \nthe  activity  standard  and  the  respective  provisions  of  the  removals  standard  and  any \napplied methodological regulatory documents:  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nA description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  \n\nThe estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the \nmonitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty; \n\nData collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a \nsummary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed; \n\nRecords  and  logs  of  the  observed  events  of  GHG  release  that  potentially  could \nhave  led  to  the  reversal  of  removals  and/or  emission  reductions  along  with  a \nsummary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period \ncovered by the monitoring report; \n\nInformation on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent \nwith the risk mitigation measures described in the registered CP-DD; \n\nInformation  on  how  any  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  have  been \nassessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the \nregistered CP-DD.  \n\n9.2.7.  Calibration frequency for measuring instruments \n\n300.  The DOE shall determine whether the calibration of the measuring equipment that has an \nimpact on the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the included \n\n60 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nCPs  is  conducted  by  the  activity  participants  at  the  frequency  specified  in  the  applied \nmethodologies,  the  applied  standardized  baselines,  the  other  applied  methodological \nregulatory documents or the registered monitoring plans. \n\n301. \n\nIf,  during  the  verification  for  a  certain  monitoring  period,  the  DOE  identifies  that  the \ncalibration  has  been  delayed  and  the  calibration  has  been  implemented  after  the \nmonitoring  period  in  consideration  (i.e.  the  results  of  delayed  calibration  are  available), \nreferring to the illustrative examples in Appendix 2, the DOE may conclude its verification, \nprovided  the  following  conservative  approach  is  adopted  in  the  calculation  of  GHG \nemission reductions or net GHG removals: \n\n(a) \n\nApplying  the  maximum  permissible  error24  of  the  instrument  to  the  measured \nvalues taken during the period between the scheduled date of calibration and the \nactual date of calibration, if the results of the delayed calibration do not show any \nerrors  in  the  measuring  equipment,  or  if  the  error  is  smaller  than  the  maximum \npermissible error; or \n\n(b) \n\nApplying the error identified in the delayed calibration test, if the error is beyond \nthe maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment. \n\n302.  The DOE shall confirm that the error has been applied: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIn a conservative manner, such that the adjusted measured values of the delayed \ncalibration shall result in fewer GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that \nare deemed achieved by the included CPs; \n\nFor all measured values taken  during the period between the scheduled date of \ncalibration and the actual date of calibration. \n\nIf the results of the delayed calibration are not available, or the calibration has not been \nconducted at the time of the verification, the DOE, prior to finalizing the verification, shall \nrequest  the  activity  participants  to  conduct  the  required  calibration  and shall  determine \nwhether  the  activity  participants  have  calculated GHG  emission  reductions  or  net GHG \nremovals conservatively using the approach mentioned in paragraph 301 above. \n\nIf  the  DOE  determines  that  it  is  not  possible  for  the  activity  participants  to  conduct  the \ncalibration  at  the  frequency  specified  in  the  applied  methodologies,  the  applied \nstandardized  baselines,  the  other  applied  methodological  regulatory  documents  or  the \nregistered monitoring plans due to reasons beyond the control of the activity participants,25 \nthe DOE shall follow the applicable requirements related to post-registration changes in \nsection 8 above. \n\nIf neither the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied \nmethodological  regulatory  documents  nor  the  registered  monitoring  plans  specify  any \nrequirements  for  calibration  frequency  for  the  measuring  equipment,  the  DOE  shall \ndetermine whether the equipment is calibrated either in accordance with the specifications \nof  the  local/national  standards  or  as  per  the  manufacturer’s  specification.  If  neither \nlocal/national standards nor the manufacturer’s specification are available, the DOE shall \n\n303. \n\n304. \n\n305. \n\n24  The  maximum  permissible  errors  of  all  the  measuring  instruments  are  specified  by  the  respective \n\nmanufacturers as part of their technical specifications. \n\n25  For example, due to the contractual terms between the activity participant and purchasing/selling entities. \n\n61 of 74 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\ndetermine whether the equipment is calibrated in accordance with the specifications of the \ninternational standards. \n\n9.2.8.  Reversal related actions for component projects involving removals and emission \n\nreductions component projects with reversal risks \n\n306. \n\n307. \n\nIn cases of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that could potentially \nlead  to  reversal,  the  DOE  shall  determine  on  the  basis  of  transparent  and  verifiable \nevidence  whether  the  event  as  per  the  preliminary  assessment  report,  prepared  in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  activity  standard,  respective  provisions  of  the \nremovals  standard  on  reversal-related  actions  and  any  other  relevant  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents, results in an actual reversal or not.   \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  does  not  approve  the  preliminary  assessment  report,  or  if  the \npreliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual \nreversal  and  a  monitoring  report  is  prepared,  the  DOE  shall  determine  whether  the \nmonitoring  report  is  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  activity  standard, \nrespective  provisions  of  the  removals  standard  and  any  other  relevant  applied \nmethodological regulatory documents.  \n\n308.  The  DOE  shall  also  assess  whether  the  monitoring  report  accurately  estimates  the \n\nmagnitude of reversals and correctly characterizes them as avoidable or unavoidable.  \n\n309.  The DOE shall also assess whether following the submission of the monitoring report: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe risk assessment of the affected CPs has been updated and the risk rating of \nthe affected CPs has been revised; \n\nThe compliance with requirements and safeguards contained in the A6.4 SD Tool, \ntaking into account any negative environmental and social impacts caused by the \nreversal  and  plans  developed  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of  such  negative \nenvironmental and social impacts, has been reviewed.  \n\n9.2.9.

Guidance  on \n\nremote \nalternative means to an on-site inspection \n\ninspection  as  an \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nIn this document, a remote inspection for the purpose of validation or verification refers to \nthe  component  projects  (CPs)  for  which  the  validation  or  verification  team  of  the \ndesignated operational entity (DOE) carries out the same activities as in a physical on-site \ninspection through information and communication technology (ICT) tools. \n\nThere are risks posed by remote inspections, including in the use of ICT tools. In order to \nensure a level of assurance of the validation or verification that is comparable to the level \nof an on-site inspection, there needs to be measures in place to reduce these risks. \n\nThe DOE should identify risks pertaining to the remote inspection for each validation or \nverification activity and establish and implement measures to eliminate or reduce those \nrisks.  A  DOE  should  also  integrate  this  risk  assessment  process  into  its  quality \nmanagement systems. \n\nThe  DOE  should  implement  the  following  actions  at  different  stages  of  a  validation  or \nverification activity: \n\n(a) \n\nRisk assessment stage: The feasibility of conducting a remote inspection depends \non  the  risk  level  and  whether  measures  to  eliminate  or  reduce  the  risks  are \nadequate  for  the  validation  or  verification.  Therefore,  a  risk  assessment  to  be \nconducted by the DOE should cover the following aspects: \n\n(i) \n\nIdentifying and assessing the risks inherent in a remote inspection. The risks \nmay be at different levels and could cover different aspects; hence the risk \nidentification and assessment should cover: \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nRisks related to organizational and procedural aspects, which include \ngeneric risks. These risks could relate to the following: the quality of \nthe  Internet  connection;  the  quality  of  ICT  tools  such  as  good \ncamerawork to ensure a reasonably good view for the validation or \nverification  team;  the  amount  of  documentation  to  be  reviewed \nremotely; whether relevant data flows can be accessed remotely; the \nrecord-keeping system established; the maintaining of confidentiality \nand  personnel  data  protection;  and  the  required  competence  and \nresources of the validation or verification team; \n\nRisks  related  to  the  project  and  its  configuration,  which  present \nproject-specific risks. The risks could relate to the following: whether \nthe boundary and features of the project can be evaluated remotely; \nwhether the remote inspection would enable the DOE to observe any \nsources of emissions that are not included in the project; how control \nactivities are carried out; and how calculations are tracked and cross-\nchecked; \n\nRisks  related  to  monitoring  aspects.  The  risks  could  relate  to  the \nfollowing:  the  complexity  of  the  monitoring  parameters  and  the \nmonitoring  plan;  data  processing  and  reporting;  whether  a  fiscal \nmetering  method  is  applied;  the  sampling  or  surveys  conducted  at \nhousehold  level;  the  status  of  the  monitoring  period  being  verified; \n\n71 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nand  whether  data  and  information  have  been  thoroughly  checked \nduring  previous  verifications  or  whether  such  data  and  information \ncan be checked subsequently without an on-site inspection; \n\n(ii)  Establishing measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. The DOE \nshould establish measures to eliminate or reduce each identified risk at the \ndifferent levels described in subparagraph (i) above; \n\n(iii)  The risk assessment pertaining to the remote inspection may be undertaken \nin the context of the application of materiality following the relevant provisions \nin this standard; \n\n(b) \n\nPlanning  stage:  Based  on  risk  assessment  outcomes,  the  DOE  should  plan  the \nvalidation or verification activity as follows: \n\n(i)  Composing  a  validation  or  verification  team  with  sufficient  members  that \nhave the knowledge, skill and solid professional judgment required in an on-\nsite  inspection  in  conjunction  with  additional  competence  in  applying  ICT \ntools; \n\n(ii)  Conducting  a  desk  review  to  gain  a  prior  understanding  of  records  and \n\ndocumentation control processes of the activity participants; \n\n(iii)  Establishing a validation or verification plan to clearly define the tasks to be \nperformed during the remote inspection, taking into account the established \nmeasures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. This includes a detailed \nallocation  of  responsibilities  by  different  validation  or  verification  team \nmembers with the required knowledge and specific time zones to ensure the \nteam members audit separately and make the best use of time; \n\n(iv)  Determining ICT tools to be used with the activity participants and conducting \na test on the agreed ICT tools before the remote inspection to ensure that \nthere is a stable connection and understanding of how to use such ICT tools. \nThe DOE should also ensure that there is a backup plan in case there is a \nconnection issue; \n\n(c) \n\nImplementation stage: During the remote inspection, the DOE should implement \nmeasures it has established to mitigate the identified risks, while conducting the \nvalidation or verification following the relevant requirements of this standard. At this \nstage, the DOE may decide to extend or terminate the remote inspection if it finds \nduring the remote inspection that the actual risks are higher than initially assessed. \n\n(d) \n\nPost-remote inspection stage: The DOE should: \n\n(i) \n\nAssess  whether  another  round  of  remote  inspection  is  needed  while \nreviewing  the  activity  participants’  response  to  clarification  requests, \ncorrective action requests and/or forward action requests; \n\n(ii)  Ensure that its technical review process is able to identify any risks that were \n\nnot identified during the risk assessment stage. \n\n72 of 74 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-AC-005 \nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities \nVersion 02.0 \n\nAppendix 2.

Mechanism methodologies are intended to provide the basis for claim and assessment of \ncreditable  emission  reductions  or  removals,  and  whether  activities  satisfy  additionality \nrequirements, and all relevant RMP and guidance from the SBM. \n\n11. \n\n12. \n\n13. \n\n14. \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\nParagraph  33  of  the  RMP  applies  to  methodologies,  and  it  is  relevant  to,  inter  alia, \nbaseline-setting,  the  avoidance  of  leakage,  and  the  demonstration  of  additionality  of \nactivities. \n\nParagraph  34  of  the  RMP  sets  out  additional  requirements,  including  with  respect  to \npolicies, national circumstances and reversals. \n\nParagraph  35  of  the  RMP  frames  the  basic  procedures  for  the  development  of \nmethodologies by host Parties, the Supervisory Body and activity participants. \n\nParagraph 36 of the RMP provides a choice of approaches for the baseline-setting and \nrequires  the  justification  of  the  choice(s)  made,  including  demonstration  of  consistency \nwith paragraph 33 of the RMP. \n\nParagraph 37 provides for host Parties and the Supervisory Body to develop standardized \nbaselines consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP. \n\nParagraph 38 of the RMP applies to the demonstration of additionality of activities and \nidentifies specific tests. \n\n4.1.  Encouraging ambition over time \n\n17. \n\nParagraph  33  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  encourage \nambition over time (…)”. \n\n18.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  apply  increasingly  ambitious  baselines  to  encourage \nambition of activities over time, while taking into account host Party circumstances and \nshould facilitate the deployment of low carbon solutions and technologies as described in \nparagraphs 19 and 20 below. \n\n19.  Mechanism methodologies should facilitate the deployment of technologies or measures \nthat are not widely used or available in specific locations, to facilitate knowledge transfer \nand  encourage  deployment  of  technologies  or  measures  that  reduce  the  cost  of \ndecarbonization and unlock investment in low-carbon solutions. \n\n20.  Mechanism  methodologies  should  contain  provisions  that  facilitate  the  inclusion  of \nprogressively  more  efficient  and  less  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)-intensive  technologies, \nreplicable and scalable mitigation activities, expanding the user base, broader geographic \ncoverage, and greater penetration of low-carbon solutions after initial deployment. \n\n4 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n4.2.  Being real, transparent, conservative, credible \n\n21. \n\nParagraph  33  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  (…)  be  real, \ntransparent, conservative, credible (…)”. \n\n22.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  credible  methods  for  estimating  emission \nreductions or removals to ensure that the results of Article 6.4 activities represent actual \ntonnes of GHG emissions reduced or removed. Such estimations shall be based on up-\nto-date scientific information and reliable data. \n\n23.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require transparent descriptions \nof the sources of data used, the assumptions made, the references used and the steps \nfollowed in the estimation of the results of Article 6.4 activities, including equations where \nnecessary. \n\n24.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that ensure conservative estimation of \nemission  reductions  or  removals  from  the  measures  applied,  options  chosen,  or \nassumptions  made,  and  which  should  result  in  conservative  estimates  of  the  emission \nreductions or removals from Article 6.4 activities. \n\n25.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that Article 6.4 activities \nhave a robust monitoring, data capture and reporting system to ensure credibility. Where \nsecondary data is used, mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require \nactivity participants to provide justification that the source of data is appropriate, and the \ndata are conservative. \n\n26.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to ensure that all emission reductions \n\nor removals, are real, transparent, conservative, and credible by: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nIncluding  robust,  transparent  and  user-friendly  measurement,  reporting  and \nindependent third-party verification systems; \n\nRequiring the use of technical performance standards that are data driven; \n\nRequiring transparent demonstration of changes in GHG emissions showing each \nstep  in  calculations  and  the  results,  and  ensuring  that  calculated  emission \nreductions or removals are uniquely achieved by and attributable to the activity; \n\nAdopting life cycle approaches and considering emissions embodied in materials \nand products, where relevant and practicable; \n\nEnsuring  that  information,  including  data  sources  and  calculations  are  real, \ntransparent, conservative, accessible and credible; \n\nChoosing a conservative emissions baseline when multiple sources of data and \nparameters are available to set the baseline; \n\nIncluding, where appropriate, the use of remote sensing and digital technologies \nto enable transparent, accurate and credible calculation and estimation of emission \nreductions and removals. \n\n4.3.  Establishing that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual \n\n27. \n\nParagraph  33  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  (…)  be  below \n‘business as usual’ (…)”. \n\n5 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n28.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that the baseline selected \nfor an emission reduction activity in accordance with paragraph 36 of the RMP shall be \ndemonstrated  as  being  below  ‘business-as-usual’  (BAU).  BAU  emissions  are  plausible \nreference benchmarks or scenarios for GHG emissions prior to or in the absence of the \nimplementation of the activity. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall require \nthe identification of the BAU scenario or reference benchmark emissions and provide an \napproach for their estimation. \n\n29.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  provisions  that  require  activity  participants  to \ncalculate  the  difference  between  the  baseline  emissions  estimated  as  per  the \nrequirements  in  section  4.6  below  and  BAU  emissions  estimated  as  per  paragraph  28 \nabove as an annual and total amount with respect to the crediting period. This shall be \ndemonstrated in the project design document and at each renewal of the crediting period. \n\n4.4.  Contributing  to  the  equitable  sharing  of  mitigation  benefits  between \n\nparticipating Parties \n\n30. \n\nParagraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall…contribute to the \nequitable sharing of mitigation benefits between the participating Parties…”. \n\n31.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  provisions  for  contributing  to  the  equitable \nsharing  of  mitigation  benefits  between  participating  Parties,  including  the  application  of \nconditions  specified  by  the  Designated  National  Authorities  (DNAs)  of  the  host  Party. \nThese may also include one or more of the provisions below: \n\n(a) \n\nConditions to ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) of activities is \nshorter than the lifetime of the technology implemented including any replacements \nundertaken during the crediting period, where there is very high confidence that \nemission reductions from the technology continue to be achieved beyond the end \nof crediting period(s); \n\n(b) \n\nOther  approaches  to  fulfil  the  demonstration  of  equitable  sharing  of  mitigation \nbenefits. \n\n32.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  include  provisions  that  ensure  that  the  sharing  of \nmitigation  benefits  between  participating  Parties  tangibly  supports  the  sustainable \ndevelopment  objectives of  host  Parties,  such  as  through  the  use  of  the SD  Tool  in  the \nactivity design and implementation. \n\n33.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  the  estimation  of  the  mitigation  benefits  to  the \n\nhost Party, taking into account the relevant provisions in paragraph 31 above. \n\n4.5.  Aligning with the NDC of each participating Party, if applicable, its LT-LEDS, \nif  it  has  submitted  one,  the  long-term  temperature  goal  of  the  Paris \nAgreement and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement \n\n34. \n\nParagraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) in respect of \neach participating Party, contribute to reducing emission levels in the host Party, and align \nwith its NDC, if applicable, its long-term low GHG emission development strategy, if it has \nsubmitted one, and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement”. \n\n35. \n\nParagraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) align with the \nlong-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (…)”. \n\n6 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n36.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  demonstration  that  the  activity,  does  not \nconstrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party \nwith  regard  to  the  latest  nationally  determined  contribution  (NDC)  of  the  host  Party,  if \napplicable,  its  long-term  low  greenhouse  gas  emission  development  strategies  (LT-\nLEDS), if it has submitted one, and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement \nand long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. \n\n4.6.  Approaches to set the baseline \n\n37. \n\nParagraph 36 of the RMP states that: “Each mechanism methodology shall require the \napplication  of  one  of  the  approach(es)  below  to  setting  the  baseline,  while  taking  into \naccount  any  guidance  by  the  Supervisory  Body,  and  with  justification  for  the \nappropriateness  of  the  choices,  including  information  on  how  the  proposed  baseline \napproach is consistent with paragraphs 33 and 35 in the RMP and recognizing that a host \nParty may determine a more ambitious level at its discretion: \n\nA performance-based approach, taking into account: \n\n(i)  Best  available  technologies  that  represent  an  economically  feasible  and \nenvironmentally sound course of action, where appropriate; \n\n(ii)  An  ambitious  benchmark  approach  where  the  baseline  is  set  at  least  at  the \naverage  emission  level  of  the  best  performing  comparable  activities  providing \nsimilar  outputs  and  services  in  a  defined  scope  in  similar  social,  economic, \nenvironmental and technological circumstances; \n\n(iii)  An  approach  based  on  existing  actual  or  historical  emissions,  adjusted \ndownwards to ensure alignment with paragraph 33 of the RMP.” \n\n38. \n\nParagraph 27 of the RMP states that “A host Party may specify to the Supervisory Body, \nprior to participating in the mechanism: (a) Baseline approaches and other methodological \nrequirements…”. \n\n39.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  provisions  that  require  justification  of  the \nappropriateness of the choice of approach(es) identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP for \nsetting the baseline, with reference to the requirements of paragraphs 33 and 35 of the \nRMP. \n\n40.  With regard to setting the baseline for emission reduction activities, factors affecting the \n\nappropriateness of the choice may include: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nSimilarity of emission sources with respect to technologies and measures applied, \nor sectors covered by the methodology which may allow the use of an ambitious \nbenchmark covered under paragraph 36 (ii) of the RMP; \n\nAvailability  of  data  required  for  a  conservative  and  reliable  estimation  of  the \nbaseline. \n\n41. \n\nFor  the  approaches  identified  in  paragraph  36  of  the  RMP,  mechanism  methodologies \nshall contain provisions to apply the method detailed in section 4.7 below to adjust the \nbaseline emissions downwards and to ensure consistency with paragraph 33 of the RMP. \n\n42. \n\nA host Party may determine a more ambitious baseline requirement at its discretion and \nspecify it to the Supervisory Body for approval. \n\n7 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n4.7.  Addressing elements of paragraph 33 and paragraph 36 of the RMP \n\n43.  Mechanism methodologies shall address consistency of implementation of paragraph 36 \nof the RMP with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP through the appropriate \napplication of: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDownward adjustment to the baseline as per paragraph 36 (iii) of the RMP; and/or \n\nDownward adjustment to the baseline resulting from or applied to the approaches \nin  paragraph  36  (i)  and  (ii)  of  the  RMP,  unless  otherwise  decided  by  the \nSupervisory Body. \n\nIf the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above demonstrates a downward adjustment \nthat is greater than the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, no further \nadjustment is required. Where the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above is less than \nthe adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, further adjustment is required \nto  align  with  the  result  of  paragraphs  45  to  47  below  to  ensure  consistency  with  the \nrequirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP. \n\nFactors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment of baselines shall be included \nin the project design document and updated at each renewal of the crediting period, in \naccordance  with  paragraphs  46  to  47  below.  Host  Parties  may  decide  to  apply  more \nstringent  factors  or  quantitative  methods  for  downward  adjustment,  according  to  their \ncircumstances. \n\nThe  downward  adjustment  shall  be  undertaken  in  a  manner  that  considers  economic \nviability  of  critical  mitigation  activities,  large-scale  transformation  and  decarbonization \ntechnologies,  negative  emission  approaches  while  ensuring  that  methodologies  are \naligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. \n\n44. \n\n45. \n\n46. \n\n47. \n\nThe  downward  adjustment  to  the  baseline  referred  to  above  may  be  operationalized \nthrough: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nFactors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies approved \nby the Supervisory Body. These may be developed by all participants covered in \ndecision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 35. Activity participants or stakeholders may propose \nfactors or  quantitative methods for  the consideration  of  the Supervisory  Body in \nconsultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being involved. If \na country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the procedures \nfor the standardized baselines shall be applied; \n\nDevelopment of factors or quantitative methods, jointly by the Supervisory Body \nand the host Party, with the provision for the host Party to make a request to the \nSupervisory Body to initiate the development of the factors or quantitative methods. \nThe procedures for the standardized baselines may be used for this purpose; or \n\nDevelopment of factors or quantitative methods by the host Party that are specified \nto  the  Supervisory  Body  for  approval.  The  procedures  for  the  standardized \nbaselines may be used for this purpose. \n\n4.8.  Encouraging broad participation \n\n48. \n\nParagraph  33  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  (…)  encourage \nbroad participation (…)”. \n\n8 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n49. \n\n50. \n\nThe Supervisory Body shall encourage development of  methodologies covering a wide \nrange  of  emission  reduction  and  removal  activities  with  broad  sectoral  and  geographic \ncoverage. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  shall  encourage  participation  of  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders \nduring  the  methodology  development  process  and  the  methodology  application  by \nenabling informed consultation as described in the “Procedure: Development, revision and \nclarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. \n\n51.  Mechanism methodologies shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nContain  provisions  that  uphold  stringency  and  encourage  broad  participation  by \nbeing accurate, simple, clear, and avoiding complexity such that a wide range of \nactivity  participants  and  host  Parties  can  apply  the  methodology  requirements \nirrespective  of  a  Party’s  scientific \nfinancial  and  national \ncircumstances; \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nContain provisions that take into account the context on the ground in host Parties, \nparticularly in least developed countries and small island developing States; \n\nContain  provisions  that  take  into  account  the  knowledge  and  practices  of  local \ncommunities and Indigenous Peoples; \n\nPermit  the  use  of  multiple  data  sources  to  address  data  gaps,  and  the  use  of \nconservative  default  values  and/or  use  of  benchmarked  data  from  comparable \nregions to the extent they can be applicable; \n\nUse simple language that is inclusive, gender-sensitive, and accessible to a wide \nrange of stakeholders, including local communities and Indigenous Peoples to the \nextent possible. \n\n4.9. \n\nIncluding  data  sources,  accounting  for  uncertainty  and  monitoring \nrequirements \n\n52. \n\n53. \n\nParagraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall include relevant \nassumptions, parameters, data sources and key factors (…)”. \n\nThe Supervisory Body shall ensure that mechanism methodologies are transparent and \ncomprehensible with respect to included assumptions, parameters, data sources and key \nfactors. \n\n54.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  or  reference  provisions  that  require  the \naccounting  of  uncertainty  associated  with  emission  factors,  activity  data  and  other \nestimation  parameters  applied  in  the  calculation  of  emission  reductions  or  removals \nconsistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. \n\n55.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions requiring a listing of data parameters \nthat need to be monitored throughout the crediting period. This may include the data that \nare directly measured where necessary on a sample basis, and the data that are collected \nfrom  other  sources  such  as  official  statistics,  expert  judgment,  IPCC  guidelines,  and \nscientific literature. In this regard, methodologies shall contain provisions on monitoring \nplans related to the collection, open publication and storing of all relevant data needed to \nestimate baseline, project and leakage emissions, including provisions related to quality \nassurance and quality control. \n\n9 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n4.10.  Recognizing suppressed demand \n\n56. \n\n57. \n\n58. \n\nParagraph  33  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  (…)  recognize \nsuppressed demand (…)”. \n\nSuppressed demand in the context of an Article 6.4 activity is a situation where services \nprovided to a population are insufficient to meet the basic human needs such as minimum \namount of electricity for lighting, heating or cooling due to barriers, including low income \nor lack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting such \nneeds requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline scenarios. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  will  recognize  suppressed  demand  under  a  situation  where  the \nBAU cannot realistically provide the level of service required of the Article 6.4 activity by \nconsidering that the baseline scenario is not set based on the historical and continuation \nof the current condition, but rather based on an alternative that provides a level of service \ncomparable to that provided by the Article 6.4 activity. \n\n59. \n\nThe Supervisory Body shall recognize suppressed demand by including benchmarks and \ndefault factors in specific methodologies that may not be below BAU. \n\n4.11.  Taking into account policies and measures and relevant circumstances \n\n60. \n\nParagraph  34  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  (…)  take  into \naccount  (…)  policies  and  measures,  and  relevant  circumstances,  including  national, \nregional or local, social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances (…)”. \n\n61.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  provisions  to  take  into  account  relevant \ncircumstances, including national, regional, or local, social, economic, environmental and \ntechnological, based on robust data and verifiable information. In this regard, the type of \ndata  and  information  that  would  be  necessary  to  meet  the  above  provisions  shall  be \nspecified in the methodologies, particularly with regard to eligibility conditions, setting the \nbaseline, and demonstrating additionality. \n\n4.12.  Standardized baselines \n\n62. \n\n63. \n\n64. \n\nParagraph 37 of the RMP states that “Standardized baselines may be developed by the \nSupervisory Body at the request of the host Party or may be developed by the host Party \nand approved by the Supervisory Body. Standardized baselines shall be established at \nthe highest possible level of aggregation in the relevant sector of the host Party and be \nconsistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP.” \n\nA standardized baseline is a baseline developed at the request of or by a host Party or a \ngroup of host Parties on a subnational, national, or group-of-Parties basis rather than on \nan  activity  basis  to  facilitate  the  determination  of  the  baseline,  calculation  of  the  GHG \nemission reductions or removals and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 \nactivities,  while  ensuring  environmental  integrity  within  the  scope  of  the  standardized \nbaseline. \n\nThe application of standardized baselines is not mandatory unless explicitly stated in an \napproved  standardized  baseline  or  in  another  standard  approved  by  the  Supervisory \nBody.  When  the  application  of  a  standardized  baseline  is  not  mandatory,  activity \nparticipants may establish additionality or baseline emissions for their activity using other \napproved approaches as an alternative to applying a standardized baseline. \n\n10 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n65. \n\n66. \n\n67. \n\n68. \n\n69. \n\n70. \n\nA  host  Party  may  specify  the  application  of  a  standardized  baseline  as  a  mandatory \nrequirement for the activities implemented in the host Party. The Supervisory Body may \nalso specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory requirement for \ncertain cases such as when the standardized baseline is being used to address leakage \nemissions  of  an  activity,  as  further  detailed  in  section  6  below.  The  provisions  in  this \nparagraph may also apply to standardized baselines developed by or for a group of host \nParties. \n\nThe approaches for setting the baselines referred to in section 4.6 above shall also be \napplied for the development of standardized baselines. \n\nThe host Party and the Supervisory Body should determine the level of aggregation taking \ninto account the following: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nA default level of aggregation shall comprise the facilities or equipment producing \na  similar  type  of  output  within  the  geographical  boundaries  of  one  Party  or  a \nspecific  subregion  determined  by  the  Party.  The  level  of  aggregation  may  be \nexpanded to a group of Parties with similar circumstances relating to the output; \n\nA default group of facilities should be disaggregated when significant dissimilarities \nexist in the performance of facilities or groups of facilities in the country/region. In \nthis  case,  the  disaggregation  shall  be  carried  out  according  to  relevant  criteria, \nsuch as scale of production, installed capacity or age of the facilities. Standardized \nbaseline  values  should  be  determined  for  each  group  of  similar  facilities  in  this \ncase; \n\n(a) \n\nDisaggregation  should  not  result  in  standardized  baselines  with  overlapping \napplicability. \n\nStandardized baselines shall include a default validity period of three years, starting from \nthe  date  of  approval  by  the  Supervisory  Body.  A  host  Party  may  propose  a  shorter  or \nlonger validity period, taking into account the specificity of sectors in which activities are \nundertaken, and by providing justification for the consideration of the Supervisory Body. \n\nAfter  the  validity  of  a  standardized  baseline  has  expired,  the  updated  standardized \nbaseline can be submitted by the host Party for the consideration of the Supervisory Body \nfor  approval.  An  updated  standardized  baseline  shall  not  impact  registered  activities \napplying the previous version up to the end of their current crediting period. \n\nStandardized  baselines  may  be  developed  by  the  host  Party  and  approved  by  the \nSupervisory  Body  following  an  assessment  against  the  “Procedure:  Development, \nrevision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. \n\n5.  Additionality demonstration \n\n71. \n\nParagraph  38  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Each  mechanism  methodology  shall  specify  the \napproach  to  demonstrating  the  additionality  of  the  activity.  Additionality  shall  be \ndemonstrated using a robust assessment that shows the activity would not have occurred \nin  the  absence  of  the  incentives  from  the  mechanism,  taking  into  account  all  relevant \nnational  policies,  including  legislation,  and  representing  mitigation  that  exceeds  any \nmitigation that is required by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that \navoids  locking  in  levels  of  emissions,  technologies  or  carbon-intensive  practices \nincompatible with paragraph 33 of the RMP”. \n\n11 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n72. \n\nParagraph  39  of  the  RMP  states  that  “The  Supervisory  Body  may  apply  simplified \napproaches  for  demonstration  of  additionality  for  any  least  developed  country  or  small \nisland  developing  State  at  the  request  of  that  Party,  in  accordance  with  requirements \ndeveloped by the Supervisory Body”. \n\n73.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to demonstrate additionality through; \nprior consideration of the benefits of the mechanism, regulatory analysis, the avoidance \nof lock-in as well as through financial additionality complemented with a common practice \nanalysis. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in \nparagraph 77 below. \n\n74. \n\n75. \n\n76. \n\nDemonstration  of  the  consideration  of  the  benefits  from  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  as \nnecessary in the decision to implement the activity shall be performed in accordance with \nthe Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects. \n\nRegulatory  analysis  shall  require  demonstration  that  the  proposed  activity  represents \nmitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or regulation unless the law \nor  regulation  refers  to  or  formally  integrates  the  mechanism  as  an  instrument  for \nimplementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity that may require a \ncertain technological, performance or management action shall be considered, noting that \nregulatory environments vary. \n\nAvoidance of lock-in shall require demonstration that the proposed activity avoids locking \nin  levels  of  emissions,  technologies  or  carbon-intensive  practices  incompatible  with \nparagraph  33  of  the  RMP,  including  through  an  assessment  of  the  scale,  lifetime,  and \nemissions intensity of the activity; \n\n77. \n\nFinancial additionality can be proved either by: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDemonstration that the proposed activity would not have occurred in the absence \nof  the  incentives  from  the  mechanism  through  an  investment  analysis  (default \napproach); or \n\nAssessment of barriers to the implementation of the activity, such as financial and \ninstitutional  barriers,  first  of  its  kind,  taking  into  account  all  relevant  national \npolicies,  including  legislation  and  current  practices  within  the  activity  sector  and \ngeographic area including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws. \nTo  demonstrate  additionality  for  their  activity,  through  barrier  analysis,  activity \nparticipants shall: \n\n(i)  Describe the barriers, including the reasons why investment analysis is not \n\nsufficient; and \n\n(ii)  Evidence  the  barriers  and  how  the  mechanism  will  help  overcome  the \n\nbarriers. \n\n(c) \n\nA common practice analysis to complement the investment and barrier analysis by \ndemonstrating that the measure or technology is not already widespread through \nan analysis of the extent to which the proposed project type (e.g. technology or \npractice) has already diffused in the relevant sector and region. \n\n78. \n\nPerformance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in paragraph \n77 above, subject to applicability conditions. The use of such approaches by an activity \nshall require demonstration of the following, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\nthe use of baseline approach(es) in paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) of the RMPs; \n\n12 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(b) \n\nthat the technologies or practices applied in the activity outperform an ambitious \nthreshold  for  emissions  or  emissions  reductions,  market  penetration,  or  other \nunique characteristics, set at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the \nRMPs. \n\n79.  When  formulating  an  approach  to  demonstrate  the  additionality,  the  Supervisory  Body \nshall take into account any communication from the host Party regarding paragraph 80 \nbelow. \n\n80.  When  formulating  an  approach  to  the  demonstration  of  additionality,  including  for \nthe  relevant \nparagraph  76  above,  mechanism  methodologies  should  consider \ncircumstances, including national, regional or local, social, economic, environmental and \ntechnological circumstances, in line with paragraphs 60 and 61 above, including Party-led \nidentification of activities that may be transformative. \n\n6.  Leakage \n\n81. \n\n82. \n\nParagraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) avoid leakage, \nwhere applicable (…)”. \n\nLeakage refers to anthropogenic emissions by sources of GHGs that occur outside the \nactivity boundary which are attributable to the Article 6.4 activity. \n\n83.  Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nEnsure that the potential sources of leakage in activities covered by a mechanism \nmethodology are identified, including, but not limited to, any sources referred to in \nparagraph 84 below; \n\nRequire  activities  to  avoid  or  minimize  all  sources  of  leakage  by  applying  the \nappropriate approach(es) referred to in paragraph 85 below, including addressing \nany remaining leakage by discounting credited volumes as described in paragraph \n85(a) below; \n\nRequire  that  activity  participants  list  all  potential  sources  of  leakage  that  may \nreasonably  be  attributable  to  the  activity  and  describe  how  each  is  being \naddressed.  If  the  activity  participant  excludes  any  source  of  leakage  from \nconsideration, they shall justify its exclusion; \n\nInclude  provisions  for  robust,  transparent  and  user-friendly  measurement, \nreporting and independent third-party verification systems that encompass specific \nsources of potential leakage identified; \n\nInclude, where necessary, life cycle analysis of products or material in relation to \nthe source indicated in paragraph 84(d) below; \n\nRequire the activity participant to take into account relevant information from the \nDNA of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of \nthe tool developed by the Supervisory Body. \n\n84. \n\nLeakage may occur due to, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\nContinued  use  of  baseline  equipment  being  transferred  beyond  the  activity \nboundary; \n\n13 of 15 \n\n   \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nUse  of  resources  that  have  competing  uses  from  activities  outside  the  activity \nboundary that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary or shifts of \npre-project activities that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary; \n\nDiversion  of  existing  production  processes  or  services  accounted  for  in  the \nbaseline, inter alia through relocation and continuation of baseline activities outside \nthe activity boundary; \n\nImpacts  on  upstream  and  downstream  processes  associated  with  the  materials \nand  services  used  by  the  activity,  and/or  products  or  services  provided  by  the \nactivity, relative to the baseline, unless they are accounted as activity emissions. \n\n85. \n\nLeakage shall be avoided and, where not possible, minimized, or addressed, by, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nDiscounting  credited  volumes:  deducting  emission  reductions  from  credited \nvolumes taking into account equipment lifetime, where applicable; \n\nScrapping  of  baseline  equipment:  undertaking  and  evidencing \ndestruction/decommissioning/disposal of baseline equipment; \n\nthe \n\nApplication  of  higher-level  elements:  applying  a  standardized  baseline  at  a \nhigher  level  of  aggregation  (or  equivalent)  that  is  regularly  updated  and  any \nassociated higher-level monitoring information and/or system; \n\nNesting: Aligning relevant aspects of activity design and implementing activities \ntogether with an existing higher-level crediting programme; \n\nUpscaling  implementation:  implementing  activities  at  a  higher  level  (e.g. \nsectoral, subnational, or national). \n\n86. \n\n87. \n\nFor some types of activities, monitoring and use of a standardized baseline (or equivalent) \nat national scale or jurisdictional level is necessary to quantify and account for leakage. \n\nFor  those  activities  falling  under  the  scope  of  Article  5,  paragraph  2,  of  the  Paris \nAgreement,  mechanism  methodologies  shall  require,  in  addition  to  all  relevant \nrequirements adopted by the Supervisory Body3, demonstration that the activity is included \nin all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, noting \nthis is consistent with the application of the approaches described in paragraph 85 (c) and \n(e). \n\n7.  Non-permanence and reversals \n\n88. \n\nParagraph  34  of  the  RMP  states  that  “Mechanism  methodologies  shall  (…)  address \nreversals, where applicable”. \n\n89.  Mechanism methodologies shall address reversals of removals and emission reductions \nusing  an  approach consistent with  the  standard  on  requirements  for  activities  involving \nremovals under the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n- - - - - \n\n3  See also document Article 6.4 activity standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-002) available at \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf. \n\n14 of 15 \n\n   \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-001 \nStandard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and \nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.1 \n\nVersion \n\nDate \n\nDescription\n\nDocument information \n\n01.1 \n\n26 February 2025 \n\nEditorial  revision  to  correct  formatting  and  a  cross  reference  in \nparagraph 80. \n\n01.0 \n\n9 October 2024 \n\nSBM 014, Annex 5. \n\nInitial adoption. \n\nDecision Class: Regulatory \nDocument Type: Standard \nBusiness Function: Methodology \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, developing and assessing methodologies, methodologies \n\n15 of 15 \n\n   \n \n \n \n\f"}, {"url": "https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf", "title": "Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism", "text": "ARTICLE 6.4 MECHANISM \n\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \n\nStandard \n\nRequirements for activities involving \nremovals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \n\nVersion 01.0 \n\n \n \n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nPage \n\n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION .....................................................................................................  \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n1.1. \n\nBackground ..................................................................................................  \n\n1.2.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement  (CMA),  by  its  decision  3/CMA.3  “Rules,  modalities  and  procedures  for  the \nmechanism  established  by  Article  6,  paragraph  4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement”,  paragraph \n6(c),  requested  the  Supervisory  Body  of  the  mechanism  established  by  Article  6, \nparagraph  4,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (Article  6.4  mechanism)  to  elaborate  and  further \ndevelop, on the basis of the rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism \n(RMP),  recommendations  on  activities \nincluding  appropriate \nmonitoring,  reporting,  accounting  for  removals  and  crediting  periods,  addressing \nreversals,  avoidance  of  leakage,  and  avoidance  of  other  negative  environmental  and \nsocial impacts, in addition to the activities referred to in chapter V of the RMP (Article 6, \nparagraph 4, activity cycle), to be considered at its fourth session (November 2022). 1 \n\ninvolving  removals, \n\nIn  response  to  this  request,  the  Supervisory  Body  agreed  on  the  recommendations  on \nactivities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in the annex to \nthe addendum of its annual report to the CMA at its fourth session2. \n\nThe CMA, by its decision 7/CMA.4, paragraphs 19 and 20, invited Parties and admitted \nobserver organizations to submit, via the submission portal, by 15 March 2023, their views \non activities involving removals and requested the Supervisory Body to consider the views \nof  Parties  and  observers  in  elaborating  and  further  developing  recommendations  on \nactivities  involving  removals,  while  taking  into  account  the  mandate  provided  to  the \nSupervisory Body contained in paragraph 24(a)(ix) of the RMP, and considering broader \ninputs from stakeholders provided in a structured public consultation process. \n\nBased on the request of the CMA in its decisions 3/CMA.3 and 7/CMA.4 and considering \nviews of Parties and observers as well as inputs from stakeholders, the Supervisory Body \nagreed on the updated recommendation to the CMA as contained in the addendum of its \nannual report to the CMA at its fifth session.3 \n\nThe  CMA,  at  its  fifth  session,  requested  the  Supervisory  Body  to  continue  the  relevant \nwork to operationalize the mechanism with a view to elaborating and further developing \nrecommendations for consideration and adoption at CMA 6. \n\n1  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/460950. \n\n2  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6/Add.1 available at  https://unfccc.int/documents/621980.  \n\n3  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/632332.  \n\n3 of 12 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n1.2.  Objectives \n\n6. \n\nThe objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for activities involving removals \nunder the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n2.  Entry into force \n\n7. \n\nThis version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024. \n\n3.  Context of removals under this standard \n\n3.1.  Context \n\n8. \n\nRelevant  extracts  from  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  Sixth \nAssessment  Report  (AR6)  Working  Group  III  (WGIII)  definitions  of  activities  involving \nremovals include the following: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAnthropogenic removals as the withdrawal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the \natmosphere  as  a  result  of  deliberate  human  activities.  (IPCC  AR6  WGIII  report, \nglossary); \n\nCarbon  dioxide  removal  (CO2;  CDR)  as  anthropogenic  activities  removing  CO2 \nfrom  the  atmosphere  and  durably  storing  it  in  geological,  terrestrial,  or  ocean \nreservoirs,  or  in  products.  It  includes  existing  and  potential  anthropogenic \nenhancement  of  biological,  geochemical  or  chemical  CO2  sinks,  but  excludes \nnatural  CO2  uptake  not  directly  caused  by  human  activities.  (IPCC  AR-6  WG  III \nreport, technical summary). \n\n3.2.  Definitions \n\n9. \n\nFor this document, \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nRemovals  are  the  outcomes  of  processes  by  which  greenhouse  gases  are \nremoved from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities and are \neither destroyed or durably stored through anthropogenic activities; \n\nActivities involving removals meet the requirements referred to in paragraph 10. \nAny examples in this standard relating to specific activity types or categories are \nfor  illustrative  purposes  only  and  do  not  have  the  force  of  decisions  by  the \nSupervisory  Body  regarding  their  use  under  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  unless \nexplicitly so stated; \n\nRemovals  eligible  for  crediting  are  as  defined  in  section  4.4  Accounting  for \nremovals;  \n\nReversals are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for removals; \n\nAvoidable  reversals  are  reversals  caused  by  factors  over  which  the  activity \nparticipants have influence or control; \n\nUnavoidable  reversals  are  reversals  caused  by  factors  over  which  the  activity \nparticipants have no influence or control.  \n\n4 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n4.  Requirements \n\n10. \n\nActivities involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the \nArticle 6.4 mechanism shall meet the requirements contained in the following sections, all \nthe  applicable  standards  and  procedures  of  the  Article  6.4  mechanism  and  any  further \nrequirements approved by the Supervisory Body in this regard. \n\n4.1.  Monitoring \n\n11. \n\nActivity participants shall4 ensure that monitoring of removals is carried out based on data \nderived from measurements, sampling, remote sensing, third party sources and published \nliterature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and take appropriate \naccount of the associated uncertainties. \n\n12.  Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that specify the monitoring approaches \nfor  all  parameters  necessary  to  calculate  removals  according  to  the  types  of  removal \nactivities. \n\n13.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  ensure  that  the  net  removals  are  calculated  in  a \n\nconservative manner, taking due account of the associated uncertainties. \n\n14. \n\nTo  allow  for  flexibility  in  monitoring,  default  values  may  be  used  in  the  calculation  of \nremovals provided that the use of the default values results in a conservative estimate of \nnet removals, taking due account of the associated uncertainties. \n\n15.  Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for appropriate quality assurance and \nquality  control  measures,  such  as  cross-checking  of  monitoring  results  with  other  data \nsources  and  published  literature,  or  calibration  of  measuring  equipment  at  regular \nintervals. \n\n16.  Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for monitoring and mitigating any risks \nidentified  in  section  4.6.1  Reversal  risk  assessment,  and  any  risks  identified  in  the \nSustainable  development  tool  of  the  Article  6.4  mechanism,  including  through  the  free, \nprior  and  informed  consent  of  Indigenous  Peoples  directly  or  indirectly  affected  by  the \nactivity. \n\n17.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  include  provisions  requiring  the  activity  participants  to \nsubmit a monitoring plan as part of the project design document submitted with the request \nfor registration. The monitoring plan shall be reviewed and updated at the beginning of \neach renewed crediting period and in any of the following circumstances: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  designated  operational  entity  (DOE)  or  the  Supervisory  Body  identifies  the \nneed  to  revise  the  monitoring  plan  based  on  any  concerns  identified  with  the \nmonitoring plan and the risk assessment plan; \n\nAdditional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are \nnot adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan; \n\n4  For  normative  references,  refer  to  section  Normative  reference  of  the  Standard:  Application  of  the \nrequirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the  development  and  assessment  of  Article  6.4 \nmechanism methodologies. \n\n5 of 12 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(c) \n\nThe  applicable  national  or  regional  regulations  require  the  consideration  of  risk \nfactors  that  are  not  included  or  are  not  adequately  addressed  in  the  monitoring \nplan and the risk assessment plan. \n\n4.2.  Reporting \n\n18. \n\nActivity participants shall prepare  a monitoring report after implementing the monitoring \nactivities specified in the monitoring plan. \n\n19.  Monitoring  reports  shall  be  based  on  the  monitoring  plan  contained  in  the  registered \n\nactivity design document and shall include: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nA description of the monitoring activities and methods used; \n\nThe estimated net removals occurring during the monitoring period, together with \nthe associated uncertainty; \n\nData collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a \nsummary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed; \n\nRecords  and  logs  of  the  observed  events  of  GHG  release  that  potentially  could \nhave led to the reversal of removals along with a summary of  the GHG release \nnotifications  referred  to  in  paragraph  43  that  were  submitted  during  the  period \ncovered by the monitoring report; \n\nInformation on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent \nwith  the  risk  mitigation  measures  described  in  the  registered  project  design \ndocument; \n\nInformation  on  how  any  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  have  been \nassessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the \nregistered project design document. \n\n20.  Monitoring  reports  shall  be  prepared  without  a  gap  between  the  two  consecutive \n\nmonitoring periods, which may be of equal or different duration. \n\n21.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  specify  the  frequency  of  submission  of  the  monitoring \nreports, based on the nature, the type and the risk of reversals associated with the activity \ninvolving  removals  identified  through  the  application  of  necessary  standards  and  tools. \nThe specified frequency shall include the following elements: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  maximum  permissible  interval  between  the  start  date  of  the  first  crediting \nperiod and the submission of the first monitoring report shall be between one and \nfive years; \n\nThe  maximum  permissible  interval  between  the  submission  of  two  consecutive \nmonitoring reports after the first monitoring report shall be between one and five \nyears. \n\nThe activity participants may choose a shorter time period than the time period specified \nin paragraph 21. \n\nIn addition to the monitoring reports referred to in paragraph 21, a monitoring report shall \nalso  be  submitted  following  the  observation  of  an  event  of  GHG  release  that  could \npotentially lead to a reversal, as specified in paragraph 47. \n\n22. \n\n23. \n\n6 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\nThe activity participants may request the Supervisory Body, providing a transparent and \nverifiable justification, to extend the due date for submission of a monitoring report beyond \nthe due date determined in accordance with paragraphs 21 to 23. The Supervisory Body \nshall consider the request for the extension of the due date and shall either grant or refuse \nsuch an extension. \n\nIf the activity participants fail to submit a monitoring report by the due date determined in \naccordance  with  paragraphs  21  to  24,  the  operations  of  issuance,  transfer,  and \ncancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity for which the monitoring report was due \nshall  be  suspended,  and  there  may  be  other  consequences  as  determined  by  the \nSupervisory Body in its guidance on and procedures for addressing late, incomplete, or \nmissing monitoring report submissions. \n\n4.3.  Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting \n\n26.  Monitoring shall continue after the end of the last active crediting period of the activity to \nassess whether any reversals have occurred, quantify the amount of reversals and confirm \nthe continued storage of the GHGs. \n\n27. \n\n28. \n\nNo  A6.4ERs  shall  be  issued  for  the  net  removals  occurring  during  the  post-crediting \nmonitoring period. \n\nThe  activity  participants  may  request  the  Supervisory  Body  to  allow  termination  of  the \npost-crediting monitoring if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable \ninformation, that: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or \n\nThe potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of \nsection 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals. \n\n4.4.  Accounting for removals \n\n29. \n\nAccounting for removals shall be undertaken in a consistent unit of measurement. \n\n30. \n\nRemovals eligible for crediting shall be determined as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe net change in greenhouse gas storage shall be calculated by subtracting the \nsum of the change in greenhouse gas stored in each applicable greenhouse gas \nreservoir in the baseline scenario from the sum of the change in greenhouse gas \nstored  in  each  applicable  greenhouse  gas  reservoir  in  the  activity  scenario, \ncalculated from the start date of the period covered by a monitoring report to the \nend date of the same period; \n\nThe  net change  in  emissions,  not including  any  greenhouse  gas  storage  losses \nfrom the greenhouse gas reservoirs referred to in paragraph (a), shall be calculated \nby subtracting the total emissions in the baseline scenario from the total emissions in the \nactivity  scenario,  calculated  from  the  start  date  of  the  period  covered  by  a \nmonitoring report to the end date of the same period; \n\nIf  the  net  change  in  greenhouse  gas  storage  is  positive,  then  the  number  of \nA6.4ERs  issued  to  the  activity  is  calculated  by  combining  the  following  terms \n(herein referred to as net removals): \n\n(i) \n\nThe net change in greenhouse gas storage, specified in paragraph (a); \n\n7 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(ii)  Minus (-) the net change in emissions, specified in paragraph (b); \n\n(iii)  Minus (-) any applicable leakage effects; \n\n(iv)  Minus (-) any crediting deficit, specified in paragraph (d); \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nIf the calculation in paragraph (c) is negative, then no A6.4ERs shall be issued for \nthe  period  covered  by  that  monitoring  report  and  the  negative  number  shall  be \nrecorded as a crediting deficit and included in future A6.4ER issuance calculations; \n\nIf the net change in greenhouse gas storage is negative, then there is a reversal \nof an equivalent quantity (herein referred to as reversals). \n\n31. \n\n32. \n\nOnly the positive net changes in GHG storage referred to in paragraph 30 that are directly \nanthropogenic shall be eligible for crediting. \n\nA carbon pool, a GHG reservoir or a greenhouse gas may be optionally excluded from \naccounting if it is demonstrated, through transparent and verifiable information, that such \nexclusion results in a more conservative calculation of the net removals. \n\n33. \n\nThe calculation referred to in paragraph 30 shall be carried out for each year of the post-\ncrediting monitoring period. \n\n34.  Where an activity involving removals also results in emission reductions, the accounting \nof  removals  and  emission  reductions  shall  be  separated  in  the  monitoring  report  in \naccordance with the methodology applicable to the activity. \n\n4.5.  Methodologies applicable for a renewed crediting period \n\n35. \n\nAt the renewal of the crediting period, the activity participants shall apply the latest version \nof the applicable methodology. \n\n4.6.  Addressing reversals \n\n36. \n\nThe activity participants shall prevent and minimize the risk of reversals. The reversal of \nremovals  in  respect  of  which  A6.4ERs  have  been  issued  shall  be  fully  remediated  in \naccordance with the provisions of section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals. \n\n4.6.1.  Reversal risk assessment \n\n37. \n\nThe risks of reversals may be related to, inter alia: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nActivity finance and management, asset ownership, rising opportunity costs; \n\nRegulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks, \nacts of terrorism, crime, and war; \n\nNatural  disturbances  and  extreme  events  such  as  fires,  pests,  and  droughts, \nhurricanes,  floods,  and  landslides,  earthquakes,  volcanic  eruptions,  geological \nfaults, and fractures; \n\n(d) \n\nClimate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. \n\n38. \n\nActivity participants shall conduct a risk assessment, which shall include a risk mitigation \nplan, for an activity involving removals, using the reversal risk assessment tool to identify, \nassess and mitigate reversal risks, and calculate an overall percentage-based risk rating \n\n8 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(hereinafter referred to as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable \nreversals, taking into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood, and duration of \nthe risks.  \n\n39. \n\nThe percentage-based risk rating calculated in paragraph 38 above shall inform: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  proportion  of  A6.4ERs  to  be  transferred  to  the  Reversal  Risk  Buffer  Pool \nAccount; \n\nIdentification of A6.4ERs with a negligible risk of reversal which shall be tagged in \nthe mechanism registry. \n\n40. \n\n41. \n\nThe  risk  assessment  and  the  related  information  referred  to  in  paragraphs  37  and  38 \nabove  shall  form  part  of  the  project  design  document  submitted  with  the  request  for \nregistration. \n\nActivity participants shall review and revise the risk assessment every five years from the \nstart  of  the  first  crediting  period  and  in  any  of  the  circumstances  referred  to  in \nparagraph 17. \n\n42. \n\nThe risk assessment and related reporting shall in addition to the above follow any further \nguidance to be developed on risk rating and any upper limits to the risk rating. \n\n4.6.2.  Reversal-related notifications and actions \n\n43. \n\n44. \n\n45. \n\n46. \n\nThe activity participants shall notify the Supervisory Body of any observed event involving \nthe release of stored GHGs that could potentially lead to a reversal (hereinafter referred \nto  as  “the  observed  event”)  within  30  days  of  becoming  aware  of  the  event.  The \nnotification,  which  may  be  in  digital  form,  shall  include  a  brief  description  of  the  event, \nincluding the date or the dates of its occurrence and its location. \n\nUpon the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 43, the Supervisory Body shall \ninstruct  the  mechanism  registry  administrator  to  suspend  the  operations  of  issuance, \ntransfer, and cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity involving removals. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  prepare  a  preliminary  assessment  report,  containing \ninformation referred to in paragraphs 19(a)-(c) in order to determine whether the observed \nevent has resulted in an actual reversal. If the observed event is an ongoing event, the \npreliminary assessment report shall be prepared after the event has ended or has been \nfully contained. \n\nIf the preliminary assessment report referred to in paragraph 45 concludes, on the basis \nof transparent and verifiable evidence, that the observed event did not result in an actual \nreversal, the report shall be verified by the DOE and submitted to the Supervisory Body \nwithin 90 days of the  end of the observed event. If the Supervisory Body  approves the \npreliminary assessment report, it shall notify the activity participants of such approval and \nshall  instruct  the  mechanism  registry  administrator  to  resume  the  suspended  registry \noperations referred to in paragraph 44. \n\n47. \n\nIf  the  Supervisory  Body  does  not  approve  the  preliminary  assessment  report,  or  if  the \npreliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual \nreversal,  the  activity  participants  shall  prepare  a  monitoring  report  in  accordance  with \n\n9 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\nparagraph 19 and, after its verification by the DOE, shall submit the monitoring report to \nthe Supervisory Body within 365 days of the end of the observed event. \n\n48. \n\n49. \n\n50. \n\nUpon receipt of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the Supervisory Body \nshall assess the monitoring report and determine whether the report accurately estimates \nthe magnitude of the reversal and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable, \nand, based on that determination, proceed to take the actions described in section 4.6.3 \nRemediation of reversals. \n\nFollowing the submission of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the activity \nparticipants shall review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk \nrating  of  the  activity  as  necessary.  This  shall  result  in  increased  contribution  to  the \nReversal Risk Buffer Pool Account if there is an increase in the risk rating and require the \ndevelopment of plans to prevent further releases of GHGs. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  also  review  the  compliance  with  the  requirements  and \nsafeguards  contained  in  the  Sustainable  development  tool,  taking  into  account  any \nnegative environmental and social impacts caused by the reversal and developing plans \nto prevent the recurrence of such negative environmental and social impacts. \n\n51. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  remain  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  activity, \nincluding carrying out the processes, actions and measures required by this section. \n\n4.6.3.  Remediation of reversals \n\n52. \n\nReversals of removals for which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated by \ntaking measures described in this section and any other further relevant guidance from \nthe Supervisory Body. The measures  are intended to effectively address reversals and \nmaintain incentives for activity participants to proactively mitigate reversal risks and avoid \nreversals. \n\n4.6.3.1. \n\nReversal Risk Buffer Pool Account operations and contributions \n\n53. \n\n54. \n\n55. \n\n56. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  shall  establish  a  Reversal  Risk  Buffer  Pool  Account  in  the \nmechanism registry which serves to remediate avoidable and unavoidable reversals in full \nthrough cancellation of an equivalent amount and authorization status (authorized A6.4ER \nor Mitigation Contribution Unit) of Buffer A6.4ERs. The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account \nshall aggregate all contributions of Buffer A6.4ERs. \n\nThe Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account shall be administered and shall only be accessed \nby the Article 6.4 mechanism registry administrator. The composition of the Reversal Risk \nBuffer Pool Account, including the share of A6.4ERs by vintage, region and country, type \nof activity, authorization status, risk rating, and methodology, shall be published annually. \n\nUpon  issuance  of  all  A6.4ERs,  an  amount  of  A6.4ERs  proportionate  to  the  issuing \nactivity’s risk rating for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals shall be forwarded to the \nReversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. A6.4ERs forwarded to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool \nAccount shall become Buffer A6.4ERs. Buffer A6.4ERs shall only be cancelled and shall \nnot be further transferred. \n\nFollowing a reversal event and the Supervisory Body’s review of a full monitoring report \nthat  reflects  reversals,  the  Supervisory  Body  will  immediately  notify  the  mechanism \nregistry  administrator  of  the  results  of  its  review  and  the  amount  and  type  of  Buffer \nA6.4ERs required for remediation. \n\n10 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n57. \n\n58. \n\n59. \n\n60. \n\n61. \n\n62. \n\nThe  mechanism  registry  administrator  shall  immediately  notify  the  activity  participants, \neffect  the  cancellation  of  Buffer  A6.4ERs  equal  to  the  amount  of  reversals,  and  shall \nindicate the purpose of cancellation for remediation of reversals in the mechanism registry. \n\nFor avoidable reversals, for which A6.4ERs have been cancelled from the Reversal Risk \nBuffer Pool Account, activity participants shall be fully liable for replenishing the Reversal \nRisk  Buffer  Pool  Account  by  forwarding  the  equivalent  amount  and  type  (authorized \nA6.4ER  or  Mitigation  Contribution  Unit)  of  A6.4ERs  to  the  Reversal  Risk  Buffer  Pool \nAccount within a timeframe to be specified by the Supervisory Body. \n\nActivity  participants  should  obtain  and  maintain  sufficient  coverage  under  an  insurance \npolicy or comparable guarantee products to cover the risk that avoidable reversals occur. \n\nThe Supervisory Body shall oversee a regular stress-test of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool \nAccount to assess the resilience of the pool to a range of reversal risk scenarios and to \nconsider and implement any potential remedial actions necessary to manage risks to the \nrobustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. \n\nThe stress-test shall assess the resilience of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account to a \nrange of reversal risk scenarios based on, inter alia, the range of risk ratings as well as \nsignificant  loss  event(s),  affecting  the  activities  linked  to  the  Reversal  Risk  Buffer  Pool \nAccount.  The  stress-test  shall  occur  at  least  every  three  years  and  in  an  event  of  a \nsignificant loss event. \n\nThe  Supervisory  Body  will  consider  and  implement  any  potential  remedial  actions \nnecessary to manage risks to the robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, \nincluding  ongoing  consideration  of  measures  to  remediate  reversals  and  ensure  the \nresilience, sufficiency, and solvency of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, and other \nappropriate  measures  and  procedures  that  may  provide  suitable  alternative  means  to \nremediate reversals, including the following: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nRequirements  and  approval  procedures  for  the  use  of  insurance  policies,  or \ncomparable  guarantee  products,  or  third-party  guarantee  approved  by  the \nSupervisory Body to cover the risk that reversals occur; \n\nProcedures for establishing, managing, and using a monetary permanence reserve \nenabling  remediation  of  reversals  through  the  direct  or  potentially  centralized \npurchase and cancellation of A6.4ERs with negligible or no reversal risk. \n\n4.6.3.2. \n\nAvoidable versus unavoidable reversals \n\n63.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall,  in  addition  to  the  above,  follow  further  guidance \n\ndeveloped by the Supervisory Body on avoidable and unavoidable reversals. \n\n4.7.  Avoidance of leakage \n\n64. \n\nThe  activity  participants  shall  address  the  risk  of  leakage  and  account  for  any  residual \nleakage  in  calculation  of  net  removals  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  set  out  in \n“Standard:  Application  of  the  requirements  of  Chapter  V.B  (Methodologies)  for  the \ndevelopment  and  assessment  of  Article  6.4  mechanism  methodologies”,  The \nmethodologies and associated tools may include additional requirements for specific types \nof removal activities. \n\n11 of 12 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-002 \nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism \nVersion 01.0 \n\n4.8.

Scope \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nThis  standard  sets  out  the  requirements  for  mechanism  methodologies  with  regard  to \ndemonstrating additionality. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies \nin developing methodologies and by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Methodological Expert \nPanel  (MEP)  and  the  Supervisory  Body  in  assessing  and  considering  mechanism \nmethodologies for  approval.  The  standard  is  not intended  for  the  preparation  of  project \ndesign documents (PDDs) or monitoring reports. \n\nRequirements  relating  to  demonstrating  the  consideration  of  the  benefits  from  the \nArticle 6.4  mechanism  as  necessary  in  the  decision  to  implement  the  activity  are  not \naddressed  in  this  standard.  They  are  addressed  in  the  “Standard:  Article 6.4  activity \nstandard  for  projects”,  the  Standard:  Article 6.4  activity  standard  for  programmes  of \nactivities”,  the  “Procedure:  Article 6.4  activity  cycle  procedure  for  projects”,  and  the \n“Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. \n\n1.2.  Entry into force \n\n3. \n\nThe date of entry into force is the date of the publication of the SBM 015 meeting report \non 14 February 2025. \n\n2.  Definitions \n\n4. \n\nThe following definitions shall apply: \n\n(a) \n\nActivity  participant:  a  public  or  private  entity  that  participates  in  an  Article 6.4 \nproject; \n\n(b) \n\nAdditionality: An Article 6.4 activity is additional if: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIt represents mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or \nregulation (see section 5.1 below). \n\nIt  avoids  locking  in  levels  of  emissions,  technologies  or  carbon  intensive \npractices that are incompatible with paragraph 33 of the rules, modalities and \nprocedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism for the mechanism (see section 6.2 \nbelow); and \n\n(iii) \n\nIt  would  not  have  occurred  in  the  absence  of  the  incentives  from  the \nmechanism,  taking  into  account  all  relevant  national  policies,  including \nlegislation (see section 6.3 below). \n\n(c) \n\nLegal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent \nagreements1, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding \nmandates. \n\n1  For example, agreements between parties, such as between a private sector entity and a government, \n\nto take an action in exchange for avoiding court action. \n\n3 of 17 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n3.  Applicability \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nThis  version  of  the  standard  is  applicable  to  proposed  mechanism  methodologies  for \nactivities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to \nalso cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g. programmes \nof activities, policies, sectoral approaches, etc). \n\nThe standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions \nand net removals. \n\nThe  standard  applies  to  mechanism  methodologies  and  methodological  tools.  For \nsimplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. \n\n4.  General principles and requirements \n\n4.1.  Principles \n\n8. \n\nThe  following  principles  shall  be  applied  in  demonstrating  additionality  to  ensure  that \ninformation provided is a true and fair account. These principles shall be the basis for and \nguide the development of mechanism methodologies: \n\n(a)  Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for the demonstration \nof additionality shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters that \nmay have an impact on the outcome of assessment of additionality shall be included; \n\n(b)  Completeness:  All  relevant  information  to  support  the  assessment  of  additionality \n\nshall be provided; \n\n(c)  Consistency:  The application  of methods  ensures consistent  results  across similar \n\ncircumstances; \n\n(d)  Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative information \n\nshall be reduced as far as is practical; \n\n(e)  Transparency:  Sufficient  and  appropriate  information  shall  be  disclosed  to  allow \nintended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency relates \nto clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied; referencing \nbackground  material;  stating  documentation  changes  and  stating  and  justifying  all \ndata,  parameters,  methods  and  assumptions  made  such  that  the  outcomes  can  be \nreproduced; \n\n(f)  Conservativeness:  In  the  context  of  demonstrating  additionality,  a  methodological \napproach is conservative if the data, parameters, assumptions and methods chosen \nare more likely to lead to conservativeness. \n\n4.2.  General requirements \n\n9. \n\nMechanism methodologies shall specify the approach to demonstrating the additionality \nof an Article 6.4 activity. The approach shall ensure that an Article 6.4 activity would not \nbe implemented without the incentives from the mechanism and that the incentives from \nthe mechanism enable the implementation of the activity. \n\n10.  Mechanism  methodologies  may  either  use  separate  approaches  to  demonstrate \nadditionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both \n\n4 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\ndemonstrates  additionality  and  determine  the  baseline  scenario.  Where  a  combined \napproach is used, both this standard and the standard “Setting the baseline in mechanism \nmethodologies” shall apply. \n\n11.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  ensure  conservativeness  in  the  demonstration  of \nadditionality. This shall apply to all data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used in \nthe analysis (e.g. operating expenditure used in conducting an investment analysis or data \non  the  market  penetration  of  a  technology).  The  degree  of  conservativeness  shall  be \nbased on the level of uncertainty (e.g. in a sensitivity analysis of the investment analysis \nthe  selection  of  the  parameters  to  be  varied  and  the  magnitude  of  variation  shall  be \ninformed  by  uncertainty).  All  sources  of  uncertainty  shall  be  considered,  including \nuncertainty in data, parameters, assumptions, and methods. \n\n12.  Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the provisions to demonstrate additionality \nconsider all national or sub-national policies that are applicable to the relevant Article 6.4 \nactivity and its alternatives. This shall include legal requirements, subsidies, taxes, fees \nand relevant other incentives. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national \ntargets  for  the  sector  or  the  type  of  activity,  as  long  as  these  are  supported  by  policy \nframeworks for implementation, but not general goals that are not specific to the sector or \ntype of activity. \n\n13.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  ensure  that  additionality  is  demonstrated  for  an \nArticle 6.4 activity in its entirety (e.g. the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the \nlandfill gas for energy generation) and that additionality is not separately demonstrated for \ndifferent parts of an Article 6.4 activity (e.g. separately for the landfill gas capture and the \nuse  of  the  landfill  gas  for  energy  generation).  This  provision  does  not  apply  if  different \nactivities can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect each other (e.g. the \nimplementation  of  energy  efficiency \nthe  catalytic  abatement \nof N2O emissions at a nitric acid production plant). \n\nimprovements  and \n\n5.  Approaches to demonstrate additionality \n\n5.1.  Overview of approaches to demonstrate additionality \n\n14. \n\nThis  standard  establishes  requirements  for  the  following  approaches  to  demonstrate \nadditionality: \n\n(a)  Regulatory analysis: Regulatory analysis shall require demonstration that the proposed \nactivity  represents  mitigation  that  exceeds  any  mitigation  that  is  required  by  law  or \nregulation unless the law or regulation refers to or formally integrates the mechanism as \nan instrument for implementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity \nthat  may  require  a  certain  technological,  performance  or  management  action  shall  be \nconsidered, noting that regulatory environments vary; \n\n(b)  Analysis of lock-in risk: Demonstration that the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity \ndoes  not  lead  to  locking  in  levels  of  emissions  or  carbon-intensive  technologies  or \npractices that are incompatible with paragraph 33 of the rules, modalities and procedures \nof the Article 6.4 mechanism; \n\n(c)  Investment analysis: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity is not financially viable in \n\nthe absence of revenues from A6.4ERs;  \n\n5 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n(d) Barrier  analysis:  Demonstration  that  an  Article 6.4  activity  would  be  prevented  by \nbarriers and that the incentives from the mechanism make the determining difference for \novercoming the barriers; \n\n(e)  Common practice  analysis:  Demonstration  that  the relevant technology  or  practice  is \n\nnot common practice (e.g. it has a low market penetration); \n\n(f)  Performance-based approach: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity is unlikely to be \nimplemented without the incentives from the mechanism if it outperforms other activities \nin one or several indicator(s) (e.g. an emissions benchmark) that are a good proxy for the \nlikelihood of additionality for the relevant technology or practice. \n\n5.2.  Possible combinations of approaches \n\n15. \n\nFigure 1 illustrates how mechanism methodologies may combine the approaches referred \nto in section 5.1 Other combinations of approaches are not permitted. \n\n6 of 17 \n\n  \n \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\nFigure 1. Flowchart of the approaches to demonstrate additionality \n\n16. \n\n17. \n\nRegulatory  analysis  and  analysis  of  lock-in  risk  shall  be  addressed  in  all  mechanism \nmethodologies. \n\nThe  investment  analysis  shall  be  used  as  the  default  approach.  Where  mechanism \nmethodologies do not apply the investment analysis, the methodology proponents shall \nappropriately explain and justify why an investment analysis is infeasible or inappropriate. \nIn this case, the methodology proponents shall nevertheless include information on the \nfinancial viability of eligible Article 6.4 activities or require activity participants to provide \nsuch information. \n\n18. \n\nThe barrier analysis may be used as an alternative to the investment analysis, subject to \nthe applicability conditions in section 6.4.1 and appropriate justification. \n\n19.  Where investment analysis or barrier analysis are used, this shall be complemented by a \n\ncommon practice analysis. \n\n20. \n\nPerformance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to the investment analysis, \nbarrier analysis and common practice analysis, subject to the applicability conditions in \nsection 6.6.1 and appropriate justification. \n\n7 of 17 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n5.3.  Application of the approaches at different levels \n\n21. \n\nThe approaches for demonstration of additionality, as referred to in section 5.1, may be \napplied at different levels and by different entities, subject to the provisions in paragraph \n22: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nProponent  of  the  mechanism  methodology:  The  proponent  of  a  mechanism \nmethodology may demonstrate that one or several of the approaches referred to \nin section 5.1 are satisfied for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4 activities \nthat are eligible under the methodology. The methodology may specify applicability \ncriteria or conditions under which the approach is deemed to be satisfied for all, or \na subset of, the potential Article 6.4 activities (e.g. if activities are implemented in \na  particular  region  and/or  if  the  market  penetration  of  the  technology  is below  a \ncertain  threshold  in  the  relevant  geographical  region).  The  proponent  of  the \nmechanism methodology shall provide documented evidence and justifications in \nthe  methodology  that  the  approach  is  satisfied  for  the  relevant  activities.  The \nmechanism  methodology  may  then  state  that  the  approach  is  deemed  to  be \nsatisfied for the relevant activities, as long as the applicability criteria or conditions \nspecified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism methodology may need \nto  be  regularly  revised  to  update  the  underlying  analysis.  The  proponent  of  the \nmechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration of the validity of the \nproposed methodology (e.g. three years); \n\nActivity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify \nin  the  methodology  a  methodological  procedure  for  one  or  several  of  the \napproaches referred to in section 5.1. This procedure shall then be applied by each \nproposed  Article 6.4  activity.  For  example,  a  methodology  may  prescribe  an \ninvestment  comparison  analysis  that  must  be  applied  by  activity  participants  to \nassess the financial attractiveness of a proposed Article 6.4 activity; \n\nHost countries: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify in the \nmethodology  which  approaches,  parameters  or  conditions  may  or  shall  be \ndemonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host \ncountries.. \n\n22. \n\nThe approaches for demonstration of additionality, as referred to in section 5.1, shall be \napplied as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nRegulatory analysis shall be applied by activity participants, or by host countries \n(through the submission of a standardized baseline). \n\nAnalysis  of  lock-in  risk  should  preferably  be  applied  by  the  proponent  of  the \nmechanism  methodology  but  may  also  be  applied  by  activity  participants,  or  by \nhost countries (through the submission of a standardized baseline); \n\nInvestment analysis and common practice analysis may be implemented at any of \nthe three levels referred to in paragraph 21; \n\nBarrier analysis should preferably be applied by the proponent of the mechanism \nmethodology, or by the host countries (through the submission of a standardized \nbaseline). Where it is proposed to be applied by activity participants, appropriate \nexplanation and justification shall be provided why demonstration by the proponent \nof the mechanism methodology, or by the host country (through the submission of \na standardized baseline) is not appropriate. \n\n8 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n23.  Mechanism methodologies may apply different approaches for demonstrating additionality \nat different levels. For example, a mechanism methodology could include a combination \nof  the  following  approaches:  a  regulatory  analysis  and  an  investment  analysis  to  be \napplied by the activity participants, combined with an analysis of lock-in risk and a common \npractice analysis demonstrated by the proponent of the mechanism methodology. \n\n6.  Requirements for specific approaches \n\n6.1.  Regulatory analysis \n\n24.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  include  provisions  to  demonstrate  that  the  emission \nreductions or net removals resulting from an Article 6.4 activity would not occur as a result \nof any law or regulation, unless the law or regulation refers to or formally integrates the \nmechanism  as  an  instrument  for  implementation.  A  law  or  regulation2  applicable  to the \nproposed activity that may require a certain technological, performance or management \naction shall be considered, noting that regulatory environments vary. \n\n25. \n\nThe analysis supporting this demonstration shall confirm that legal requirements, except \nfor  those  that  refer  to  or  formally  integrate  the  mechanism  as  an  instrument  for \nimplementation, do not: \n\na)  Directly require the implementation of an activity; \n\nb)  Indirectly require the implementation of an activity, by requiring a certain technological, \nperformance or management action or by preventing potential alternative scenarios to \nthe implementation of the activity; \n\nc)  Establish a support scheme that: \n\n(i) \n\nIs  designed  to  achieve  a  quantitative  target  or  outcome  for  the  relevant \ntechnologies or practices; \n\n(i) \n\nIs applicable to the activity; and \n\n(ii)  Would  likely  result  in  the  same  amount  of  emission  reductions  or  net \n\nremovals if the activity would not be implemented. \n\n26. \n\nThe analysis shall be based on credible and current evidence and be justified. \n\n27. \n\nThe  mechanism  methodology  shall  specify  the  appropriate  frequency  for  updating  the \nanalysis, taking into account the context of the type of activity, as follows: \n\n(a)  Where the analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in paragraph \n21(b), the analysis shall be conducted at the latest at each renewal of the crediting \nperiod; \n\n(b)  Where the analysis is applied through a standardized baseline,  as referred to in \n21(c),  the  mechanism  methodology  shall  specify  for  how  long  the  standardized \nbaseline may be valid (i.e. by when the standardized baseline would need to be \nupdated to confirm that the conclusion of the analysis is still valid). \n\n2  A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 75. \n\n9 of 17 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n6.2.  Analysis of lock-in risk \n\n28.  Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the analysis of lock-in risk follows a neutral \n\napproach with regards to technology and source. \n\n29.  Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that an Article 6.4 activity: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nDoes not lead to the adoption or the prolongation of the lifetime of technologies or \npractices that are incompatible with long term goals of the Paris Agreement, taking \ninto account different national circumstances, approaches and pathways; \n\nIs consistent with the host country’s long-term low-emission development strategy \n(LT-LEDS), as referred to in Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement (where the host \ncountry has submitted one); \n\nFor technologies or practices with a long lifetime, relies on a technology or practice \nthat  is  among  those  within  the  lowest  greenhouse  gas  intensity  in  the  relevant \nregion  taking  into  account  the  lifetime  of  the  technology  or  practice  in  line  with \nnational circumstances, approaches and pathways; and  \n\nDoes not involve a technology or practice that constitutes an inefficient use of a \nresource that is important for mitigating climate change or achieving other policy \nobjectives. \n\n30. \n\nThe proponent of a mechanism methodology shall either provide appropriate justification \nthat  all  Article 6.4  activities eligible under the  mechanism methodology meet the  above \nrequirements, as per paragraph  29(a), or include a methodological procedure that activity \nparticipants  or  host  countries  shall  apply  to  demonstrate  the  above  requirements,  as \nreferred to in paragraphs 29(b)  and  29(c).  \n\n31. \n\nThe analysis shall consider socio-economic contexts, existing infrastructure and any path \ndependencies. The analysis shall also consider: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe technical or operational lifetime of the technologies or practices established \nas part of an Article 6.4 activity;  \n\nThe emissions intensity of these technologies and practices; \n\nThe scale of the Article 6.4 activity and \n\nAvailability and feasibility of alternative options given national circumstances. \n\n32.  Where the technologies or practices applicable under the mechanism methodologies have \na technical or operational lifetime of no more than 10 years, a mechanism methodology \nmay  assume  that  no  lock-in  risk  exists.  Appropriate  evidence  and  justification  shall  be \nprovided  for  the  estimation  of  the  technical  or  operational  lifetime  of  the  technology  or \npractice. Where this option is used, the validity of the methodology shall be limited to 31 \nDecember 2030 and the methodology shall be reviewed by the Supervisory Body prior to \nits expiry. \n\n10 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n33. \n\nThe analysis shall be implemented in a conservative manner and be appropriately justified. \n\n6.3. \n\nInvestment analysis \n\n6.3.1.  Type of analyses \n\n34. \n\nThe following types of investment analyses may be used: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nSimple  cost  analysis:  Demonstration  that  the  implementation  of  an  Article 6.4 \nactivity  is  associated  with  costs  and  does  not  generate  any  cost  savings  or \nrevenues other than from A6.4ERs; \n\nBenchmark analysis: Comparison of the financial attractiveness of an  Article 6.4 \nactivity with a financial benchmark; or \n\nInvestment comparison analysis: Comparison of the financial attractiveness of an \nArticle 6.4 activity with alternative options. \n\n35. \n\nThe  type  of  analysis  applied  shall  be  suitable  for  the  context  of  the  type  of  Article 6.4 \nactivities that are eligible under the methodology. For example, where the type of activity \ncan  only  be  implemented  by  the  activity  participants  and  the  activity  participants  face \ndifferent  alternative  investment  options,  the  investment  comparison  analysis  is  most \nsuitable. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify the choice of analysis. \n\n36.  Where the analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in paragraph 21(b), \nthe mechanism methodology shall specify which of the analysis referred to in paragraph \n34 shall be used by the activity participants. The mechanism methodology shall set out a \ndetailed procedure on how the analysis shall be conducted. \n\n6.3.2.  General requirements for conducting the investment analysis \n\n37. \n\n38. \n\n39. \n\n40. \n\nThe analysis shall include all relevant costs, including capital expenditure (CAPEX) and \noperational  expenditure  (OPEX),  including  any  barriers  that  can  be  monetized  and \nquantified as an additional cost, and all revenues and cost savings, including any public \nfunding such as subsidies, where applicable. \n\nAll  parameters and  assumptions  used  in  the analysis  shall  be  internally consistent.  For \nexample, cash flows shall be expressed in either real or nominal terms consistently and \nbe  determined  consistent  with  the  financial  indicator  used.  The  assumptions,  data  and \nconclusions in the investment analysis shall be transparently documented, appropriately \njustified and substantiated by evidence. \n\nThe  analysis  shall  be \nin  a  conservative  manner.  To  ensure \nconservativeness, the analysis shall include a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that the \nconclusion of the analysis is robust to reasonable variations in the critical parameters and \nassumptions, including CAPEX, OPEX, revenues and cost savings, as applicable. \n\nimplemented \n\nThe  analysis  of  the  financial  viability  of  Article 6.4  activities  without  revenues  from \nA6.4ERs shall not include any transaction costs associated with generating A6.4ERs (e.g. \ncosts for preparing the PDD, validation and verification, fees to be paid to the UNFCCC). \n\n41.  Where the analysis is applied by the proponent of a mechanism methodology, or by the \nhost  country  (through  the  submission  of  a  standardized  baseline),  as  referred  to  in \nparagraph 21(c) above, the analysis shall demonstrate that it is very likely that Article 6.4 \nactivities  that  are  eligible  under  the  methodology  satisfy  the  investment  analysis.  The \n\n11 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\nanalysis shall be based on data and information that is representative for the Article 6.4 \nactivities  that  are  eligible  under  the  methodology,  reflecting  any  important  variations \namong activities, such as the geographical region, the size of activities, or variations in the \ntechnology or practice. The analysis may be supported by information from the literature \nor  data  from  a  sample  of  activities.  The  analysis  shall  be  publicly  disclosed  with  the \nproposed mechanism methodology. \n\n42.  Where the analysis is applied by the activity participants, as referred to in paragraph 21(b) \n\nabove, the following applies: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe analysis shall be based on data and information applicable to the proposed \nArticle 6.4 activity, except otherwise specified in this standard; \n\nto \n\nThe  analysis  shall  be  based  on  data  and  information  that  is  consistent  with \ninformation  presented \nthe  entity’s  decision-making  management  and \ninvestors/lenders  at  the  start  date  of  the  Article 6.4  activity,  as  defined  in  the \n“Standard:  Article 6.4  activity  standard  for  projects”.  Where  the  project  design \ndocument (PDD) is submitted for validation prior to the start date of the Article 6.4 \nactivity,  the  analysis  shall  be  updated  through  the  submission  of  a  request  for \napproval of post-registration changes in accordance with the procedure “Article 6.4 \nactivity cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002) or as part of at the first \nverification of emission reductions or net removals, based on data and information \nthat was available at the start date; \n\n(c)  Where public funding for an Article 6.4 activity, expressed in grant equivalents, is \nlarger than the expected revenues from A6.4ERs, mechanism methodologies shall \nrequire demonstration that public funding would not have filled the funding gap in \nthe  absence  of  revenues  from  A6.4ERs.  This  may,  for  example,  apply  to  public \nfunding  schemes  that  are  designed  to  pay  for  the  funding  gap  of  mitigation \nactivities; \n\n(d) \n\nFor transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs \nas part of the PDD or monitoring reports. \n\n6.3.3.  Requirements applicable to simple cost analysis \n\n43. \n\nThe  simple  cost  analysis  shall  demonstrate  that  the  implementation  of  an  Article 6.4 \nactivity is associated with costs and does not generate any cost savings or revenues other \nthan from A6.4ERs. \n\n6.3.4.  Requirements  applicable  to  benchmark  analysis  and  investment  comparison \n\nanalysis \n\n44. \n\n45. \n\nA suitable financial indicator for the financial viability of an Article 6.4 activity shall be used, \nsuch as the net present value or internal rate of return. \n\nThe period of assessment shall reflect the period of expected operation of the underlying \ntechnology  or  practice  and  include  the  residual  value  of  the  assets  at  the  end  of  the \nassessment  period. Other  periods  and  approaches may  be  proposed  by  proponents  of \nmechanism methodologies with appropriate justification. \n\n6.3.5.  Requirements applicable to benchmark analysis \n\n46. \n\nThe financial benchmark shall be derived in a conservative manner. \n\n12 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n47.  Where  the  benchmark  analysis  is  applied  by  the  proponent  of  the  mechanism \nmethodology, or a host country (through the submission of a standardized baseline), as \nreferred to in paragraphs 21(c) above, the financial benchmark shall be consistent with \nthe weighted average cost of capital (or the cost of equity, as applicable) that is commonly \napplicable to the country, sector and type of activity. \n\n48.  Where the benchmark analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in 21(b), \n\nthe following applies: \n\n(a)  Where the Article 6.4 activity can only be implemented by the activity participants, \nand  not  by  any  other  entities,  the  financial  benchmark  shall  be  based  on  the \nbenchmark used by the entity implementing the Article 6.4 activity. This may apply, \nfor example, to modifications to an existing plant; \n\n(b)  Where  the  Article 6.4  activity  could  also  be  implemented  by  other  entities,  the \nfinancial  benchmark  shall  be  based  on the  more  conservative  value  between (i) \nthe benchmark used by the entity implementing the Article 6.4 activity and (ii) the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (or  the  cost  of  equity,  as  applicable)  that  is \ncommonly applicable to the country, sector and type of activity. This may apply, for \nexample, to the installation of greenfield plants. \n\n49. \n\nAn Article 6.4 activity shall only be considered additional if the analysis demonstrates that \nthe  Article 6.4  activity  would not  be  financially  viable,  based on  credible data and  input \nparameters to the investment analysis. \n\n6.3.6.  Requirements applicable to investment comparison analysis \n\n50. \n\nIn most sectors, the alternative scenarios considered shall provide the same type and level \nof products or service as the Article 6.4 activity. This requirement does not apply to some \nland-use activities, such as afforestation or avoided deforestation, where there could be a \nchange in the  type  of  service between  the  scenario  with the  Article 6.4  activity  and  the \nbaselines scenario. \n\n51. \n\nAn Article 6.4 activity shall only be considered additional if the analysis demonstrates that \nthe  activity  would  not  be  financially  viable,  based  on  credible  data  parameters  to  the \ninvestment analysis. \n\n6.4.  Barrier analysis \n\n6.4.1.  Applicability \n\n52. \n\nThe barrier analysis may be applied for Article 6.4 activities that are: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nImplemented at individual households (e.g. distribution of efficient cookstoves); or \n\nUndertaken by small public or private entities that typically do not have access to \ncommercial or public third-party finance . \n\n53.  Other cases for the application of the barrier analysis may be proposed by mechanism \nmethodology proponents with due justification and demonstration that such barriers are \nprohibitive, including examples of relevant barriers. \n\n6.4.2.  Requirements for conducting the barrier analysis \n\n54. \n\nThe following barriers may be considered: \n\n13 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nInstitutional  barriers  (e.g.  the  investor  not  being  the  beneficiary  of  cost  savings \nassociated with the investment); \n\nInformation barriers; \n\nFinancial barriers (e.g. lack of access to loans by rural households); \n\nThe  activity  is  first-of-its  kind  (e.g.  no  other  similar  activities  have  been \nimplemented in the relevant geographical area). \n\n55. \n\nInvestment barriers (e.g. high interest rates for loans due to high perceived country risks) \nand other relevant barriers shall be considered as part of an investment analysis. \n\n56. \n\nThe barrier analysis shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nIdentify and describe relevant barriers faced by the Article 6.4 activity; \n\nDemonstrate  that  the  barriers  prevent  the  Article 6.4  activity  from  being \nimplemented without the incentives from the mechanism; \n\nDemonstrate  that  there are  no  other  programs  or  incentives,  such  as  subsidies, \nthat would incentivize the Article 6.4 activity; \n\nDemonstrate that the incentives from the mechanism are the determinant element \nin overcoming the identified barriers; \n\nDemonstrate that at least one plausible alternative to the Article 6.4 activity does \nnot face significant barriers, including the barrier faced by the Article 6.4 activity. \n\n57. \n\nThe barrier analysis shall take into account: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nAll relevant national and sub-national policies, including legislation; \n\nCurrent practices within the sector and geographic area; \n\nIndigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws, where applicable and \n\nRelevant national circumstances, approaches and pathways. \n\n58. \n\n59. \n\nBarriers that are unique to a proposed Article 6.4 activity may only be used if the activity \ncan only be implemented by the activity participants. \n\nThe barrier analysis shall be supported by credible evidence. Such evidence may include \nindependent studies, publicly available surveys, relevant verifiable market data, or data \nfrom  national  or  international  statistics  but  shall  not  include  anecdotal  evidence.  The \nevidence shall be interpreted in a conservative manner (i.e. that it is unlikely that the effect \nof the barrier is overestimated). \n\n6.5.  Common practice analysis \n\n60.  Mechanism methodologies that use a common practice analysis shall include provisions \n\nto demonstrate that Article 6.4 activities are not common practice. This shall include: \n\n(a) \n\nAn appropriate definition of a suitable indicator to assess common practice based \non  the  recent  uptake  or  existing  stock  or  diffusion  of  technologies,  services  or \npractices  in  relation  to  a  realistic  maximum  market  size  or  potential,  taking  into \n\n14 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\naccount  any  constraints  for  the  uptake  of  the  relevant  technology,  service,  or \npractice; \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nA  definition  of  the  appropriate  geographical  boundary  for  assessing  common \npractice for the type of technology, service or practice, taking into account relevant \nmarket boundaries, where applicable; and \n\nThe  specification  of  an  appropriately  conservative  threshold  that  may  not  be \nsurpassed for an Article 6.4 activity to be deemed additional. \n\n6.6.  Performance-based approaches \n\n6.6.1.  Applicability \n\n61. \n\nA performance-based approach may be applied to types of Article 6.4 activities where all \nof the following conditions are met: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nThe  mechanism  methodology  uses  the  baseline  approach(es)  referred  to \nparagraph  36  (i)  or  (ii)  of  the  rules,  modalities  and  procedures  of  the  Article 6.4 \nmechanism; \n\nThe type of activity involves the production of a highly homogeneous product or \nthe provision of a highly standardized service (e.g. electricity); \n\nThe  performance  of  the  type  of  activity  can  be  defined  through  one  or  several \nsuitable indicator(s);  \n\nInformation is available to demonstrate that activities with a better performance in \nrespect to the indicator(s) have a higher likelihood of additionality; \n\nData is available or can be collected on the performance of activities with respect \nto the indicator(s), and the data is robust and representative. \n\n62. \n\nThe  proponent  of  a  mechanism  methodology  shall  demonstrate  and  justify  that  these \nconditions are fulfilled. \n\n6.6.2.  Requirements for conducting performance-based approaches \n\n63.  Mechanism methodologies shall define one or several suitable indicators and thresholds \nfor the performance-based approach and specify the approach to the use or collection of \ndata. \n\n6.6.2.1. \n\nEstablishment of indicator(s) \n\n64. \n\n65. \n\nThe indicator(s) shall be a good proxy for the likelihood for additionality. This means that \nactivities with a better performance in respect to the indicator(s) shall have a demonstrably \nhigher likelihood of additionality. Indicator(s) may be based on different metrics such as \ngreenhouse gas emissions intensity, market penetration or other unique characteristics of \nthe type of activity. \n\nProponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and \nappropriateness  of  the  proposed  indicator(s)  for  the  context  of  the  type  of  activity  and \ngeographical  areas  to  which  the  methodology  is  applicable.  Where  possible,  the \ncorrelation between the indicator(s) and the likelihood of additionality should be quantified. \n\n15 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\n6.6.2.2. \n\nEstablishment of threshold(s) \n\n66. \n\nThe threshold(s) shall be defined such that an Article 6.4 activity is only deemed additional \nif  the  indicator(s)  pass  the  threshold(s)  (passing  may  mean  being  above  or  below  the \nthreshold, depending on the type of indicator). \n\n67. \n\nThe threshold(s) shall be set ambitiously, by: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nEnsuring that an Article 6.4 activity is very likely (i.e. at least 90% probability) to be \nadditional; and \n\nSetting the threshold(s) at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the \nrules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n68. \n\nIt shall be very unlikely (i.e. less than 10% probability) that the threshold(s) are exceeded \nby an Article 6.4 activity due to other influencing factors that are unrelated to the Article 6.4 \nactivity (e.g. interannual variations in climatic conditions). \n\n69.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  specify  the  duration  of  the  validity  of  any  threshold(s) \n\nprovided in the methodology (e.g. three years) and how threshold(s) will be updated. \n\n70. \n\nProponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and \nappropriateness  of  the  proposed  threshold(s)  for  the  context  of  the  type  of  activity  and \ngeographical areas to which the methodology is applicable. \n\n6.6.2.3. \n\nUse and collection of data \n\n71. \n\nThe  mechanism  methodology  shall  specify  the  approach  to  data  collection,  or  which \nexisting data shall be used. The data used by the mechanism methodology shall be: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nRepresentative, reliable, accurate, consistent and transparent; \n\nRecent, especially in dynamic technological environments; \n\nSufficiently disaggregated, taking into account differences in relevant technologies, \ngeographical  or  climate  conditions,  and  the  political,  economic  and  social \nenvironment; and \n\n(d) \n\nVerifiable. \n\n72. \n\n73. \n\nUncertainty  in  the  outcome  shall  be  quantified  and  addressed  through  conservative \napproaches  (e.g.  uncertainty  reductions).  Where  sampling  is  involved,  the  sampling \napproach and any statistical analyses shall be described. \n\nProponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and \nappropriateness of the approach towards using or collecting data in the context of the type \nof activity and geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable. \n\n6.6.2.4. \n\nUse of threshold(s) for determining baseline emissions \n\n74.  Where a threshold is defined as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output, it may also \nbe used for determining baseline emissions, as long as the requirements in the “Standard \nfor baseline setting” are fulfilled. \n\n- - - - - \n\n16 of 17 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-003 \nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.2 \n\nVersion \n\nDate \n\nDescription \n\nDocument information \n\n01.2 \n\n01.1 \n\n5 March 2025 \n\nEditorial correction to paragraph 14 (c). \n\n26 February 2025 \n\nEditorial  revision  to  remove  technology  specific  examples  and \ncorrect cross referencing. \n\n01.0 \n\n14 February 2025 \n\nSBM 015, Annex 11 \nInitial adoption. \n\nDecision Class: Regulatory \nDocument Type: Standard \nBusiness Function: Methodology \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, additionality, methodologies \n\n17 of 17 \n\n  \n \n \n\f"}, {"url": "https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-004.pdf", "title": "Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies", "text": "ARTICLE 6.4 MECHANISM \n\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \n\nStandard \n\nSetting the baseline in mechanism \nmethodologies \n\nVersion 01.0 \n\n \n \n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nPage \n\n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................  \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n1.1. \n\n1.2. \n\nScope .............................................................................................................  \n\nEntry into force ...............................................................................................  \n\nDEFINITIONS .............................................................................................................  \n\nAPPLICABILITY.........................................................................................................  \n\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS ....................................................  \n\n4.1. \n\nPrinciples ........................................................................................................  \n\n4.2.

Scope \n\n1. \n\nThis standard sets out requirements for mechanism methodologies for setting the crediting \nbaseline, including identifying the baseline scenario and determining baseline emissions \nand/or  removals,  and  provides  requirements  for  the  determination  of  standardized \nbaselines.  It  will  be  applied  by  proponents  of  mechanism  methodologies  in  developing \nmethodologies  and  by the  Secretariat,  the Methodological  Expert  Panel (MEP)  and  the \nSupervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism methodologies for approval. \nThe standard is not intended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or \nmonitoring reports. \n\n2. \n\nAdditional  requirements  for  mechanism  methodologies  beyond  setting  the  baseline  are \nincluded in Appendix 1 to this document. \n\n1.2.  Entry into force \n\n3. \n\nThis document enters into force on 16 May 2025. \n\n2.

Provides a similar output as the Article 6.4 activity; \n\nii.  Represents an economically feasible and environmentally sound course of \n\naction; \n\niii.  Is available in the baseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the \nshelf,  or  via  a  tendering  or  direct  contracting  process,  or  by  direct \nimplementation by an end user within the boundary of potential Article 6.4 \nactivities; and \n\niv.  Results  in  the  lowest  emissions  or  largest  removals  per  unit  of  output \namong all practices and/or technologies that fulfil the conditions (i) to (iii). \n\n4 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n(j) \n\n(k) \n\n(l) \n\n(m) \n\n(n) \n\nBest performing comparable activities: The activities that provide outputs within \na  top  segment  of  performance  in  terms  of  greenhouse gas  (GHG)  emissions  or \nremovals per unit of output, considering all activities that provide similar outputs in \na baseline geographical reference area; \n\nBusiness-as-usual (BAU): Plausible reference benchmark or scenario for GHG \nemissions  or  removals  prior  to  or  in  the  absence  of  the  implementation  of  the \nproposed Article 6.4 activity. It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an \nemissions or removals intensity; \n\nCrediting  baseline:  Reference  emissions  or  removals  level  against  which  the \nvolume of emission reductions or net removals achieved by the Article 6.4 activity \nis quantified; \n\nLegal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent \nagreements,  executive  orders,  permitting  conditions  or  any  other  legally  binding \nmandates, noting that regulatory environments may vary; \n\nLevel of aggregation: The extent to which consolidation of information from any \nparts or units to form a collective whole is undertaken; \n\nLevel  of  service:  the  quality,  reliability  and  scale  of  an  output  provided  by  an \nArticle 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario; \n\nOutput:  Each  good  or  service1 provided  by  the  Article  6.4  activity  and/or  in  the \nbaseline scenario, as specified in the mechanism methodology; \n\nPolicies:  All  national  or  sub-national  policies  that  are  applicable  to  the  relevant \nactivity  and  its  alternatives,  including:  policies  and  legal requirements;  subsidies \nand  incentives  (e.g.,  incentives  from  carbon  pricing  schemes  such  as  emission \ntrading  schemes  or  from  guarantees  of  origin);  taxes  and  tax  breaks;  fees; \nperformance  standards;  or  other  specified \ninstruments  or  means  of \nimplementation. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national targets \nfor  the  sector  or  the  type  of  activity,  as  long  as  these  are  supported  by  policy \nframeworks for implementation, but not general goals (e.g., a national emissions \ntarget) that are not specific to the sector or type of activity; \n\nPool of users: For activities related to outputs, the pool of users consists of the \nuser(s) supplied with the outputs by the activity; \n\nRemaining  lifetime:  The  period  during  which  an  equipment  would  continue \noperating and/or a certain practice would remain in place without undergoing major \nrepair or overhaul as specified in the mechanism methodology, given limitations \nsuch as technical lifetime, economic lifetime, legal requirements, policies, or any \nother factor which would lead to the discontinuation of the use of the equipment \nand/or practice; \n\n(o) \n\nSector:  A  segment  of  a  national  economy  that  delivers  defined  output(s)  (e.g. \nmunicipal  waste  management,  household  cooking  energy,  electricity,  residential \ncooling, freight transportation); \n\n1  For example, electricity, cooking energy, municipal waste management, and so forth. \n\n5 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(p) \n\nStandardized baseline: A standardization developed on a subnational, national, \nor  group-of-Parties  basis  rather  than  on  activity-specific  basis  to  facilitate  the \ndetermination of the baseline, calculation of GHG emission reductions or removals \nand/or  the  determination  of  additionality  for  Article  6.4  activities,  while  ensuring \nenvironmental integrity within the scope of the standardized baseline.2 \n\n3.  Applicability \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nThis  version  of  the  standard  is  applicable  to  proposed  mechanism  methodologies  for \nactivities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to \nalso cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes \nof  activities,  policies,  sectoral  approaches,  etc).  The  standard  further  applies  for  the \ndevelopment of standardized baselines. \n\nThe standard applies to mechanism methodologies  related to both emission reductions \nand  net  removals.  The  standard  may  be  amended  in  the  future  to  incorporate  further \nconsiderations for activities involving removals. \n\nThe  standard  applies  to  mechanism  methodologies  and  methodological  tools.  For \nsimplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. \n\n4.  General principles and requirements \n\n4.1.  Principles \n\n8. \n\nThe following principles shall be applied in setting crediting baselines and standardized \nbaselines to ensure that information provided is a true and fair account. These principles \nshall  be  the  basis  for  and  guide  the  development  of  mechanism  methodologies  and \nstandardized baselines: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nAccuracy:  Bias  and  uncertainties  in  both  quantitative  and  non-quantitative \ninformation shall be reduced as far as is practical; \n\nBelow  business  as  usual:  The  determined  crediting  baseline  shall  be  below  a \nconservatively determined BAU emissions level; \n\nCompleteness:  All  relevant  information  to  support  the  baseline  setting  shall  be \nincluded; \n\nConservativeness: In the context of baseline setting, conservativeness is the use \nof data, parameters, assumptions, and methods to ensure that baseline emissions \nare  not  overestimated,  and  baseline  removals  are  not  underestimated.  Only \ncredible sources shall be used that are appropriate to the context of the type of \nactivity; \n\n(e) \n\nConsistency:  The  application  of  methods  ensures  consistent  results  across \nsimilar circumstances; \n\n2  Based on the definition provided in A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 63. Available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf  \n\n6 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\nEncourage ambition over time: Crediting baselines shall decrease over time to \nencourage ambition of activities; \n\nReal: The results of activities represent actual tonnes of GHG emission reductions \nor net removals derived from credible methods for estimating mitigation outcomes; \n\nRelevance:  Data,  parameters,  assumptions,  and  methods  used  for  setting  the \ncrediting baseline shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters \nthat may have an impact on the outcome of setting the crediting baseline shall be \nincluded; \n\nTransparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow \nintended  users  to  make  decisions  with  reasonable  confidence.  Transparency \nrelates to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied; \nreferencing background material; stating documentation changes and stating and \njustifying  all  data,  parameters,  methods  and  assumptions  made  such  that  the \noutcomes can be reproduced. \n\n4.2.  General requirements \n\n4.2.1.  General requirements for quantification \n\n9. \n\nMechanism  methodologies  shall  satisfy  the  general  requirements  for  mechanism \nmethodologies included in Appendix 1 of this standard. \n\n4.2.2.  Description of the pre-activity scenario \n\n10.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  activity  participants  to  describe  the  pre-activity \nscenario  in  the  PDD.  The  pre-activity  scenario  corresponds  to  the  circumstances \nimmediately prior to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and shall be the existing \nconditions  at  the  site  where  the  activity  will  be  implemented;  or  the  conditions  in  the \nabsence of policies that refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for \nimplementation or, for the case of distributed technologies for households, communities, \nand/or  small  and  medium  enterprises,  the  existing  conditions  for  providing  the  activity \noutput(s) in the baseline geographical reference area. \n\n4.2.3.  Data requirements for baseline setting and quantification \n\n11.  Mechanism methodologies shall specify the assumptions, parameters, data sources and \nkey factors used for determining the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline emissions \nand/or removals and specify the related requirements with regard to data quality, vintage, \navailability and credibility. \n\n12.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  data  to  be  sourced  from  the  most  appropriate \ndata source. This may include internal data of the activity participants or publicly available \ninformation  provided  by  third  parties.  Only  credible  sources  shall  be  used  that  are \nappropriate to the context of the type of activity. Relevant  third-party data sources may \ninclude  IPCC  publications,  peer-reviewed  scientific  literature,  test  results  following \naccepted  standards  performed  by  accredited  entities,  reports/statistics  published  by \ngovernments, multilateral entities, or industry or sector organizations, as applicable. \n\n13.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  activity  participants  and  developers  of \nstandardized baselines to transparently list and describe the sources of data considered \n\n7 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nand justify the vintage, relevance, accuracy, and conservativeness of the choices made. \nThe data used shall be referenced. In cases where values, approaches or data sources \nare  only  applicable  to  specific  scopes  (e.g.,  geographic  or  sectoral  scopes),  the \nmechanism methodologies or standardized baselines shall clearly describe the scope of \napplicability of the respective values, approaches or data sources. \n\n14.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  determine  the  baseline  scenario  and  the  baseline \nemissions and/or removals in a transparent manner. They shall also take into account the \nuncertainty  associated  with  setting  the  baseline  scenario  and  quantifying  baseline \nemissions and/or removals, consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. The consideration \nof uncertainty shall include all causes of uncertainty, including assumptions, equations or \nmodels, parameters and measurements. The consideration of uncertainty may, however, \nfocus or be limited to those causes of uncertainty that are most relevant in the context of \nthe Article 6.4 activity (e.g., the uncertainty of minor baseline emission sources may not \nneed to be considered). In the process of quantification of uncertainties, expert judgment \nmay be used, among other approaches provided by relevant IPCC guidelines. \n\n15. \n\nDifferent  approaches  may  be  pursued  to  address  uncertainty.  These  may  include \napproaches  that  address  overall  uncertainty  or  approaches  that  address  uncertainty \nseparately for the baseline scenario and the quantification of baseline emissions and/or \nremovals.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  uncertainties  in  the  selection  of  the  baseline \nscenario,  the  most  conservative  scenario  may  be  selected  among  different  plausible \nscenarios;  whereas,  for  determining  the  baseline  emissions  and/or  removals  the \nuncertainty may be quantified using approaches such as formulas for error propagation. \n\n4.2.4.  Standardization \n\n16. \n\nStandardization  of  baseline  scenarios  and  crediting  baselines \nin  mechanism \nmethodologies  is  encouraged  as  this  avoids  the  risk  of  selection  bias  in  using  project-\nspecific  approaches,  which  could  lead  to  overestimation  of  baseline  emissions  or \nunderestimation  of  baseline  removals.  Such  standardization  may  be  achieved  by  the \napplication of the BAT or ambitious benchmark approach to baseline setting  or through \nthe use of default values. \n\n4.2.5.  Justification of methodological choices and assumptions \n\n17. \n\nThe proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify all methodological choices and \nassumptions  made  in  determining  the  baseline  scenario  and  the  crediting  baseline, \nincluding how the choices and assumptions ensure that the principles and requirements \nin this section and the requirements in Appendix 1 are satisfied. \n\n5.  Approach to setting the crediting baseline \n\n5.1.  Summary of the step-wise approach to determining the crediting baseline \n\n18.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  specify  the  procedure  for  determining  the  crediting \n\nbaseline, in accordance with the step-wise approach in figure 1 and described below. \n\n8 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nFigure 1.  Procedure for determining the crediting baseline3 \n\nStep 1.  \n\nSelect one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36 \nof the RMPs and justify the choice (Section 5) \n\nStep 2.  \n\nApply the selected approach (Section 6), prior to implementation of \na downward adjustment, including: \n\n• Determination of the baseline scenario \n• Quantification of the unadjusted baseline emissions and/or removals \n\nStep 3.  \n\nApply the downward adjustment, unless exemptions apply \n(Section 7), including \n\n• Quantification of the downward adjustment \n• Quantification of the resulting downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or \n\nremovals \n\nStep 4.  \n\nIdentify a conservative BAU baseline (Section 8), including \n\n• Determination of the BAU scenario \n• Quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals \n\nStep 5.  \n\nCompare  the  downward  adjusted  baseline  from  Step  3  and  the \nconservative BAU baseline from Step 4 (Section 9) \n\n•\n\nIs the numerical value of the downward adjusted baseline lower than the \nnumerical value of the conservative BAU baseline? \n\nSelect the downward adjusted baseline \nas the crediting baseline \n\nApply  a  further  adjustment  to  ensure \nthat  the  downward  adjusted  baseline \nis  lower  than  the  conservative  BAU \nbaseline \n\n3  Note that this procedure is applied both ex-ante in the project design document and ex-post in monitoring \nreports. Further details on the timing and the ex-post application is included in sections 8 to 9. For ex-\npost application of the procedure, in Step 5, the lower between the conservative BAU and the downward \nadjusted baseline is selected as the crediting baseline for each calendar year during the crediting period, \nrather than going back to Step 3. \n\n9 of 31 \n\n  \n \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n5.1.1.  Step 1: Selection of one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of the Rules, \n\nModalities and Procedures \n\n19. \n\nIn  Step  1,  mechanism  methodologies  shall  specify  which  of  the  approaches  from \nparagraph 36 of the Rules, Modalities and Procedures (RMPs) is selected for determining \nthe  crediting  baseline  for  the  Article  6.4  activity.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  apply \none of the three approaches specified in paragraph 36 of the RMPs for setting the baseline \nscenario for each of the components of the activity (e.g., for the capture of landfill gas and \nits use for energy generation, one baseline approach may be applied for the capture of \nlandfill gas and a different baseline approach may be applied for energy generation). The \nselected  approach  shall  satisfy  the  applicability  conditions  provided  for  the  relevant \napproach in section 6  below.  The  proponent  of the  mechanism methodology  shall  also \nconsider  the  guidance  provided  in  section  6  on  which  approaches  may  be  best  suited \nunder  different  circumstances  and  justify  the  appropriateness  of  the  choice  among \napproaches (i) to (iii) of paragraph 36 of the RMP. \n\n5.1.2.  Step 2: Application of the selected baseline approach prior to downward adjustment \n\n20. \n\nIn step 2, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the selected approach, prior to any \ndownward  adjustment,  is  applied  to determine  the  baseline  scenario  and the  baselines \nemissions and/or removals occurring in the determined baseline scenario. \n\n21.  Mechanism methodologies shall define and justify, or require the activity participants to \ndefine and justify, the baseline geographical reference area considering the main baseline \nsources  or  sinks.  The  baseline  geographical  reference  area  may  be  global,  regional, \nnational, sub-national or site-specific. An Article 6.4 activity type that supplies a global pool \nof users with a highly internationally traded good (e.g., aluminium) may need to consider \nglobal conditions when setting the crediting baseline. On the contrary, some  Article 6.4 \nactivity  types  may  only  affect  baseline  emissions  within  a  very  restricted  geographical \nscope or even at a specific site4. \n\n22. \n\nTo determine the baseline scenario, the mechanism methodology shall either: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nSpecify and justify the baseline scenario; or \n\nInclude a stepwise procedure for how activity participants or host countries shall \ndetermine the baseline scenario. \n\n23. \n\nThe  procedure  and  methodological  approaches  for  paragraph  22  shall  follow  the \nrequirements set out in section 6 of this standard. \n\n24.  Mechanism  methodologies  may  either  use  separate  approaches  to  demonstrate \nadditionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both \ndemonstrates  additionality  and  determines  the  baseline  scenario,  depending  on  the \napproach selected. Specifically, it may be possible to use BAT or an ambitious benchmark \nto  simultaneously  determine  the  baseline  scenario  and  apply  “performance-based \napproaches”  in  demonstrating  additionality  (refer  to  the  “Standard:  Demonstration  of \nadditionality in mechanism methodologies”).

The  methodological \napproaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 6 of this standard. \n\n26. \n\nUnder all three approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs, mechanism methodologies shall \ndetermine  whether  any  trends  in  the  emissions  and  removals,  or  the  emissions  or \nremovals  intensity  (i.e.,  emissions  or  removals  per  unit  of  output),  over  time  should  be \nincorporated  in  the  baseline  quantification.  Such  trends  may,  inter  alia,  arise  from \ntechnological improvements over time or occur due to policies. This is necessary if such \ntrends have a material impact on the emissions and removals, or the emissions or removal \nintensity,  in  the  baseline  scenario.  Where  such  trends  are  relevant,  mechanism \nmethodologies may reflect such trends by determining a baseline that declines over time \nor by setting the baseline at a sufficiently ambitious level to address any such trends. \n\n5.1.3.

Where  baseline  approaches  from  RMP  paragraph  36  (i)  or  (ii)  have  been  selected, \nexemptions from the downward adjustment may apply in particular circumstances, subject \nto the provisions in section 7.2. Where such exemptions are proposed, the proponent of \nthe mechanism methodology shall provide appropriate justification. \n\n29. \n\n30. \n\nThe procedure and methodological approaches to determine the downward adjustment \nshall follow the requirements set out in section 7. \n\nThe downward adjusted baseline shall be determined as the baseline emissions and/or \nremovals  determined  in  Step  2,  reduced  by  the  quantified  downward  adjustment \ndetermined in accordance with the requirements in section 7.

Application of the baseline approaches at different levels of aggregation \n\n33. \n\nThe baseline scenario or parameters to quantify crediting baseline for emissions and/or \nremovals,  such  as  baseline  emission  factors,  may  be  applied  at  different  levels  and by \ndifferent entities: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nProponent  of  the  mechanism  methodology:  The  proponent  of  a  mechanism \nmethodology  may  determine  the  baseline  scenario  or  parameters  to  quantify \nbaseline emissions and/or removals, for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4 \nactivities  that  are  eligible  under  the  methodology.  For  example,  a  mechanism \nmethodology may determine the baseline scenario as the consumption of power \nfrom the electric grid and may accordingly provide methods to determine the grid \nemission factor to quantify baseline emissions. The proponent of the mechanism \nmethodology  shall  provide  documented  evidence  and  justifications  in  the \nmethodology that the scenario and/or parameters are applicable for the relevant \nactivities.  The  mechanism  methodology  may  then  state  that  these  matters  are \ndeemed  to  be  applicable  for  the  relevant  activities,  as  long  as  the  applicability \ncriteria or conditions specified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism \nmethodology may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis. \nThe proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration \nof  the  validity  of  the  proposed  methodology  (e.g.,  three  years).  Where  the \napplication of the standardization is mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the \nmechanism methodology; \n\nActivity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify \nin  the  methodology  how  the  baseline  scenario  shall  be  determined  and/or  how \nbaseline emissions and/or removals shall be quantified by each individual activity \napplying the methodology. This procedure shall then be applied by each proposed \nArticle 6.4  activity.  For  example,  a  methodology  may  provide  a  method  for  how \neach activity shall quantify existing actual or historical emissions and a downward \nadjustment factor for them; \n\nHost countries: The proponents of a mechanism methodology shall specify in the \nmethodology  which  approaches,  parameters  or  conditions  may  or  shall  be \ndemonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host \ncountries. This may include standardization in relation to baseline setting, baseline \nquantification,  or  additionality  demonstration.  Standardization  could  also  relate \nonly to a specific parameter, such as the grid emission factor or the fraction of non-\nrenewable  biomass.  Where  the  application  of  the  standardized  baseline  is \nmandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the standardized baseline. \n\n6.  Application of baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of \n\nthe Rules, Modalities and Procedures \n\n34. \n\nThis section sets out how the approaches for setting the baseline referred to in paragraph \n36  of  the  RMP  shall  be  implemented  in  mechanism  methodologies.  The  section \ncomplements the requirements set out in Step 2 of section 5. \n\n12 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n6.1.  Best available technology approach \n\n6.1.1.  Applicability \n\n35.  Mechanism  methodologies  may  determine  the  baseline  using  this  approach  where  the \n\nfollowing applies: \n\n(a) \n\nThe emissions or removals per unit of output are determined primarily by the \ntechnology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity; and \n\n(b) \n\nBest available technology (BAT) can be determined with the available data. \n\n36. \n\nThis approach may be particularly suitable where: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAn activity consists of a single technology and/or practice (e.g., \nsubstitution/installation of new equipment such as clean cooking activities); \nand/or \n\nThe activity and alternative technologies and/or practices provide reasonably \nhomogeneous outputs (i.e., they produce similar outputs for the pool of users). \n\n37. \n\nIf the proposed mechanism methodology falls within the scope of the sector or activity type \nidentified by the host party to apply BAT as default approach, then only BAT is applicable. \n\n6.1.2.  Level of aggregation at which best available technology is determined \n\n38.  Mechanism methodologies shall determine, or provide a procedure for activity participants \n\nto determine, the applicability of the BAT baseline, including: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nGeographic scope; \n\nTechnologies and/or practices for which it is applicable; and \n\nValidity over time. \n\n39. \n\nThe BAT approach may be applied at different levels and by different entities in line with \nthe  description  in  Section  5.2  above,  including  by  the  proponent  of  the  mechanism \nmethodology,  the  activity  participant,  or  by  host  Parties.  Next  to  such  bottom-up \napproaches, the Supervisory Body may determine a BAT baseline following a top-down \nprocess. BATs determined by these entities shall have the following geographic scopes: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nSupervisory Body: global, or a narrower scope set during the determination of the \nBAT; \n\nHost Party: the national boundaries of the Party, or a sub-national scope within the \nnational boundaries; \n\nMechanism methodology: the appropriate geographical area as determined in the \nmechanism  methodology,  or  a  narrower  scope  specified  in  the  mechanism \nmethodology for a subset of the potential users; \n\nActivity  participants:  the  location  of  the  corresponding  Article  6.4  activity,  or  as \notherwise specified in the procedure of the mechanism methodology. \n\n13 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n6.1.3.  Determination of the best available technology baseline scenario \n\n40. \n\nThe baseline scenario based on BAT shall be identified as: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAn approved BAT determined by the Supervisory Body or by host Parties; or \n\nA  BAT  specified  by  the  mechanism  methodology  or  determined  by  the  activity \nparticipants following a procedure in the mechanism methodology. \n\n41.  When  considering  whether  a  technology  and/or  practice  is  an  economically  feasible \ncourse of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or \npractice is one that will typically provide sufficient returns to cover investment, operations \n& maintenance costs. \n\n42. \n\nFor  technologies  and/or  practices  applied  in  households,  the  mechanism  methodology \nshall  define  “economically  viable  course  of  action”  based  on  the  type  of  activity  and \ncharacteristics of the users. The definition may be based on the commonly experienced \ncosts associated with the technology and/or practice and shall be based on an investment \nanalysis applying financial parameters that reflect access to finance by households in a \nmanner that does not overestimate financial barriers, and other relevant considerations. \n\n43.  When  considering  whether  a  technology  and/or  practice  is  an  environmentally  sound \ncourse of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or \npractice is in line with laws and regulations on environmental protection in the applicable \ngeographical area and seeks to reasonably minimize environmental harm.5 \n\n44.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  specify  the  appropriate  baseline  geographic  reference \narea  for  determining  the  BAT  or  provide  for  principles  and  requirements  that  activity \nparticipants shall apply to establish this area with proper justification. \n\n45. \n\nThe  definition  of  BAT  specifies  that  the  technology  and/or  practice  “is  available  in  the \nbaseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the shelf, or via a tendering or direct \ncontracting process, or by direct implementation by an end user within the boundary of \npotential  Article  6.4  activities”.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  consider  that  when  the \nArticle 6.4 activity type is greenfield and may displace the implementation of new capacity, \nthen availability relates not just to the specific activity participant, but to any entities that \nmay  implement  similar  technologies  and/or  practices;  whereas,  when  the  Article  6.4 \nactivity type is implemented within existing installations, the availability may be limited to \nthose technologies and/or practices available to the activity participants. \n\n46.  When the BAT is specified in the mechanism methodology or by the activity participants \nfollowing the procedure in the mechanism methodology, then the BAT shall be determined \nby applying at least the following steps: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nDefine the technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity, their \noutput(s), users, sector and, where relevant, market penetration; \n\nIdentify the available technologies and/or practices (and their combinations) in line \nwith the definitions in this standard for supplying the pool of users in the baseline \ngeographical reference area, at the scale required for implementation at a similar \nlevel to the activity; \n\n5  As assessed on a mechanism methodology basis or further defined by the Supervisory Body. \n\n14 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nIdentify which of these available technologies are environmentally sound; \n\nIdentify  which  of  the  environmentally  sound  technologies  are  also  economically \nviable; \n\nDefine the emissions or removals intensity of each of the remaining technologies \nidentified in step (d) above as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-eq) per \nunit of output, based on the average conditions of the technology in the baseline \ngeographical reference area; \n\nIdentify the remaining technology from step (e) above with the best emissions or \nremovals  intensity.  This  technology  constitutes  the  BAT  and  its  emission  or \nremovals intensity forms the basis for the baseline. \n\n6.1.4.  Determination of baseline emissions or removals \n\n47. \n\nThe  mechanism  methodology  shall  define  the  procedures  to  quantify  the  baseline \nemissions  and/or  removals.  When  the  baseline  scenario  is  set  using  BAT,  then  the \nquantification of the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the \nemissions  or  removals  intensity  (as  tCO2-eq  per  unit  of  output)  of  the  identified  BAT. \nHowever,  approaches  other  than  BAT  may  be  used  to  determine  other  parameters \nrequired to quantify the baseline emissions and/or removals. \n\n48. \n\nThe  BAT  may  need  to  be  regularly  revised  to  update  the  underlying  analysis.  The \nproponent  of  the  mechanism  methodology  shall  therefore  specify  the  duration  of  the \nvalidity of the proposed methodology.6 \n\n6.2.  Ambitious benchmark approach \n\n6.2.1.  Applicability \n\n49.  Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where reliable \ndata on best performing comparable activities providing similar outputs  is available and \npermits a conservative and reliable estimation of the baseline. \n\n50. \n\nThis approach may be particularly suitable where: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  sector  is  characterized  by  homogeneous  outputs,  i.e.,  if  there  are  similar \noutputs with a similar level of service for the pool of users; and/or \n\nThe emissions or removals per unit of output depend on multiple factors (inter alia, \ntechnology  and/or  operational  practices,  fuels,  feedstocks,  local  circumstances \nsuch as climatic conditions). \n\n6.2.2.  Determination of the baseline scenario and baseline emissions and/or removals \n\n51. \n\nThe  baseline  scenario  based  on  an  ambitious  benchmark  shall  be  identified  as  the \naverage  emissions  or  removals  level  of  the  best  performing  comparable  activities \nproviding  similar  outputs  in  a defined  scope  in similar  social,  economic,  environmental, \nand  technological  circumstances.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  further  specify  this \n\n6  In case the validity of a BAT expires, users of the mechanism methodology may propose a request for \n\nrevision to update the underlying analysis and validity. \n\n15 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\napproach  and  justify  the  methodological  choices  made,  including  specification  of  the \ncriteria for similarity of circumstances. \n\n52.  Mechanism methodologies shall either directly set the ambitious benchmark, or define a \nprocedure that activity participants shall apply for setting the crediting baseline based on \nan ambitious benchmark, considering the following steps:7 \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nDefine and justify the appropriate baseline geographical reference area for the type \nof technology and/or practice; \n\nIdentify all technologies and/or practices (e.g., types of industrial plants, types of \nhousehold units, as applicable to the activity type) that are providing similar output \nin  the  baseline  geographical  reference  area  in  similar  social,  economic, \nenvironmental, and technological circumstances8; \n\nSpecify which comparable activities (e.g., individual installations or units such as \nindustrial plants, households) in the baseline geographical reference area shall be \nincluded  in  the  analysis,  taking  into  account  the  type  and  characteristics  of  the \nArticle 6.4 activity. For example, if the Article 6.4 activity consists of the installation \nof  greenfield plants,  then only recently  built  installations  shall  be  included  in the \nanalysis.  For  brownfield  Article  6.4  activities \n(e.g.,  energy  efficiency \nimprovements),  existing  installations  may  be  considered,  depending  on  the \ncircumstances.  Similarly,  only  activities  of  a  similar  size  (e.g.,  plants  above  a \ncertain threshold) or within certain locations (e.g., only households in rural areas) \nmay be considered, depending on the context of the Article 6.4 activity. If an Article \n6.4 activity replaces existing installations while at the same expanding the capacity, \ncomparable  activities  shall  include  installations,  or  combinations  of  installations, \nthat can provide the same level of service as the Article 6.4 activity; \n\nSelect  a  suitable  indicator  for  determining  the  performance  of  the  comparable \nactivities  (e.g.  tonnes  of  CO2  equivalent  per  unit  of  output,  energy  efficiency  of \nappliances); \n\nDetermine the appropriate time period for which available performance data for all \nidentified technologies and/or practices shall be included. In some cases, one year \nmay be an appropriate period In cases where the performance varies significantly \nbetween  calendar  years  (e.g.,  due  to  differences  in  climatic  conditions  such  as \nprecipitation), an appropriate multi-year period (e.g., three years) shall be selected. \nThe choice shall be appropriately conservative and be justified; \n\n(f) \n\nCollect  recent  performance  data  for  the  comparable  activities  of  the  identified \ntechnologies and/or practices in the baseline geographical reference area; \n\n7  Mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches towards determining an ambitious \n\nbenchmark. \n\n8  For example, for cement for building construction applications, the technologies are those being \n\napplied for building construction with similar structural capabilities, e.g., other cement production for \nconcrete-based construction, wood-frame construction, steel-frame construction, masonry. For another \nexample, metal- alloy production, the technologies are those being applied for the same metal-alloy \nproduction. \n\n16 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\n(i) \n\nPrepare  a  performance  distribution  curve,  using  the  selected  indicator  such  as \ntonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, for the total amount of output provided \nby the comparable activities in the baseline geographical reference area; \n\nSpecify how to define the group of best performing comparable activities bounded \nat  maximum  by  the  20th  percentile  of  the  distribution  curve  or  lower  (e.g.,  10th \npercentile, 5th percentile), and justify the choice; \n\nCalculate the weighted average (by output) performance of all the best performing \ncomparable  activities  including  and  beyond  the  selected  percentile,  using  the \nselected indicator such as tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output. \n\n53. \n\nThe value determined in sub-bullet (h) constitutes the ambitious benchmark and shall form \nthe basis for quantifying the baseline emissions and/or removals. \n\n54.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  define  the  methods  for  quantification  of  the  ambitious \nbenchmark baseline. When the baseline scenario is set using an ambitious benchmark, \nthen the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the benchmark. \nHowever, other parameters needed to quantify baseline emissions and/or removals may \nbe derived using other approaches (for example, an ambitious benchmark for the energy \nefficiency of comparable activities may be combined with a default value for the specific \nGHG intensity per unit of energy). \n\n55.  When  the  ambitious  benchmark  is  determined  by  activity  participants,  by  applying  a \nprocedure  defined  in  a  mechanism  methodology,  the  mechanism  methodology  shall \nspecify which type of data sources may be used by activity participants. The mechanism \nmethodology  should  aim  to  ensure  that  the  data  is  both  of  high  quality  and  recent, \npreferably with a vintage of no more than 3 years prior to the year in which the PDD is \nsubmitted for global stakeholder consultation. \n\n6.3.  Existing actual or historical emissions approach \n\n6.3.1.  Applicability \n\n56.  Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where there \nis limited data availability on the emissions or removals performance from similar activities \nin the sector. \n\n57. \n\nThis approach may be particularly suitable where: \n\n(a) \n\nEmissions or removals per unit of output are dependent on factors that are highly \nactivity- or site-specific; and/or \n\n(b) \n\nSector data shows strongly heterogeneous circumstances. \n\n58.  Where an Article 6.4 activity replaces specific equipment that was used in the pre-project \nscenario  and  could  continue  to  be  used,  a  baseline  scenario  determined  using  this \napproach shall only remain valid until, at maximum, the end of the reasonably expected \nremaining lifetime of the equipment that was used in the pre-activity scenario. \n\n6.3.2.  Baseline scenario selection \n\n59. \n\nThe baseline scenario may be identified based on existing actual or historical emissions. \n\n17 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n60. \n\nThe mechanism methodology shall specify a pre-determined baseline scenario or contain \na procedure to determine the baseline scenario. Possible baseline scenarios may include: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe  continuation  of  the  pre-activity  scenario  up  to  a  certain  point  in  time  (for \nexample, up to the time at which a retrofit would have occurred); \n\nA dynamic baseline scenario over time (for example, if a gradual shift away from \nthe pre-activity scenario is observed); \n\nThe  retrofit  or  replacement  of  equipment  that  has  been  used  in  the  pre-activity \nscenario; \n\n(d) \n\nThe implementation of the Article 6.4 activity at a later point in time. \n\n6.3.3.  Methods for quantification of baseline emissions and/or removals \n\n61. \n\nThe mechanism methodology shall define the methods to quantify the baseline emissions \nand/or removals as tCO2-eq or the baseline emissions or removals intensity as tCO2-eq \nper  unit  of  output.  The  determination  shall  be  consistent  with  the  identified  baseline \nscenario. The baseline may be derived using the following general methods: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nSite-specific  historical  data:  Where  this  method  is  used,  the  mechanism \nmethodology  shall  address  issues  related  to  the  minimum  number  of  historical \nyears to consider, year-on-year variability, any trends in the historical data and the \nneed for the use of factors to account for improvements in performance that may \noccur in the baseline scenario over time; \n\nControl  group:  Where  this  method  is  used,  the  mechanism  methodology  shall \nestablish  requirements  related  to  selection  of  the  control  group;  shared \ncharacteristics  between  the  activity  and  control  groups  such  as  location,  pre-\ntechnologies  and/or  practices,  and  socio-economic \nactivity  and  project \ncircumstances; and statistical tests for similarity between the control and activity \ngroup; \n\nModel: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall address the \nselection, calibration, capabilities, credibility and conservativeness of models; and \n\nDefault factors:  Where this method  is  used, the  mechanism methodology  shall \nspecify  the  source  of  the  default  factors  used  and  ensure  their  relevance  and \nconservativeness. \n\n7.  Determination of the downward adjustment \n\n62.  Mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition through setting crediting baselines \nbelow  BAU  and  increasing  the  ambition  of  crediting  baselines  over  time.  Therefore, \nmechanism  methodologies  shall  include  factors  or  quantitative  methods  for  downward \nadjustment appropriate to the sector, Article 6.4 activity type and scale of the activity. The \nfactors  or  quantitative methods shall  be  based  on clear  and objective  criteria  and shall \nresult  in  a  downward  adjustment  that  ensures  the selected  baseline  is  below  BAU  and \nencourages ambition over time. \n\n18 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n7.1.

Downward adjustment in subsequent years \n\n65. \n\n66. \n\n67. \n\n68. \n\nFor  all  three  baseline  approaches  in  paragraph  36  of  the  RMPs  (i.e.,  BAT,  ambitious \nbenchmark,  and  existing  actual  or  historical  emissions),  a  downward  adjustment  shall \napply in all calendar years following the start date of the first crediting period, unless an \nexemption in specific circumstances is approved by the Supervisory Body. \n\nSuch exemptions shall only apply to baselines based on BAT or ambitious benchmarks. \nEconomic  viability  could  be  a  consideration  for  exemptions,  for  example,  where  the \napplication of a downward adjustment may result in no calculated emission reductions or \nnet removals. \n\nThe  downward  adjustment  applied  in  subsequent  years  shall  increase  over  time  to \nencourage ambition over time and ensure that the baseline is below BAU. \n\nFor  baselines  determined  based  on  existing  actual  or  historical  emissions,  the  starting \npoint for increasing the downward adjustment over time shall be the downward adjustment \nin the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period, as determined in section \n7.1  above.  For  baselines  determined  based  on  BAT  or  an  ambitious  benchmark,  the \ndownward adjustment shall increase from a value of zero applied in the calendar year of \nthe start date of the first crediting period. \n\n20 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n69. \n\nThe increase in the downward adjustments over time shall be operationalised either as an \nannual change or as stepwise change implemented not less frequently than every three \nyears. An increase in the downward adjustment shall be applied starting on 1 January of \na  calendar  year.  The  first  increase  shall  be  applied  in  the  calendar  year  following  the \ncalendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. \n\n70.  Mechanism methodology shall specify the factors or quantitative methods to calculate the \ndownward adjustment for subsequent calendar years of the crediting period and how the \nincrease over time is operationalised. The determination of the downward adjustment may \nbe based on the following principles and considerations: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nConsideration  of  economic  viability  of  the  mitigation  technologies  and/or \npractices:  The  quantitative  methods  and  factors  could  consider  the  economic \nviability  of  the  relevant  mitigation  activities.  This  holds  in  particular  for  critical \nmitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization technologies, \nand  negative  emission  approaches.  The  quantitative  methods  and  factors  could \nresult  in  relatively  lower  downward  adjustments  for  these  technologies  and \napproaches,  and  other  critical  technologies  at  an  early  stage  of  innovation  and \ndiffusion,  compared  with  technologies  and/or  practices  that  are  closer  to  being \neconomically viable; \n\nSetting  incentives  for  the  adoption  of  less  GHG  intensive  technologies \nand/or practices: The factors and quantitative methods could result in a relatively \nhigher  downward  adjustment  for  more  GHG  intensive  technologies  and/or \npractices  and  a  relatively  lower  downward  adjustment  for  less  GHG  intensive \ntechnologies and/or practices10; \n\nConsideration  of  established  long-term  pathways:  Already  established  long-\nterm  pathways  for  emissions,  technologies  and/or  practices  adopted  by  Parties, \ngroups  of  Parties  and/or  international  industry  associations  could  inform  the \ndownward  adjustment.  This  could  mean  that  some  sectors,  regions  or  Parties \nwould have greater annual increases to the downward adjustment compared with \nothers; \n\nConsideration  of  concept  of  sufficiency:  Considering  work  on  sufficiency \npresented  in  IPCC  AR6 WGIII,  Chapter  9,  the  factors  and  quantitative  methods \ncould result in a relatively higher downward adjustment for activities implemented \nin a context of high resource consumption patterns and a relatively lower downward \nadjustment for lower resource consumption patterns11; \n\nConsideration  of  suppressed  demand:  The  quantitative  methods  and  factors \ncould result in a relatively lower downward adjustment for sectors or regions where \ndemand is suppressed. \n\n10  For example, the downward adjustment may be higher for Article 6.4 activities flaring landfill gas than for \n\nactivities using the landfill gas as fuel; \n\n11  For example, in the buildings sector, it may be proposed that for communities whose energy consumption \nwas historically high, the rate of reducing emissions is higher than that for communities with historically \nlow energy consumption \n\n21 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n71. \n\nThe annual increase in the downward adjustment shall correspond to at least 1% of the \nbaseline emissions in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. A pro-\nrata  approach  may  be  used  to  apply  this  minimum  value  to  periods  other  than  a  full \ncalendar year. \n\n8.  Determination  of  a  conservative  business-as-usual \n\nbaseline \n\n72.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  include  provisions  to  demonstrate  that  the  downward \nadjusted  baseline  is  below  BAU.  For  that  purpose,  mechanism  methodologies  shall \nrequire the identification of a conservative BAU scenario that would occur in the absence \nof the Article 6.4 activity and provide a method for the quantification of the corresponding \nBAU emissions and/or removals in a conservative manner. The BAU also may be defined \nusing an approved standardized baseline. \n\n73. \n\nThe proponent of a mechanism methodology shall consider the following alternatives for \nthe  purpose  of  determining  the  BAU  scenario  and  justify  the  choice,  including  how  it \nensures conservativeness: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nContinuation of the historical situation (pre-activity scenario); \n\nEstablishment of an economically viable technology and/or practice; \n\nA scenario combining (a) for the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or \npractice, followed afterwards by (b); or \n\nOnly  when  it  is  justified  that  the  previous  alternatives  are  not  suitable,  another \nrelevant scenario in line with the applicable principles and requirements set out in \nthis standard. \n\n74.  Where several scenarios are plausible, the most conservative scenario shall be chosen \n\nas the BAU scenario. \n\n75. \n\nThe proponent of a mechanism methodology may consider the following approaches for \nestimating the BAU emissions and/or removals and shall justify the choice: \n\n(a)  Where  the  activity  is  not  a  greenfield  activity,  mechanism  methodologies  may \nconsider the historical emissions or emissions intensity prior to the implementation \nof  the  activity,  including  any  trends  toward  improving  performance,  for  the \nremaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice; or \n\n(b)  Where the activity is a greenfield activity, or where it operates beyond the end of \nthe  remaining  lifetime  of  the  existing  equipment  and/or  practice,  mechanism \nmethodologies  may  consider  the  average  emissions  intensity  of  new  capacity \ninstalled  in  the  past  three  years,  in  the  baseline  geographical  reference  area, \nand/or in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances \nand providing similar outputs as the activity with these criteria specified further in \nthe mechanism methodology. \n\n22 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n76. \n\nIn  determining  the  BAU  scenario  and  quantifying  the  BAU  emissions  and/or  removals \npursuant  to  paragraphs  72  to  75  above,  mechanism  methodologies  shall  identify  and \nincorporate in the BAU: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nAny policies that are active or scheduled to take effect within the crediting period, \nunless  they  refer  to  or  formally  integrate  the  mechanism  as  an  instrument  for \nimplementation.  All  legal  requirements  shall  be  deemed  to  be  enforced  while \nrecognizing that regulatory environments vary; and \n\nAny specific national or sub-national targets for the sector or the type of activity, as \nlong  as  these  are  supported  by  policy  frameworks  for  implementation12,  but  not \ngeneral goals that are not specific to the sector or type of activity. \n\n77.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  ensure that  the comparison  of the  downward  adjusted \nbaseline with the BAU baseline in section 5 (Step 5 in Figure 1) results in the determination \nof  a  crediting  baseline  that  is  below  BAU.  For this  purpose, mechanism  methodologies \nshall identify the conservative BAU baseline as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nThrough the following step-wise procedure: \n\ni.  Determine  the  uncertainty  at  the  lower  bound  of  the  uncertainty  interval \nrelative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified BAU net baseline \nemissions and/or removals during the first crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦). \nThe  determination  of  the  uncertainty  shall  consider  all  causes  of \nuncertainty as per paragraph 13 in Appendix 1; \n\nii.  Determine  the  conservative  BAU  baseline  emissions  and/or  removals \nbased  on  uncertainty  for  the  relevant  year  or  period  (BAUcons,UNC,y),  as \nfollows13; \n\n𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦) \n\nEquation (4) \n\nWhere: \n\n𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦  = \n\nUncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval \nrelative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified most \nlikely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals during the \nfirst crediting period year y (fraction) \n\n𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦  = \n\nConservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based \non uncertainty in year y \n\n𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝑦 \n\ny \n\n= \n\nMost likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals in \nyear y \n\n=  Relevant year or period (see instructions below) \n\n12  The extent to which the policy frameworks in place are sufficient to enable the achievement of the targets \nmay be considered in determining their relevance for the BAU scenario and quantification, as well as \nwhether they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for implementation. \n\n13  Where, for the uncertainty of a central value, the absolute upper bound of the uncertainty interval is a \npositive number and the absolute lower bound of the uncertainty interval a negative number, or vice-\nversa, further guidance will be developed. \n\n23 of 31 \n\n  \n \n \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\niii.

Comparison and selection of crediting baseline \n\n81.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  provisions  to  require  activity  participants  to \n\nundertake the following comparisons. \n\n82.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  activity  participants  to  compare,  ex-ante  in the \n\nproject design document, the following two baselines: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3; and \n\nThe conservative BAU baseline resulting from Step 4. \n\n83.  Where the ex-ante conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals is lower than \nthe ex-ante downward adjusted baseline for any calendar year or cumulatively over the \ncrediting period, then the mechanism methodology shall require the activity participant to \nreturn  to  Step  3  and  revise  the  quantitative  methods  and  factors  to  determine  the \ndownward adjustment, to ensure that the downward adjusted baseline is lower than the \nconservative  BAU  baseline  for  each  calendar  year  and  cumulatively  for  the  crediting \nperiod. \n\n84.  Mechanism methodologies shall further require activity participants to compare, ex-post \nin monitoring reports, for each individual calendar year during the crediting period, the ex-\npost  calculated  downward  adjusted  baseline  for  the  year  and  the  ex-post  calculated \nconservative  BAU  baseline  for  the  same  year  and  confirm  that  the  downward  adjusted \nbaseline is lower than the conservative BAU baseline. If it is not, then the conservative \nBAU baseline shall be used for that calendar year. \n\n25 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nAppendix 1.  General  requirements  for  mechanism \n\nmethodologies \n\n1. \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nApplicability conditions \n\nMechanism methodologies shall specify the conditions under which proposed Article 6.4 \nactivities  may  use  the  methodology.  Applicability  conditions  shall  clearly  describe  the \ntechnologies  and/or  practices  which  are  eligible  under  a  methodology  as  well  as,  if \nappropriate, those which are not. \n\nApplicability  conditions  shall  also  prevent  the  use  of  the  methodologies  in  contexts, \nconfigurations  and  cases  for  which  these  are  not  intended  and  under  which  an \noverestimation of emission reductions or net removals and/or perverse incentives could \noccur. \n\nFor  each  applicability  condition,  the  mechanism  methodology  shall  specify  whether  the \nfulfilment of the condition shall be assessed: \n\n(a) \n\nOnce  at  the  initial  validation  of  the  PDD  or,  where  the  information  is  not  yet \navailable, at the first verification of emission reductions or net removals; or \n\n(b) \n\nAt each verification of emission reductions or net removals. \n\nDefinition of the activity boundary \n\nThe proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all emission sources, sinks or \nreservoirs  that  could  be  altered  by  Article  6.4  activities  that  are  eligible  under  the \nmethodology.  For  each  identified  source,  sink  or  reservoir, the  proponent  shall  indicate \nwhether it pertains to the baseline scenario and/or the Article 6.4 activity scenario. The \nproponent shall compare the sources, sinks and reservoirs between the two scenarios in \na tabular format to ensure a complete and fair comparison. \n\nThe proponent shall further indicate whether each identified source, sink and reservoir is \ncontrolled, related to, or otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4 activities, in line \nwith the definitions, and provide adequate justification. Note that some sources, sinks or \nreservoirs may be classified in different ways, depending on the configuration of the Article \n6.4 activity1; where applicable, this should be indicated. \n\nBased on this analysis, mechanism methodologies shall define the  activity boundary of \nthe applicable Article 6.4 activities, including which emission sources, sinks or reservoirs \nand GHGs are included. The activity boundary shall be presented in table, covering both \nthe Article 6.4 activity scenario and the baseline scenario. \n\n1  For example, in some activities, a source of transport emissions may be controlled whereas in others it \n\nmay be related. \n\n26 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\nThe  activity  boundary  shall  include  all  emission  sources,  sinks  or  reservoirs  that  are \nidentified as controlled or related. The activity boundary also may include sources, sinks \nor  reservoirs  that  are  identified  as  otherwise  affected  by  the  applicable  Article  6.4 \nactivities.2 Changes  in  anthropogenic  emissions  and/or  removals  of  GHGs  that  occur \noutside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity shall be considered \nas  leakage,  subject  to  the  provisions  in  the  draft  standard  “Addressing  leakage  in \nmechanism methodologies”. \n\nMechanism methodologies may omit sources, sinks or GHGs from the activity boundary, \nprovided  that  the  omission  leads  to  a  more  conservative  quantification  of  emission \nreductions or net removals. For example, where it can be demonstrated for the range of \nactivities that may  apply  the methodology that  upstream  emissions  associated  with  the \nArticle  6.4  scenario  are  lower  than  upstream  emissions  associated  with  the  baseline \nscenario, the relevant upstream emissions may be omitted in both the Article 6.4 activity \nscenario  and  the  baseline  scenario.  The  mechanism  methodology  may  also  specify \nconditions under which certain sources, sinks, reservoirs or GHGs shall be considered or \nmay  be  omitted.  The  proponent  of  the  mechanism methodology shall  demonstrate  and \nprovide  appropriate  justifications  for  any  such  omissions,  including  that  the  omission  is \nconservative for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology. \n\nMechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to delineate the geographical \nboundary of a proposed Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies may require activity \nparticipants to specify the location of the activity in the form of Keyhole Markup Language \nfiles or  similar  formats  as  one or more  polygon(s),  by  specifying  the  coordinates of the \ngeographic boundary using a known coordinate system or any other method to delineate \nthe geographic boundary. The geographic boundary may cover more than one host Party. \nWhere appropriate, the mechanism methodology may request the location of the leakage \nemission sources and sinks to be described as well. \n\n10.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  require  demonstration  that  the  activity,  does  not \nconstrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party \nwith regard to the nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, its long-term \nlow greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS), if it has submitted one, \nand  the long-term temperature goal  of the  Paris  Agreement  and  long-term  goals  of  the \nParis Agreement through an assessment, undertaken by the DNA of the host Party, of the \nactivity’s consistency with Decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 40 (c) and paragraph 27 (a) as \npart of the host Party’s approval. \n\n3. \n\nCalculation of emission reductions or net removals \n\n11.  Mechanisms methodologies shall include provisions to determine emission reductions or \nnet removals separately for each calendar year. To address situations where monitoring \nperiods  cover  more  than  one  calendar  year,  mechanism  methodologies  shall  specify \nmethods to allocate the emission reductions or net removals achieved during a monitoring \nperiod  to  calendar  years.  The  method  of  allocation  shall  be  based  on  the  best \n\n2  For  example,  for  activities  that  provide  renewable  electricity  to  the  grid  and  thereby  affect  electricity \ngeneration by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a \nbaseline emission source within the activity boundary. \n\n27 of 31 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\napproximation for when the emission reductions or net removals have likely occurred. The \nfollowing approaches shall be used: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nProportional  allocation:  Where  this  is  plausible,  emissions  or  removals  in  the \nmonitoring period shall be allocated proportionally to the duration of the period in \neach  calendar  year.  If  annual  caps  or  other  annual  values  are  applied  in  the \nmethodology, these shall be pro-rated to periods shorter than a full calendar year; \n\nAllocation  based  on  likely  expected  or  observed  trends  or  patterns:  Where \nproportional  allocation  is  not  plausible,  emissions  or  removals  in  the  monitored \nperiod shall be allocated based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns. \nFor example, for an afforestation activity, growth tables for the respective species \nand local conditions may be used to allocate a stock change observed over a multi-\nyear period to individual calendar years; \n\n12.  Mechanism methodologies shall specify whether the type of Article 6.4 activities covered \nby the methodology may generate emission reductions, net removals, or both emission \nreductions  and  net  removals.  Where  Article  6.4  activities  may  generate  both  emission \nreductions  and  net  removals,  mechanism  methodologies  shall  include  provisions  to \nseparately determine the emission reductions and the net removals that have occurred in \na monitoring period. \n\n4. \n\nConservativeness and uncertainty \n\n13.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  apply  a  conservative  approach  to  ensure  that  the \nemission reductions or net removals from an Article 6.4 activity using the methodology are \nvery unlikely to be overestimated, taking into account the overall uncertainty in quantifying \nthe emission reductions or net removals. The implementation of conservativeness (e.g., \nthrough conservative assumptions, parameters, discounts) in determining the calculated \nemission  reductions  or  net  removals  shall  be  based  on  the  level  of  uncertainty  (e.g., \napplying a larger deduction in case of higher uncertainties). All causes of uncertainty shall \nbe  considered,  including  uncertainty  in  data  (e.g.,  measurements),  parameters  (e.g., \nrepresentativeness  of  default  values),  assumptions  (e.g.,  the  baseline  scenario),  and \nmethods (e.g., models to quantify emission reductions). \n\n5. \n\nAttributability  of  emission  reductions  or  net  removals  to  the  Article  6.4 \nactivity \n\n14.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  ensure  that  the  quantified  emission  reductions  or  net \nremovals result from the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and not from changes in \nexogenous  factors  that  are  not  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  Article  6.4  activity. \nMechanism methodologies shall therefore require approaches that take into account and \nadjust for exogenous factors affecting emission reductions or net removals. \n\n6. \n\nPotential perverse incentives \n\n15. \n\nThe  proponent  of  a  mechanism  methodology  shall  identify  any  potential  perverse \nincentives for the activity participants to inflate the calculated emissions reductions or net \nremovals. This may include cases where output levels could increase as a result of the \nincentive of the mechanism. Where such perverse incentives can occur, the mechanism \nmethodology shall ensure that they are avoided. \n\n28 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n7. \n\nRebound effects \n\n16.  Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that rebound effects (i.e., an increase in the level \nof service as a result of the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity, e.g., when introducing \nenergy-efficient appliances) are accounted for. Where applying the provisions with regard \nto suppressed demand, further requirements or guidance from relevant other standard(s) \nmay be considered. \n\n8. \n\nAvoidance of double counting \n\n17. \n\nThe  proponent  of  a  mechanism  methodology  shall  identify  risks  of  potential  double \ncounting of the emission reductions or net removals and, where such risks are relevant \nand  material,  include  provisions  to  avoid  such  double  counting  in  the  mechanism \nmethodology. This shall include but not be limited to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nDouble counting due to overlapping claims between different crediting mechanism \nactivities; \n\nDouble counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes; and \n\nDouble counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets. \n\n8.1.  Double  counting  due  to  overlapping  claims  between  different  carbon  crediting \n\nmechanism activities \n\n18. \n\nDouble  counting  may  occur  if  different  carbon  crediting  mechanism  activities  claim  the \nsame emission reductions or removals. The consideration of this form of double counting \nshall include but not be limited to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nThe  risk  of  different  entities  claiming  the  emission  reductions  or  removals \nassociated  with  the  production  and  use  of  goods  or  services  (e.g.,  both  the \nproducer and the consumer of a biofuel claiming the same emission reductions); \n\nThe risk of overlap from emission sources or carbon pools that occur upstream and \ndownstream  of  the  activity  (e.g.,  an  efficient  cookstove  activity  and  an  avoided \ndeforestation activity claiming the same emission reductions); \n\nThe  risk  of  overlap  due  to  implementation  of  activities  at  different  aggregation \nlevels  within  the  same  geographical  area  (e.g.,  a  project-scale  avoided \njurisdictional  avoided \ndeforestation  activity \ndeforestation activity). \n\nthe  scope  of  a \n\nfalling  within \n\n19. \n\nThis  risk  could,  for  example,  be  addressed  in  mechanism  methodologies  by  requiring \nagreement  between  the  entities  that  may  potentially  seek  carbon  credits  for  the  same \nemission reductions or removals. \n\n8.2.  Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes \n\n20. \n\nDouble  counting  may  occur  if  an  Article  6.4  activity  reduces  emissions  or  enhances \nremovals that are covered by a mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g. an emissions \n\n29 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\ntrading system). This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies \nby: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nExcluding  activities  or  not  issuing  Article  6.4  ERs  for  emission  reductions  or \nremovals that are subject to such overlap; or \n\nRequiring that measures are in place to ensure that any relevant impacts of the \nactivity (e.g., inter alia the GHG emission reductions achieved or the kilowatt-hours \nof  renewable  electricity  produced)  are  not  counted  towards  the  achievement  of \ntargets or obligations under the mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g., inter \nalia  by  cancelling  allowances  from  the  emissions  trading  system  before  issuing \ncarbon credits). \n\n8.3.  Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets \n\n21. \n\nDouble counting may occur if the mitigation outcomes achieved by an Article 6.4 activity \nare also claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets (e.g. guarantees of origin \nfor renewable electricity generation, green hydrogen schemes, low carbon fuel standards, \netc.). Note that this only holds if mitigation outcomes (e.g., emission reductions, removal \nenhancements, renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, etc.) are \nclaimed  in  other  frameworks  or  environmental  markets,  but  not  where  other  outcomes \n(e.g., air contaminant reductions or social impacts) are claimed. \n\n22. \n\nThis risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nExcluding  activities  or  not  issuing  Article  6.4  emission  reductions  for  emission \nreductions or removals that are subject to such overlap; or \n\nRequiring that the Article 6.4 activity does not claim the same mitigation outcomes \nin the relevant other environmental markets or accounting frameworks. \n\n9. \n\nMonitoring \n\n23.  Mechanism  methodologies shall  specify  procedures and methods for the  monitoring  all \ndata and parameters necessary to calculate the emission reductions or net removals from \nArticle 6.4 activities using the methodology. \n\n24. \n\nFurther requirements related to monitoring may be introduced in this standard in the future. \n\n10.  Aggregation of information \n\n25.  Where  appropriate,  mechanism  methodologies  may  consolidate  information  within  a \ngeographical  area  and  a  sector,  to  provide  observations  at  a  broader  level  than  an \nindividual  Article  6.4  activity.  Comparable  activities  can  be  grouped  or  aggregated  to \nprovide  a  broader  picture  when  this  does  not  lead  to  misrepresentation.  Comparable \nactivities can also be split or disaggregated, when this does not lead to misrepresentation, \nfor example when the sector shows great heterogeneity. \n\n11.  Validity and periodic updating of mechanism methodologies \n\n26. \n\nIn  accordance  with \nthe  “Procedure:  Development,  revision  and  clarification  of \nmethodologies  and methodological  tools”,  approved methodologies and methodological \ntools that have been applied in projects shall be reviewed on a regular basis. The review \nparticularly shall seek to incorporate, or substitute, sources and types of data, and update \nthe  methodological  approaches  and  assumptions,  to  enhance  the  application  of  the \n\n30 of 31 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-004 \nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nprinciples  and  general  requirements  in  section 4  of this  standard.  This may  include the \nadoption of new measurement approaches, such as the use of remote sensing and digital \ntechnologies. Each version of a mechanism methodology shall specify until when it is valid \nfor  use,  taking  into  account  the  methodological  approaches,  assumptions  and  data \nsources used in the methodology, as well as trends and developments in the sector. The \nvalidity shall not exceed five years. \n\n- - - - - \n\nDocument information  \n\nVersion \n\nDate \n\nDescription \n\n01.0 \n\n16 May 2025 \n\nSBM 016, Annex 12. \n\nInitial adoption. \n\nDecision Class: Regulatory  \nDocument Type: Standard \nBusiness Function: Methodology  \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, baseline scenario, methodologies, standardized baselines \n\n31 of 31 \n\n  \n \n \n\f"}, {"url": "https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-005.pdf", "title": "Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies", "text": "ARTICLE 6.4 MECHANISM \n\nA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \n\nStandard \n\nAddressing leakage in mechanism \nmethodologies \n\nVersion 01.0 \n\n \n \n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nPage \n\n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................  \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n1.1. \n\n1.2. \n\nScope .............................................................................................................  \n\nEntry into force ...............................................................................................  \n\nDEFINITIONS .............................................................................................................  \n\nAPPLICABILITY.........................................................................................................  \n\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS ....................................................................................  \n\nPROCEDURES TO ADDRESS LEAKAGE ...............................................................  \n\n5.1. \n\n5.2. \n\n5.3. \n\nIdentification of leakage .................................................................................  \n\nAvoidance or minimisation of leakage ...........................................................  \n\nCalculation and subtraction of leakage ..........................................................  \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n2 of 8 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n1.1.  Scope \n\n1. \n\nThis  standard  sets  out  requirements  for  mechanism  methodologies  to  first  identify \npotential sources of leakage, then seek to avoid or, where this is not possible, minimize \nany negative leakage, and subsequently calculate and subtract any remaining negative \nleakage of an Article 6.4 activity. \n\n1.2.  Entry into force \n\n2. \n\nThis document enters into force on 16 May 2025. \n\n2.  Definitions \n\n3. \n\nThe following definitions shall apply: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nActivity  participant:  A  public  or  private  entity  that  participates  in  an  Article 6.4 \nactivity; \n\nActivity boundary: The boundary that encompasses the greenhouse gas (GHG) \nsources, sinks and reservoirs that are controlled or related. The activity boundary \nmay also include GHG sources, sinks or reservoirs that are otherwise affected by \nthe activity;1 \n\nControlled sources, sinks and reservoirs: GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs \nthat  are  under  the  direction  and  influence  of  the  activity  participant  through \nfinancial, policy, management or other instruments; \n\nLeakage:  Changes  in  anthropogenic  emissions  and/or  removals  of  GHGs  that \noccur outside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity, including \nthose resulting from changes in market demand or supply for associated outputs. \nLeakage may involve the following sub-forms: \n\n(i) \n\nPositive  leakage:  Leakage  where  the  implementation  of  an  Article 6.4 \nactivity results in a decrease in emissions and/or an increase in removals; \n\n(ii)  Negative  leakage:  Leakage  where  the  implementation  of  an  Article 6.4 \n\nactivity results in an increase in emissions and/or a decrease in removals; \n\nLevel  of  service:  The  quality,  reliability  and  scale  of  an  output  provided  by  an \nArticle 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario; \n\nOutput:  Each  good  or  service  provided  by  the  Article 6.4  activity  and/or  in  the \nbaseline scenario2, as specified in the mechanism methodology; \n\n1   For  example,  for  activities  that  provide  renewable  electricity  to  the  grid  and  thereby  affect  electricity \ngeneration by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a \nbaseline  emission source  within the activity boundary.  Furthermore, note that in the case of activities \nimplemented at project-scale, the activity boundary is equivalent to the project boundary. \n\n2   For example, electricity, energy for cooking, or municipal waste management. \n\n3 of 8 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(g) \n\nRelated sources, sinks and reservoirs: GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs that \nhave material or energy flows into, out of, or within the Article 6.4 activity. \n\n3.  Applicability \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nThis standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions \nand net removals. \n\nThis  version  of  the  standard  is  applicable  to  mechanism  methodologies  for  activities \nundertaken  at  the  project  level.  The  standard  may  be  amended  in  the  future  to  cover \nmethodologies  addressing  mitigation  actions  at  other  scales  (e.g.,  programmes  of \nactivities, policies, sectoral approaches). \n\nThe  standard  applies  to  mechanism  methodologies  and  methodological  tools.  For \nsimplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. \n\n4.  General requirements \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\nMechanism methodologies shall include all leakage sources in the calculation of emission \nreductions or net removals, unless their exclusion is conservative (e.g., the exclusion of a \nsource  of  positive  leakage).  Where  the  proponent  of  a  mechanism  methodology  can \ndemonstrate that, for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology, \ncertain  positive  leakage  sources  are  consistently  larger  than  certain  negative  leakage \nsources,  then  these  leakage  sources  may  be  omitted  in  the  calculation  of  emission \nreductions and/or net removals. \n\nThe proponent of mechanism methodologies shall assess whether the implementation of \nArticle 6.4 activities covered by the methodology could lead to any changes in the type(s) \nof output or level(s) of service provided as compared to the baseline scenario. When the \ntype(s)  of  output  or  the  level(s)  of  service  provided  in  the  Article 6.4  activity  scenario \nchange compared to the baseline scenario, this can result in leakage3. Such leakage shall \neither be: \n\n(a) \n\nPrevented by designing the Article 6.4 activity in such a way that the same type(s) \nof output or level(s) of service is provided in the Article 6.4 activity scenario as in \nthe  baseline  scenario  (e.g.,  by  providing  respective  applicability  conditions  or \nexpanding the geographical activity boundary); or \n\n(b) \n\nAddressed by quantifying and subtracting any negative leakage resulting from the \nchange in the type(s) of output or level(s) of service. \n\nThe relevant geographical area for consideration of leakage may not be limited to national \nboundaries  and  shall  include  international  leakage  (i.e.,  leakage  beyond  national \nboundaries) where this occurs. \n\nIf the sum of all sources of leakage results in a net decrease in GHG emissions or increase \nin GHG removals, then the resulting leakage shall be set equal to zero in the quantification \nof the emission reductions or net removals. \n\n3   For example, a renewable power plant constructed on agricultural land could lead to a change in the \n\ntype or level(s) of agricultural production. \n\n4 of 8 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n5.  Procedures to address leakage \n\n11.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  contain  provisions  to  first  identify  potential  sources  of \nleakage,  then  seek  to  avoid  or,  where  this  is  not  possible,  to  minimize  any  negative \nleakage and subsequently calculate and subtract any remaining negative leakage as per \nthe specifications below. \n\n5.1. \n\nIdentification of leakage \n\n12. \n\nThe proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all potential sources of leakage \nfor the type of mitigation activities covered by the methodology. This shall include, but not \nbe limited to, the following sources of leakage: \n\n(a) \n\nBaseline equipment transfer: This source of leakage is relevant where: \n\n(i) \n\nEquipment used within the activity boundary prior to the implementation of \nthe Article 6.4 activity would continue to be used in the baseline scenario and \nis being replaced under the Article 6.4 activity scenario; and \n\n(ii)  The replaced equipment is functional, has a value for third parties and could \ncontinue to be used outside of the activity boundary where it may potentially \ndisplace less GHG intensive processes4; \n\n(b) \n\nCompetition for resource use5: This source of leakage is relevant where: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Article  6.4  activity  increases,  relative  to  the  baseline  scenario,  the \nconsumption of resources that have competing uses; \n\n(ii)  The availability  of  the resources  is  limited  within the  relevant  geographical \n\narea; and \n\n(iii)  The  potential  diversion  of  the  resources  from  other  uses  to  the  Article  6.4 \nactivity  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  GHG  gas  emissions  or  decrease  of \nremovals outside the activity boundary; \n\n(c) \n\nDiversion of existing production processes or outputs: This source of leakage is \nrelevant where6: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  type(s)  of  output  or  level(s)  of  services provided  under the  Article 6.4 \nactivity changes compared to the baseline scenario; and \n\n4   For example, this may occur as a result of replacing a fossil-fuel boiler with a biomass boiler where the \n\nfossil-fuel boiler is re-used in another location. \n\n5  For example, this may happen where biomass is used to replace fossil fuel but the resulting scarcity in \nbiomass leads current biomass users to switch to fossil-fuels. Another example is the use of agricultural \nby-products  as  fuels  or  feedstocks,  where  the  diversion  of  biomass  from  application  on  fields  to \nalternative uses may result in an increased use of synthetic fertilizer. \n\n6   For  example,  this  may  be  applicable  to  activities  that  involve,  shifting  pre-project  activities,  such  as \ngrazing or agriculture, outside of the activity boundary, as a result of changes in management or use of \nland. \n\n5 of 8 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(ii)  The  change  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  emissions  and/or  a  decrease  in \n\nremovals outside the activity boundary7; \n\n(d) \n\nIncreases in release of GHGs from the environment as a result of  implementing \nthe Article 6.4 activity.8 \n\n13. \n\nThe requirement in paragraph 12(b) above may not apply to fossil fuels or mineral products \nconsidering that their availability can be expanded through increased extraction in case of \nincreased demand. \n\n5.2.  Avoidance or minimisation of leakage \n\n14.  Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to seek to avoid or, where this is not \npossible, to minimize all identified sources of negative leakage by applying, inter alia, the \napproaches below as appropriate for the given sector and the type of mitigation activities \ncovered by the methodology. Avoiding or minimizing leakage may be done, for example, \nby limiting the scope of applicability conditions, as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIf  baseline  equipment  transfer  is  identified  as  a  potential  source  of  leakage, \nmechanism  methodologies  can  include  applicability  conditions  that  require  the \ndestruction, decommission or disposal of the baseline equipment and the provision \nof relevant evidence9; \n\nIf  competition  for  resource  use  is  identified  as  a  potential  source  of  leakage, \nmechanism  methodologies  can  include  applicability  conditions  to  demonstrate \nabundance  of  such  resource  and  that  such  resource  would  not  be  used  in  the \nbaseline  scenario.  Abundance  demonstrations  shall  be  based  on  requirements \nprovided  for  in  methodologies  and  shall  account  for  the  economic  and \nenvironmental impacts of diverting resources from prior use cases, including with \nrespect to the sustainable use of natural or human-managed ecosystems;10 \n\n(c) \n\nIf changes in the type of output(s) or level(s) of service are identified as a potential \nsource of leakage, mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions \nrequiring the demonstration of equivalence of output(s) and level(s) of service.11 \n\n15. \n\nAs per paragraph 87 of the Methodologies Standard12, if the proposed activity falls under \nthe  scope  of  Article  5,  paragraph  2,  of  the  Paris  Agreement  (i.e.,  REDD+  activities), \nmechanism methodologies shall further require demonstration that the activity is included \n\n7   For example, this may occur where agricultural production is reduced because of the activity and new \n\nproduction is established on land that was previously forested. \n\n8   For example, this may consist in increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils in a wetland if the water \nlevel is lowered due to the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity due to an activity on a neighboring \nland. \n\n9   For  example,  methodologies  can  establish  applicability  conditions  to  require  baseline  refrigeration \n\nequipment to undergo refrigerant recovery and destruction as well as scrapping of the equipment. \n\n10  For example, methodologies can establish applicability conditions to prevent soil depletion by requiring \n\nthat a minimum amount of biomass must be retained per unit of land. \n\n11  For example, if reforestation Article 6.4 activities could result in diversion of pre-project activities such as \nagriculture,  mechanism  methodologies  can  include  conditions  which  limit  applicability  to  activities  on \ndegraded lands which do not result in such diversion. \n\n12 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf. \n\n6 of 8 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nin all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71. This \ndemonstration  shall  be  done  using  official  documentation  from  the  host  country \ncommunicated to the UNFCCC secretariat pursuant to relevant guidance and decisions, \nas follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nThe  proposed  A6.4  activity  is  included  in the  host  country’s  national  strategy  or \naction plan referred to in decision 1/CP.16, para 71(a); \n\nInclusion of the geographical activity boundary in the host country’s national forest \nreference  emission  level  and/or  forest  reference  level  referred  to  in  decision \n1/CP.16, para 71(b); \n\nInclusion  of  the  geographical  activity  boundary  in  the  national  forest  monitoring \nsystem referred to in decision 1/CP.16, para 71(c); \n\nThe proposed A6.4 activity is included in and reports to the system for providing \ninformation on safeguards referred to in 1/CP.16, para 71(d) (without prejudice to \nthe use of the SD Tool). \n\n16. \n\nIf the proposed A6.4 activity is not yet included in all the elements required of the host \nParty as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, mechanism methodologies may require, on \nan interim basis, a letter from the host country’s national entity or focal point referred to in \ndecision 2/CP.10 (i.e., the REDD+ focal point) indicating when the proposed A6.4 activity \nwill  be  included  in  all  the  elements  above.  The  inclusion  shall  occur  no  later  than \nVerification and be verified by the DOE. \n\n5.3.  Calculation and subtraction of leakage \n\n17. \n\nIf negative leakage cannot be avoided through measures such as those indicated in the \npreceding  section,  mechanism  methodologies  shall  include  procedures  to  calculate  the \nremaining net leakage (i.e., the balance of any positive and negative leakage) and, should \nthe net leakage be negative, subtract it in the quantification of emission reductions or net \nremovals. \n\n18.  Where baseline equipment transfer cannot be avoided by measures such as destruction, \ndecommissioning or disposal of the baseline equipment, mechanism methodologies shall \nprovide approaches to calculate any resulting negative leakage from continued use of the \nequipment.  Such  approaches  may  need  to  consider:  the  remaining  lifetime  of  the \nequipment, the possible usage scenarios and the usage rate of the equipment (e.g., how \nmany  hours  within  a  year  the  equipment  is  used),  the  GHG  emissions  intensity  of  the \ntransferred  equipment  and  the  type  and  GHG  intensity  of  the  equipment  that  is  being \nreplaced by the transferred equipment. \n\n19.  Where  the  use  of  competing  resources  cannot  be  avoided  through  demonstration  of \nabundance and non-use in the baseline scenario, mechanism methodologies shall include \nprocedures to account for any resulting negative leakage. Such procedures may include \nconsideration  of  the  quantity  of  resources  used  under  the  Article  6.4  activity  that  are \nsubject to competing uses, the likely alternatives to those resources, and the associated \nemissions or removals resulting from the use of those alternatives. \n\n20.  Where the type(s) of output and/or level(s) of service in the Article 6.4 activity scenario \ndiffer from those in the baseline scenario (e.g., due to diversion of production processes \nor outputs), mechanism methodologies shall specify the approach to quantify and subtract \nany  resulting  negative  leakage  in  the  calculation  of  emission  reductions  and/or  net \n\n7 of 8 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-005 \nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nremovals. The approach shall ensure that leakage arising from changes in the type(s) of \noutput and/or level(s) of service is appropriately accounted for.13 \n\n21. \n\nArticle  6.4  activities  are  ineligible  to  earn  A6.4  emission  reductions  where  the \nimplementation of the Article 6.4 activity leads to a decrease in the type(s) of output and/or \nlevel(s) of service relative to the baseline scenario, unless the mechanism methodology \nfully accounts for any negative leakage effects resulting from the decrease in the type(s) \nof  output  and/or  level(s)  of  service  in  the  calculation  of  emission  reductions  and/or  net \nremovals  and  the  proponent  of  the  mechanism  methodology  provides  appropriate \njustifications for the full consideration. \n\n- - - - - \n\nDocument information \n\nVersion \n\nDate \n\nDescription \n\n01.0 \n\n16 May 2025 \n\nSBM 016, Annex 13. \n\nInitial adoption.  \n\nDecision Class: Regulatory \nDocument Type: Standard \nBusiness Function: Methodology \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, leakage, methodologies \n\n13  For example, improved forest management activities, such as extending the rotation age of trees, may \nreduce the level of timber harvesting.

Another example is a reforestation activity \nthat  could  result  in  diversion  of  pre-project  activities,  such  as  agriculture.

Scope \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nThis Standard sets out requirements for recognizing suppressed demand in mechanism \nmethodologies. This Standard aims to facilitate a consistent and appropriate consideration \nof  approaches for  addressing  suppressed  demand.  It  provides  requirements  on  how to \nidentify  the  service  level  that  fulfils  basic  human  needs  and  identify  the  baseline \ntechnology and/or practice where suppressed demand exists, and the means to monitor \nwhether suppressed demand conditions persist during the crediting period. \n\nThe Standard will be applied by the mechanism methodology proponents developing new \nmechanism methodologies or proposing revisions to existing ones, and by the secretariat, \nthe  Methodological  Expert  Panel  (MEP)  and  the  Supervisory  Body  in  assessing  and \nconsidering  proposed  mechanism  methodologies  for  approval.  The  standard  is  not \nintended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or monitoring reports. \n\n1.2.

Definitions \n\n4. \n\nThe following definitions shall apply: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\nActivity  participant:  A  public  or  private  entity  that  participates  in  an  Article  6.4 \nactivity; \n\nBasic human needs: Physical and physiological needs considered essential for \nminimum  quality  of  life,  such  as  water,  food,  housing,  sanitation  (waste \ntreatment/disposal,  and  wastewater  treatment),  access  to  energy  services \n(including  lighting,  cooking,  and  thermal  comforts  including  heating  or  cooling), \nmobility, communications and education, health and economic activities such as \nagriculture; \n\nBusiness-as-usual (BAU): Plausible reference benchmark or scenario for GHG \nemissions  or  removals  prior  to  or  in  the  absence  of  the  implementation  of  the \nproposed Article 6.4 activity. It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an \nemissions or removals intensity; \n\nLevel  of  service:  The  quality,  reliability  and  scale  of  an  output  provided  by  an \nArticle 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario; \n\nLevel of service for meeting basic human needs: The threshold below which \nan individual is considered to face deprivation of basic human needs; \n\nSuppressed  demand:  A  situation  where  services  provided  to  a  population  are \ninsufficient to meet the basic human needs due to barriers, such as low income or \nlack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting \nsuch needs requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline \nscenarios; \n\n3 of 10 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-006 \nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n(g) \n\nSuppressed  demand  baseline:  A  crediting  baseline  that  is  established  for  the \nprovision of services that address basic human needs. \n\n3.  Applicability \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nThe  standard  applies  to  mechanism  methodologies  and  methodological  tools.  For \nsimplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. \n\nThe standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to emission reductions. It does \nnot apply to mechanism methodologies for activities involving removals1. \n\n7. \n\nMechanism methodologies may recognise suppressed demand where: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nNeither  the  existing  conditions,  nor  those  in  the  BAU  scenario  can  realistically \nprovide the  level  of  service for meeting  the  basic  human  needs  of  a  population; \nand \n\nThese conditions are likely to persist throughout the crediting period due to barriers \nsuch as low income, lack of capital, or inadequate infrastructure. \n\n8. \n\nThis standard applies to the following contexts: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nThe  residential  context,  which  may  include  the  energy  use  for  lighting,  cooking, \nfood  preservation,  communication,  space  heating  and  cooling;  and  safe  water \nsupply; \n\nThe  non-residential  context,  which  may  include  energy  use  by  smallholder \nagriculture  (e.g.,  milling,  drying,  cold  storage);  energy  for  health  centres \n(e.g., lighting,  cold  storage,  cooking,  space  heating  and  cooling);  energy  for \nschools (e.g., lighting, cooking, space heating and cooling, powering of teaching \nand learning devices); \n\n(c) \n\nOther areas, such as mobility, construction or waste management. \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\nThis standard provides specifications for the energy consumption to meet basic human \nneeds for the residential and non-residential sector but does not yet provide specifications \nfor  other  areas.  Such  specifications  may  be  proposed  in  submissions  of  mechanism \nmethodologies. Note that the standard also does not provide values for the level of service \nfor meeting specific basic human needs in the residential and non-residential context. \n\nThis  standard  shall  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  “Standard  Setting  the  baseline  in \nmechanism  methodologies”  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “Baseline  Standard”).2  This \npresent  standard  specifies  which  provisions  in  the  Baseline  Standard  do  not  apply  to \nsuppressed demand baselines. \n\nThe standard applies to activities undertaken at the project level and may be amended in \nthe  future  to  cover  mechanism  methodologies  addressing  mitigation  actions  at  other \nscales (e.g., programme-of-activities, policies, sectoral approaches). \n\n1  Stakeholders  may  identify  the  need  to  widen  the  applicability  of  this  standard  to  activities  involving \nremovals, by presenting specific proposals for the application of suppressed demand in removals activity \nin new proposed mechanism methodologies. \n\n2  Refer  A6.4-STAN-METH-004  available  at  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-\n\nMETH-004.pdf. \n\n4 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-006 \nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n4.  General principles and requirements \n\n4.1.  General principles \n\n12. \n\nThe principles in the Baseline Standard shall apply, with an exception to the principle of \nconservativeness which is defined as follows: \n\n(a) \n\nConservativeness: In the context of suppressed demand, conservativeness is the \nuse  of  data,  parameters,  assumptions,  and  methods,  to  ensure  that  neither  the \nbaseline  emissions  nor  the  level  of  service  for  meeting  basic  human  needs  are \noverestimated. \n\n4.2.  Requirements \n\n13.  When addressing suppressed demand, the mechanism methodology shall: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nSpecify which basic human need(s) it addresses and the metric and threshold to \nbe used for such need(s); \n\nSpecify  the  type(s)  of  technology  and/or  practice  that  will  provide  the  level  of \nservice for meeting basic human needs. \n\n14. \n\nThe total level of service required to meet basic human needs shall be applied consistently \nacross countries, regardless of the technology and/or practice that a project activity uses \nto address those basic human needs. \n\n5.  Approaches for recognising suppressed demand \n\n5.1.  Determination  of  the  underlying  conditions  for  recognising  suppressed \n\ndemand \n\n15.  When addressing suppressed demand, the mechanism methodology shall require activity \nparticipants  to  demonstrate  that  the  intended  project  beneficiaries  are  in  suppressed \ndemand conditions with respect to the identified basic human need(s) at the start of each \ncrediting  period  and  that  these  conditions  are  likely  to  persist  throughout  the  crediting \nperiod. \n\n16.  Mechanism methodologies shall specify the sectors and characteristics and scale of the \n\nactivity types that they cover for determining a suppressed demand baseline. \n\n5.2. \n\nIdentification of the level of service for meeting basic human needs \n\n17.  Mechanism  methodologies  shall  define  the  specific  context  to  which  the  mechanism \nmethodology  is  applicable  and  the  level  of  service  for  meeting  basic  human  needs  for \nwhich  a  suppressed  demand baseline  may  be  applied  to  calculate  baseline  emissions. \nThis  applies  both  when  the  technology  and/or  practices  provided  under  the  Article  6.4 \nactivity cover one or more basic human need(s). However, the level of service for meeting \nbasic human needs shall be established separately for each basic human need. \n\n5 of 10 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-006 \nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n18. \n\nThe thresholds for the level of service for meeting basic human needs are defined as: \n\n(a) \n\nFor  suppressed  demand  in  residential  energy  consumption,  the  specific  basic \nhuman  need values  shall  be  derived,  and  appropriately  justified,  consistent  with \nthe following threshold values. For total energy consumption: \n\n(i) \n\nTotal electricity consumption up to 250 kWh per person per year3; and \n\n(ii)  For total useful energy delivered from fuel used for cooking and heating up \n\nto 2.1 Gigajoules (equivalent to 583 kWh) per person per year4; \n\n(b) \n\nFor suppressed demand in non-residential energy consumption, deemed relevant \nto meet basic human needs, as described in the definition of basic human needs, \nthe relevant specific basic human need values shall be derived, and appropriately \njustified, consistent with the following threshold value for total direct and indirect \nelectricity consumption up to 750 kWh per person per year5. \n\nThe  threshold  for  the  level  of  service  for  meeting  basic  human  needs,  as  outlined  in \nparagraph 18, shall be applied in general as a default approach. Proposals for alternative \nvalues  may  be  included  in  the  mechanism  methodology  or  tool  by  the  methodology \nproponents or proposed by a host Party6 for the recommendation by the MEP and approval \nby the Supervisory Body. \n\nFurther, globally applicable values for the level of service for meeting basic human needs \nfor other areas may be developed in future revisions to this standard. These values may \ninclude the identification and recognition of indirect energy demand for services required \nto meet basic human needs in the residential or non-residential context. \n\n19. \n\n20. \n\n21.  Mechanism methodologies establishing suppressed demand baselines may use energy \nmetrics and non-energy metrics to determine the level of service for meeting basic human \nneeds. Where non-energy metrics are used, the metrics for the level of service for meeting \nthe basic human needs proposed by proponents of mechanism methodologies shall be \ncomparable to those in paragraphs 18(a) and 18(b) above. \n\n3  As defined in the Modern Energy Minimum https://modernenergyminimum.org. \n\n4  Adapted from the figure of 50kg-oil equivalent of modern fuel in Level 1 of energy access according to \nThe Secretary -General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC), 2010, Energy for a \nSustainable Future: Report and Recommendations  \nhttps://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/publications/AGECCsummaryreport.pdf. \n\n5  As defined in the Modern Energy Minimum https://modernenergyminimum.org. \n\n6  Through the proposal of a standardized baseline.  \n\n6 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-006 \nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\n22. \n\nFor establishing the level of service for meeting a specific basic human need, the following \ndata  sources  may  be  used,  and  it  should  be  demonstrated  all  data  sources  are  peer \nreviewed 7: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nNational or international research8; \n\nRelevant studies and reports from multilateral organizations9; \n\nEstablished  benchmarks  related  to  international  and/or  national  development \ngoals10. \n\n23. \n\nFurther, for establishing the level of service for meeting a specific basic human need, the \nfollowing shall be taken into account: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nClimatic zones11; \n\nPolicy and regulations; \n\nScale and proportionality to the metric for the total level of service for meeting basic \nhuman  needs  for  the  relevant  context,  as  defined  under  paragraphs  18  and  19 \nabove. \n\n24. \n\n25. \n\n26. \n\nIn  some  situations,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  apply  two  or  more  baseline  technologies \nand/or  practices  and  respective  service  levels  to  reflect  the  cumulative  project  service \nlevel. \n\nThe level of service for a specific basic human need shall represent a reasonable fraction \nof the total level of service for meeting basic human needs for the relevant context, when \nit is defined in this standard under paragraph 18 and 19 above. For example, a mechanism \nmethodology  for  Article  6.4  activities  that  provide  lighting  services  for  households  shall \nspecify the limit for lighting based on a reasonable and justifiable distribution for different \nconsumption percentages of the services in the relevant geographical area. \n\nThe sum of the individual thresholds for each service shall not exceed the threshold for \nthe total level of service for meeting basic human needs for residential electric energy use, \nconsidering also other electric energy services required by the household to meet its basic \nhuman needs such as space cooling and heating, food preservation and communications. \nThe same would apply for an Article 6.4 activity that provides combinations of services for \n\n7 \n\nIn case no peer-review is conducted, it should be demonstrated all data sources have gone through a \nsimilar review process. \n\n8  For example, Table 2 of the following article can be used to estimate the proportions of specific needs \nfrom the value of total Decent Living Standards. The proportions from this source may be considered by \nmethodology proponents in estimating the proportion of each specific need from the total BHN threshold: \nJ. Millward-Hopkins, J. K.

Mechanism methodologies shall use the provisions in the Baseline Standard to determine \nthe  baseline  scenario  and  the  baseline  technology  and/or  practice  for  the  suppressed \ndemand baseline, subject to the following requirements: \n\n(a) \n\nRather than a service level that reflects existing conditions or a BAU scenario, the \nbaseline shall be determined for the lower of: \n\n(i) \n\nThe level of service for meeting basic human needs; or \n\n(ii)  The level of service delivered by the mitigation activity; \n\n(b) \n\nThe  identified  baseline  technology  and/or  practice  shall  be  able  to  realistically \nprovide the level of service referred to in sub-paragraph 29(a)(i) above; \n\n(c)  When applying the existing actual or historical emissions approach, the approach \nis not required to utilize site-specific historical data but may instead use another \nmethod that reflects the actual or historical emissions of the baseline technology \nor practice; \n\n(d) \n\nThe suppressed demand baseline may be based on a technology and/or practice \nthat can be demonstrated through studies, documents, or third-party records, but \n\n8 of 10 \n\n  \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-006 \nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nis  not  well  documented  in  official  records  or  data12,  whereby  the  supporting \nevidence for the baseline may not comply entirely with the Data requirements for \nbaseline setting and quantification in the Baseline Standard. The types of alternate \nstudies,  documents,  or  third-party  records  permissible  as  evidence  shall  be \nspecified in the mechanism methodology; \n\nThe downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3 of the Baseline Standard \nmay be used as the crediting baseline. The determination of a conservative BAU \nbaseline, as per Step 3 and section 7 of the Baseline Standard, is not necessary \nand the downward adjusted baseline does not need to undergo a comparison with \nBAU or fulfil the requirement of being below BAU; \n\nThe downward adjustment in subsequent years, as referred to in section 7.2 of the \nBaseline Standard, may correspond to the minimum value of 1 per cent; \n\nThere is no need for consideration of rebound effects, as referred to in Appendix 1 \nto the Baseline Standard. \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n30. \n\nThe suppressed demand baseline shall be re-evaluated and updated at the renewal of the \ncrediting period to ensure it is based on the current situation. \n\n5.4.  Monitoring of suppressed demand conditions \n\n31.  Mechanism methodologies shall include requirements for activity participants to monitor \nand reassess whether ongoing conditions continue, to indicate that suppressed demand \nwould persist in the absence of the Article 6.4 activity, using one or more indicators as \ndescribed in sub-paragraph 31(a) below. The mechanism methodology shall specify the \nindicator(s) and threshold(s) to be used by activity participants to monitor and reassess \nongoing suppressed demand conditions, as follows: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIndicators  may  be  parameters  such  as  average  household  income,  distance  to \nelectrical  substations,  grid  reliability,  distance  to  water  treatment  plants  in \ncompliance with potability standards, or others relevant for the basic human needs \nbeing addressed and the conditions of the project population prior to the project \nactivity; \n\nThe monitoring  to assess  ongoing  suppressed demand  conditions  shall exclude \nthe  direct  impact  of  the  Article  6.4  activity  on  the  conditions  of  the  project \npopulation. \n\n32. \n\n33. \n\nThe mechanism methodology shall include a provision to require activity participants to \nundertake the reassessment of ongoing suppressed demand conditions at least every five \nyears, e.g., at the renewal of the crediting period. \n\nIf  the  ongoing  conditions  of  an  activity  are  found  to  exceed  the  threshold  defined  as \nmeeting suppressed demand, then that location is deemed ineligible for the baseline for \nwhich suppressed demand is recognized, and a new baseline may be proposed following \nan  approved  mechanism  methodology  via  the  post-registration  changes  procedure,  as \nreferred to in the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”. \n\n- - - - - \n\n12  For example, diesel gensets in a context where these are widely used by individuals but not tracked or \n\nreported reliably by the national government. \n\n9 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-STAN-METH-006 \nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies \nVersion 01.0 \n\nDocument information \n\nVersion \n\nDate \n\nDescription \n\n01.0 \n\n7 August 2025 \n\nSBM 017, Annex 5. \n\nInitial adoption. \n\nDecision Class: Regulatory  \nDocument Type: Standard \nBusiness Function: Methodology  \nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, suppressed demand, methodologies \n\n10 of 10 \n\n  \n \n\f"}, {"url": "https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-TOOL-AC-001.pdf", "title": "Article 6.4 sustainable development tool (Mandatory tool)", "text": "ARTICLE 6.4 MECHANISM \n\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001  \n\nTool \n\nArticle 6.4 sustainable development tool \n\nVersion 01.1 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fA6.4-TOOL-AC-001  \nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool \nVersion 01.1 \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nPage \n\n1. \n\nINTRODUCTION ........................................................................................................  \n\n1.1. \n\nBackground ....................................................................................................  \n\n1.2.

Background \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nThe  Conference  of  the  Parties  serving  as  the  meeting  of  the  Parties  to  the  Paris \nAgreement  (CMA),  at  its  third  session,  adopted  the  rules,  modalities  and  procedures \n(RMPs) for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement \n(Article 6.4 mechanism)1 In the RMPs, the CMA further requested the Supervisory Body \nto  establish  the  requirements  and  processes  necessary  to  operate  the  mechanism, \nincluding those relating to the application of robust, social and environmental safeguards \nto Article 6.4 activities and/or A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs) and to develop tools \nand  approaches  for  assessing  and  reporting  information  about  how  each  activity  is \nfostering  sustainable  development,  while  acknowledging  that  the  consideration  of \nsustainable development is a national prerogative. \n\nThe  RMPs  also  recalled  the  eleventh  preambular  paragraph  of  the  Paris  Agreement, \n“Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should, \nwhen  taking  action  to  address  climate  change,  respect,  promote  and  consider  their \nrespective  obligations  on  human  rights,  the  right  to  health,  the  rights  of  Indigenous \nPeoples,  local  communities,  migrants,  children,  persons  with  disabilities  and  people  in \nvulnerable  situations  and  the  right  to  development,  as  well  as  gender  equality, \nempowerment of women and intergenerational equity”.2 \n\nThe adoption of the Article 6.4 sustainable development tool (hereinafter referred to as the \nA6.4  SD  Tool)  will  necessitate  updates  to  the  relevant  Article  6.4  standards  and \nprocedures. These updates will ensure alignment with the new A6.4 SD Tool requirements \nfor reporting, validation and verification. \n\nThe Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism, at its fourteenth meeting (SBM 014), \napproved the A6.4 SD Tool. \n\n1.2.  Objective \n\n5. \n\nThe objective of the A6.4 SD Tool is to ensure that Article 6.4 projects and/or Article 6.4 \nPoAs, collectively referred to as A6.4 activities, uphold the principle of “do no harm”, foster \nsustainable development (SD), and contribute to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs).3 \n\n1  Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Scope \n\n6. \n\nThe  A6.4  SD  Tool  applies  to  all  A6.4  activities 4  including  all  clean  development \nmechanism (CDM) activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism. \nIts scope encompasses the decisions of the CMA, which outline the formal expectations \nfor  the  Article 6.4  mechanism,  as  well  as  the  rules  and  requirements  developed  by  the \nSupervisory  Body  for  operationalizing  the  mechanism.5 Specifically,  the  tool  provides  a \nmeans  for  activity  participants  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  met  the  mandatory \nrequirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for \nassessing  and  enhancing  the  contributions  of  A6.4  activities  to  SD  in  line  with  SD \nobjectives and priorities of the host Party and the SDGs. \n\n7. \n\nTo achieve its objective, the tool provides a structured approach for activity participants \nto: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nConduct  a  risk  assessment  to  identify  risks  and  potential  impacts,  evaluate \nthem, and avoid harm where possible. When avoidance is not feasible, the A6.4 \nSD  Tool  instructs  participants  to  minimize  impacts  as  much  as  possible  and, \nfinally, to mitigate any remaining negative environmental and social impacts and \nrisks by establishing activity-level environmental and social indicators; \n\nIdentify  and  assess  potential  positive  and  negative  impacts  on  the  17 \nSustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  and  host  Party  SD  priorities  and \nestablish activity-level SD monitoring indicators; \n\nMonitor  and  report  the  outcomes  of  the  monitoring  against  the  established \nactivity-level environmental and social indicators and activity-level SD indicators. \n\n2.2.  Applicability \n\n8. \n\nThe use of the A6.4 SD Tool is mandatory for all proposed A6.4 activities, including all \nCDM activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism. \n\n2.3.  Entry into force \n\n9. \n\nVersion 01.0 of the A.6.4 SD Tool enters into force  on 9 October 2024. This document \nshall be reviewed every 18 months. \n\n4   In addition to this general  tool, additional safeguards  criteria and guiding  questions to  be applied for \ncarbon  dioxide  removal  activities  and  for  land  use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  activities  will  be \ndeveloped by the Supervisory Body as new annexes to include in this SD Tool at an appropriate stage \nin its development of regulations for activities involving removals. \n\n5  See Decision and documentation framework (A6.4-INFO-GOV-005) available at: \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-005.pdf. \n\n5 of 59 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-TOOL-AC-001  \nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool \nVersion 01.1 \n\n3.  Article 6.4 Sustainable Development Tool \n\nimplementation \n\n3.1.  Overview of the A6.4 SD Tool \n\n10. \n\n11. \n\nThe A6.4 SD Tool requires activity participants to identify, evaluate, avoid, minimize, and \nmitigate potential risks associated with proposed A6.4 activities. \n\nActivity  participants  of  A6.4  activities  shall  adopt  mitigation  strategies to  avoid  risks  or, \nwhere  complete  avoidance  is  not  possible  and  activity  implementation  is  nonetheless \npermitted, minimize and mitigate identified risks. \n\n12.  Where complete avoidance of risk is not possible, activity participants of A6.4 activities \nshall  provide  evidence,  including  monitoring  of  activity-level  environmental  and  social \nindicators, that the A6.4 activities comply with the environmental and social safeguarding \nelements and criteria as defined in section 6 of this tool, including those relevant to the \neleventh  preambular  paragraph  of  the  Paris  Agreement, 6  as  well  as  relevant  and \napplicable  national  and  international  instruments  to  which  the  host  Party  is  bound  and \napplicable legislation in the host Party (see figures 1 and 2). Such international instruments \nmay include, for example, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the \nInternational Labour Organization fundamental conventions, and recognized international \nbest practices. \n\n13. \n\n Activity participants are also required to: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nIdentify  and  assess  the  potential  positive  and  negative  impacts  of  their  A6.4 \nactivities on the SD of the host Party(ies), by considering the host Party(ies)’ SD \nobjectives and priorities, as well as the SDGs; \n\nEstablish activity-level SD indicators; and \n\nMonitor and report the outcome against the established indicators (see figures 1 \nand 3 and section 7.1). \n\n3.2.  Navigating the A6.4 SD Tool \n\n14. \n\nThe  A6.4  SD  Tool  is  divided  into  three  key  sections  covering  important  processes,  as \nfollows: \n\n(a) \n\nSection  6  Environmental  and  social  safeguards:7 This  section  focuses  on \nelements and criteria that serve as the basis for activity participants to identify, \nevaluate,  avoid,  minimize,  and  mitigate  potential  negative  environmental  and \nsocial impacts and risks that may arise during the implementation and operation \nof  the  A6.4  activity,  or  CDM  activity  transitioning  the  Article  6.4  mechanism. \nActivity  participants  are  required  to  conduct  a  risk  assessment  based  on \nsafeguards’ elements and criteria as defined under Section 6, which leads to the \ndevelopment of A6.4 Environmental and social management action plans. These \nplans  include  activity-level  environmental  and  social  indicators  for  tracking \nactions and acceptance criteria to demonstrate that the impacts and risks do not \n\n6  See footnote 2. \n\n7  Environmental and social safeguards commonly observed in other UN agencies, international financial \n\ninstitutions and voluntary carbon market systems. \n\n6 of 59 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-TOOL-AC-001  \nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool \nVersion 01.1 \n\ncause harm to the environment or society. The outcomes of the risk assessment \nand the plans shall be documented in: \n\n(i)  A6.4-FORM-AC-015:  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  safeguards  risk \nassessment  form.  This  form  records  the  identification,  evaluation,  and \navoidance  of  environmental  and/or  social  risks  that  may  be  caused  by  a \nproposed A6.4 activity; \n\n(ii)  A6.4-FORM-AC-016:  A6.4  Environmental  and  social  management  plan \nform. This form details the set of minimization and mitigation measures and \nmonitoring to be implemented.  It shall be completed if the conclusion of the \nA6.4-FORM-AC-015 is “Yes” or “Potentially” (see figure 1 and figure 2). \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nSection  7.  Sustainable  development  impacts:  This  section  focuses  on \nidentifying the positive and negative SD impacts of the A6.4 activity, or a CDM \nactivity  transitioning to the  Article 6.4  mechanism. It  outlines the  processes for \nthe assessment of the SDGs impacted, the consideration of the host countries’ \nSD objectives and priorities, and the establishment of activity-level SD monitoring \nindicators  based  on  the  SDGs  and  their  targets.  All  activity  participants  shall \ndocument  the  evaluation  of  SD  impacts  and  the  measuring,  monitoring  and \nreporting  methodology \nthe  A6.4-FORM-AC-017:  A6.4  Sustainable \nin \ndevelopment impact form (see figure 1 and figure 3); \n\nSections 8 and 9. Validation and Verification: These sections outline additional \nrequirements to the Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standards \nfor  projects  and  programmes  of  activities  (VVS-P  -  VVS-PoA) 8 that  shall  be \nconsidered  by the  designated  operational  entities  (DOEs)  during the  validation \nand verification stages. \n\n3.3.  Stakeholder engagement and the A6.4 SD Tool \n\n15. \n\n16. \n\nStakeholders may submit issues and comments related to compliance with the A6.4 SD \nTool during the local stakeholder consultation and the global stakeholder consultation prior \nto the registration of the A6.4 activity.9 \n\nDuring the local stakeholder consultation, the three completed A6.4 SD Tool forms (see \nsub-paragraphs  14(a)  through  (b))  shall  be  shared  with  stakeholders  by  the  activity \nparticipants.10 Further,  during  the  global  stakeholder  consultation,  Parties,  stakeholders \nand  UNFCCC-admitted  observer  organizations  may  submit  comments  on  the  three \ncompleted  A6.4  SD  Tool  forms.

These rights, enshrined in national laws and international instruments, such \nas  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights, 40  establish  fundamental  standards  to \nensure  dignity,  equality  and  justice  for  all.  Consequently,  Article  6.4  supports  the \nimplementation of environmental and social safeguards in order to ensure that all activities \nare compliant with these human rights obligations. Additionally, Article 6.4 recognizes that \nhuman  rights  are  central  to  SD,  poverty  alleviation,  and  ensuring  fair  distribution  of \ndevelopment opportunities and benefits.

The  A6.4  activity  supports  the \navoidance  of  activity-related  land  acquisition  and  restrictions  on  land  use  that  lead  to \nadverse  impacts  on  communities  and  persons,  including  physical  displacement \n(relocation, loss of residential land or loss of shelter) and economic displacement (loss of \nland,  assets,  or  access to  assets,  leading to  loss  of  income  sources  or  other  means  of \nlivelihood).  Where  involuntary  resettlement  is  unavoidable,  it  is  to  be  minimized,  and \nappropriate  measures  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  on  displaced  persons  (and  on  host \ncommunities  receiving  displaced  persons)  are  to  be  carefully  consulted,  planned  and \nimplemented. \n\nE8 criteria: \n\nE8.1: In the implementation of the 6.4 activity, activity participants of the A6.4 activity are \nto avoid involuntary resettlement. \n\nE8.2: When physical displacement (i.e., relocation or loss of shelter) cannot be avoided, \nactivity participants of the A6.4 activity are to mitigate the displacement impacts on, and \nrisks for, displaced persons and host communities to, at minimum, restore their livelihoods \nand/or  living  standards  to  pre-project  levels.  If  the  A6.4  activity  involves  Indigenous \nPeoples, their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)47 must be obtained in accordance \nwith Element 9, included in section 6.4.6 of and in particular with criteria E9.5. \n\nE8.3: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to mitigate impacts and risks of economic \ndisplacement (loss of land, assets, or access to assets, leading to loss of income sources \nor other means of livelihood), when economic displacement cannot be avoided. \n\nE8.4: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to conduct a census and a socioeconomic \nbaseline  survey  to  identify  all  affected  individuals,  groups  or  communities  that  will  be \nphysically or economically displaced. A resettlement and/or livelihood action plans are to \nbe  integrated  into  A6.4-FORM-AC-016  (see  figure  1)  where  physical  displacement  is \ninvolved. The action plan will be developed in accordance with international best practices \n(e.g.  United  Nations  Development  Programme  Standard  5:  Displacement  and \nResettlement 48), in full consultation with the affected individuals, groups or communities \nand  based  on  good-faith  negotiations.  Resettlement  understandings  reached  by  the \nactivity participants with affected individuals, groups or communities are to be reflected in \nwritten agreements. \n\n46  Involuntary resettlement refers to a scenario when affected persons or communities do not have the right \n\nto refuse land acquisition or restrictions on land use that result in displacement. \n\n47  FPIC is a specific right of Indigenous Peoples recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples.

An activity participant identifies that their activity contributes to \nSDG 1462 and SDG 1563 based on the location of the proposed activity, which is near to \nthe marine and forest ecosystem. During the validation, the DOE raises a corrective action \nrequest  (CAR)  asking  the  activity  participants  to  clarify  how  the  proposed  activity’s \nimpact on SDG 14 and SDG 15 is direct and primary, as per section 7.1 of the applied tool. \nThe activity participants  acknowledge that  their  activity does not directly  contribute to \nSDG 14 and SDG 15 and excludes these contributions to SDG 14 and SDG 15 from A6.4-\nFORM-AC-017. Based on this revision, the DOE closes its CAR accordingly.  \n\n9.  Verification \n\n102.  The requirements relating to the verification for A 6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4 \nvalidation  and  verification  standards for  projects and  PoAs.64.  The  DOE  shall  verify the \nappropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of information provided in the monitoring of \nthe environmental and social indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4 activity-level SD \nindicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as reported in a monitoring report. \n\n103. \n\nIf the DOE observes any deviation from the information in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-\nFORM-AC-017 that were validated at the registration, it will provide its verification opinion \non the observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and \nenvironmental impact and/or SD impact defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-\n016 and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. \n\n104.  The DOE shall review any input and comments received via continuous engagement of \nlocal stakeholders in accordance with the AS-P or AS-PoA,65 conduct interviews with local \nstakeholders,  and  employ  professional  judgement  in  the  evaluation  of  the  ex-post \nfulfilment of risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity. \n\n105.  The  DOE  shall  confirm  that  the  activity  participants  have  measured,  monitored,  and \nreported  parameters  established  in  A6.4-FORM-AC-016  and  A6.4-FORM-AC-017 \nsubmitted at the registration stage. \n\n106. \n\nIf  the  DOE  identifies  unavoidable  negative  impacts  that  exceed  the  parameters \nestablished in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 and cannot be remediated \nby consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion as per \nthe  A6.4  validation  and  verification  standard  or  submit  a  deviation  request  to  the \nSupervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance. Box 2 below contains a best \npractice example of verification. \n\n62  SDG 14 (life below water) is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources \n\nfor sustainable development.

During  the  verification  of  the  number  of  jobs \ngenerated  under  SDG  8,  a  DOE  identifies  that  the  number  includes  short-term \nconstruction phase jobs and raises a CAR asking activity participants to clarify how the \ninclusion of short-term construction phase jobs aligns with section 7.1 of the applied tool, \nwhich  requires  SD  impact  to  be  significant  and  recurring/lasting  for  at  least  the  entire \ncrediting period of the activity. The activity participants acknowledge that the inclusion \nof short-term construction phase jobs is not in line with the SD impact defined in section \n7.1 of the applied tool, and the DOE closes the CAR by verifying a revised number that \ndoes not include short-term construction phase jobs.  \n\n66  SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) is to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic \ngrowth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8).  \n\n34 of 59 \n\n  \n \n\fA6.4-TOOL-AC-001  \nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool \nVersion 01.1 \n\nGuiding  questions \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nthe \nenvironmental and social safeguards  elements \nand criteria \n\nrisk  assessment  of \n\nInstruction \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nA6.4-FORM-AC-015  is  based  on  this  Appendix.

Activities involving removals \n\n9. \nFollowing  the  request  of  the  CMA  in  decision  7/CMA.4,  paragraphs  19–20,  the \nSupervisory Body considered the 289 inputs from Parties, observers and other stakeholders \nreceived through the structured public consultation process and work done by Supervisory \nBody  members  in  an  informal  working  group  to  elaborate  and  further  develop \nrecommendations  on  activities  involving  removals,  on  the  basis  of  the  RMPs.  The \nSupervisory  Body  will  continue  to  consider  this  matter  at  its  8th  meeting  and  report  on \nprogress in the addendum to this report.  \n\n2.  Application of the methodology requirements \n\n10. \nFollowing  the  requests  of  the  CMA  in  decision  7/CMA.4,  paragraphs  21–22,  the \nSupervisory Body considered the 34 inputs received from stakeholders through the structured \npublic consultation process and work done  by Supervisory Body members in an informal \nworking group to elaborate and further develop the recommendation on the application of the \nrequirements referred to in chapter V.B (Methodologies) of the RMPs. The Supervisory Body \nwill continue to consider this matter at its 8th meeting and report on progress in the addendum \nto this report.  \n\n3.  Transition of clean development mechanism activities \n\n11. \nSignificant  progress  was  made  regarding  the  transition  of  CDM  activities  to  the \nArticle  6.4  mechanism.  In  response  to  the  request  of  the  CMA  in  decision  7/CMA.4, \nparagraph 23(a), the Supervisory Body agreed to begin receiving requests for the transition \nof CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism from their project participants starting  on \n30 June 2023. Additionally, the Supervisory Body adopted the standard4 and procedure5 for \nthe transition process and agreed to make them effective from 1 January 2024, subject to the \navailability of detailed regulatory elements to enable the operationalization of the transition \nprocess. These elements are to be developed by the Supervisory Body. \n\n4.  Development of regulations and processes for implementing the mechanism \n\nestablished by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement \n\n12. \nThe work on regulatory documents related to projects continued to progress during \nthe reporting period. Following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a), \nthe Supervisory Body considered the activity standard, validation and verification standard, \n\n3  See Supervisory Body document A6.4-SB004-A01, available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-\nmeetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-body/meetings-of-the-article-64-\nsupervisory-body. \n\n4  Standard for the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism is available at \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb006-a01.pdf. \n\n5  Procedure for the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism is  available at \n\nhttps://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb006-a02.pdf. \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fFCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15 \n\nand  activity  cycle  procedure  for  projects  and  agreed  to  conduct  a  focused  and  inclusive \nstakeholder  interaction  thereon.  On  the  basis  of  the  draft  activity  cycle  procedure,  the \ndevelopment of information technology infrastructure needed to support the activity cycle \nprocedure will begin. In this regard, the Supervisory Body has also started  to work on the \nappeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Supervisory Body will \nconsider a first draft of the appeal and grievance procedure at its 8th meeting with a view to \nseeking input from stakeholders thereafter. \n\n13.  Also, following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a), as well \nas the provisions in paragraph 35 of the RMPs, the Supervisory Body adopted the following \nprocedures: “Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological \ntools” and “Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. The \narrangements  necessary for  operationalizing  these  procedures  are being  prepared  with  the \naim of operationalizing them during the first quarter of 2024. \n\n14. \nTo  fulfil  the  request  of  the  CMA  in  decision  3/CMA.3,  paragraph  5(b),  the \nSupervisory  Body  has  initiated  work  on  reviewing  the  baseline  and  monitoring \nmethodologies  in  use  for  the  CDM  with  a  view  to  applying  them  with  revisions,  as \nappropriate, for the activities under the Article 6.4 mechanism.  \n\n15.  Regarding the sustainable development tool, the Supervisory Body decided that using \nsuch a tool is mandatory in the Article 6.4 mechanism. Following the request of the CMA in \ndecision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(c), the Supervisory Body has been reviewing the sustainable \ndevelopment  tool  in  use  for  the  CDM  and  other  tools  and  safeguard  systems  in  use  for \nexisting  market-based  mechanisms  to  promote  sustainable  development  with  a  view  to \ndeveloping a similar tool for the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Supervisory Body will consider \na  first  draft  of  the  tool  at  its  8th  meeting  with  a  view  to  seeking  input  from  stakeholders \nthereafter.  \n\n16. \nFollowing the requests of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(d) and (e), the \nSupervisory Body has been reviewing the accreditation standards and procedures of the CDM \nwith a view to applying them with revisions, as appropriate, for the Article 6.4 mechanism \nby the end of 2023 and to approve the standard and procedure to be able to expeditiously \naccredit operational entities as designated operational entities. The Supervisory Body  will \ncontinue to consider this matter at its 8th meeting. \n\n17.  Once the accreditation standards and procedures are approved, the Supervisory Body \naims for the transition of CDM designated operational entities to the Article 6.4 mechanism \n(at  least  for  verification  of  transition  activities)  to  occur  by  the  second  quarter  of  2024, \nfollowing the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 24(b).  \n\n5.  Capacity-building programme \n\n18. \nProgress has been made regarding designing and implementing the capacity-building \nprogramme  aimed  at  assisting  Parties  wishing  to  voluntarily  participate  in  the  Article  6.4 \nmechanism.  Following  the  request  of  the  CMA  in  decision  3/CMA.3,  paragraph  14,  the \nsecretariat, in consultation with the Supervisory Body, has designed and started to implement \na  five-year  capacity-building  work  programme \nthe  secretariat’s  regional \ncollaboration centres.6 \n\nthrough \n\n6.
