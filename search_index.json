Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body of the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to  elaborate and further develop recommendations on the application of the requirements  referred to in chapter V.B (titled Methodologies) of the rules, modalities and procedures  for the Article 6.4 mechanism (RMPs)1 for consideration and adoption by the CMA at its  fourth session (November 2022). 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, requested the Supervisory Body to elaborate and further  develop recommendations for consideration and adoption by the CMA at its fifth session  (November–December 2023). It further requested the Supervisory Body, while developing  the recommendations, to consider broader inputs from stakeholders provided in a  structured public consultation process.2 1.2. Objectives 3. The objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for the development and  assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies. 2. Entry into force 4. This version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024. 3. Normative references 5. The “shall” requirements in this document are those that the user of this document (i.e.,  activity participants, host Parties, stakeholders, or the Supervisory Body) is obliged to  meet in order to claim conformance to this document. Other types of provisions in this  document include recommendations (“should”), permissions (“may”), possibilities and  capabilities (“can”) and items for inclusion in the work plan of the Supervisory Body (“will”).  Besides prescriptive recommendations, explanatory information is also included in this  document (e.g., summarizing the basis for or reasoning behind a requirement). 6. Reductions in emissions, increases in removals, as well as mitigation co-benefits of  adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans, are each and collectively  referred to as ”emission reductions or removals” (A6.4 ERs) in this document. 7. Mechanism projects, programmes of activities and component projects are collectively  referred to as “activity” or “activities” in this document. 1  See decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 6(d), for the request, available at  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10a01E.pdf#page_26 (English language  version), and the annex to 3/CMA.3 for the RMPs, contained in document  FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1. English version available at  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10a01E.pdf#page_29. 2  See decision 7/CMA.4, paras. 21 and 22, for the request, contained in document  FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/10/Add.2, available in all UN languages at https://unfccc.int/documents/626570.  3 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 8. The terms “technologies”, “measures” and “practices” are interchangeably used in this  document and refer to technologies, measures, and practices across all sectors. 9. Where scientific information is relied upon for methodologies, IPCC publications should  be considered as default source, if applicable and appropriate and unless more accurate  scientific information is available. 4. Methodology principles 10. Mechanism methodologies are intended to provide the basis for claim and assessment of  creditable emission reductions or removals, and whether activities satisfy additionality  requirements, and all relevant RMP and guidance from the SBM. 11. Paragraph 33 of the RMP applies to methodologies, and it is relevant to, inter alia,  baseline-setting, the avoidance of leakage, and the demonstration of additionality of  activities. 12. Paragraph 34 of the RMP sets out additional requirements, including with respect to  policies, national circumstances and reversals. 13. Paragraph 35 of the RMP frames the basic procedures for the development of  methodologies by host Parties, the Supervisory Body and activity participants. 14. Paragraph 36 of the RMP provides a choice of approaches for the baseline-setting and  requires the justification of the choice(s) made, including demonstration of consistency  with paragraph 33 of the RMP. 15. Paragraph 37 provides for host Parties and the Supervisory Body to develop standardized  baselines consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP. 16. Paragraph 38 of the RMP applies to the demonstration of additionality of activities and  identifies specific tests. 4.1. Encouraging ambition over time 17. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall encourage  ambition over time (…)”. 18. Mechanism methodologies shall apply increasingly ambitious baselines to encourage  ambition of activities over time, while taking into account host Party circumstances and  should facilitate the deployment of low carbon solutions and technologies as described in  paragraphs 19 and 20 below. 19. Mechanism methodologies should facilitate the deployment of technologies or measures  that are not widely used or available in specific locations, to facilitate knowledge transfer  and encourage deployment of technologies or measures that reduce the cost of  decarbonization and unlock investment in low-carbon solutions. 20. Mechanism methodologies should contain provisions that facilitate the inclusion of  progressively more efficient and less greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive technologies,  replicable and scalable mitigation activities, expanding the user base, broader geographic  coverage, and greater penetration of low-carbon solutions after initial deployment.  4 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 4.2. Being real, transparent, conservative, credible 21. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) be real,  transparent, conservative, credible (…)”. 22. Mechanism methodologies shall contain credible methods for estimating emission  reductions or removals to ensure that the results of Article 6.4 activities represent actual  tonnes of GHG emissions reduced or removed. Such estimations shall be based on up-  to-date scientific information and reliable data. 23. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require transparent descriptions  of the sources of data used, the assumptions made, the references used and the steps  followed in the estimation of the results of Article 6.4 activities, including equations where  necessary. 24. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that ensure conservative estimation of  emission reductions or removals from the measures applied, options chosen, or  assumptions made, and which should result in conservative estimates of the emission  reductions or removals from Article 6.4 activities. 25. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that Article 6.4 activities  have a robust monitoring, data capture and reporting system to ensure credibility. Where  secondary data is used, mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require  activity participants to provide justification that the source of data is appropriate, and the  data are conservative. 26. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to ensure that all emission reductions  or removals, are real, transparent, conservative, and credible by:  (a) Including robust, transparent and user-friendly measurement, reporting and  independent third-party verification systems;  (b) Requiring the use of technical performance standards that are data driven;  (c) Requiring transparent demonstration of changes in GHG emissions showing each  step in calculations and the results, and ensuring that calculated emission  reductions or removals are uniquely achieved by and attributable to the activity;  (d) Adopting life cycle approaches and considering emissions embodied in materials  and products, where relevant and practicable;  (e) Ensuring that information, including data sources and calculations are real,  transparent, conservative, accessible and credible;  (f) Choosing a conservative emissions baseline when multiple sources of data and  parameters are available to set the baseline;  (g) Including, where appropriate, the use of remote sensing and digital technologies  to enable transparent, accurate and credible calculation and estimation of emission  reductions and removals. 4.3. Establishing that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual 27. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) be below  ‘business as usual’ (…)”.  5 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 28. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that the baseline selected  for an emission reduction activity in accordance with paragraph 36 of the RMP shall be  demonstrated as being below ‘business-as-usual’ (BAU). BAU emissions are plausible  reference benchmarks or scenarios for GHG emissions prior to or in the absence of the  implementation of the activity. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall require  the identification of the BAU scenario or reference benchmark emissions and provide an  approach for their estimation. 29. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require activity participants to  calculate the difference between the baseline emissions estimated as per the  requirements in section 4.6 below and BAU emissions estimated as per paragraph 28  above as an annual and total amount with respect to the crediting period. This shall be  demonstrated in the project design document and at each renewal of the crediting period. 4.4. Contributing to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between  participating Parties 30. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall…contribute to the  equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between the participating Parties…”. 31. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions for contributing to the equitable  sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties, including the application of  conditions specified by the Designated National Authorities (DNAs) of the host Party.  These may also include one or more of the provisions below:  (a) Conditions to ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) of activities is  shorter than the lifetime of the technology implemented including any replacements  undertaken during the crediting period, where there is very high confidence that  emission reductions from the technology continue to be achieved beyond the end  of crediting period(s);  (b) Other approaches to fulfil the demonstration of equitable sharing of mitigation  benefits. 32. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that ensure that the sharing of  mitigation benefits between participating Parties tangibly supports the sustainable  development objectives of host Parties, such as through the use of the SD Tool in the  activity design and implementation. 33. Mechanism methodologies shall require the estimation of the mitigation benefits to the  host Party, taking into account the relevant provisions in paragraph 31 above. 4.5. Aligning with the NDC of each participating Party, if applicable, its LT-LEDS,  if it has submitted one, the long-term temperature goal of the Paris  Agreement and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement 34. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) in respect of  each participating Party, contribute to reducing emission levels in the host Party, and align  with its NDC, if applicable, its long-term low GHG emission development strategy, if it has  submitted one, and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement”. 35. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) align with the  long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (…)”.  6 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 36. Mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the activity, does not  constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party  with regard to the latest nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, if  applicable, its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-  LEDS), if it has submitted one, and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement  and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. 4.6. Approaches to set the baseline 37. Paragraph 36 of the RMP states that: “Each mechanism methodology shall require the  application of one of the approach(es) below to setting the baseline, while taking into  account any guidance by the Supervisory Body, and with justification for the  appropriateness of the choices, including information on how the proposed baseline  approach is consistent with paragraphs 33 and 35 in the RMP and recognizing that a host  Party may determine a more ambitious level at its discretion:  A performance-based approach, taking into account:  (i) Best available technologies that represent an economically feasible and  environmentally sound course of action, where appropriate;  (ii) An ambitious benchmark approach where the baseline is set at least at the  average emission level of the best performing comparable activities providing  similar outputs and services in a defined scope in similar social, economic,  environmental and technological circumstances;  (iii) An approach based on existing actual or historical emissions, adjusted  downwards to ensure alignment with paragraph 33 of the RMP.” 38. Paragraph 27 of the RMP states that “A host Party may specify to the Supervisory Body,  prior to participating in the mechanism: (a) Baseline approaches and other methodological  requirements…”. 39. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require justification of the  appropriateness of the choice of approach(es) identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP for  setting the baseline, with reference to the requirements of paragraphs 33 and 35 of the  RMP. 40. With regard to setting the baseline for emission reduction activities, factors affecting the  appropriateness of the choice may include:  (a) Similarity of emission sources with respect to technologies and measures applied,  or sectors covered by the methodology which may allow the use of an ambitious  benchmark covered under paragraph 36 (ii) of the RMP;  (b) Availability of data required for a conservative and reliable estimation of the  baseline. 41. For the approaches identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP, mechanism methodologies  shall contain provisions to apply the method detailed in section 4.7 below to adjust the  baseline emissions downwards and to ensure consistency with paragraph 33 of the RMP. 42. A host Party may determine a more ambitious baseline requirement at its discretion and  specify it to the Supervisory Body for approval.  7 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 4.7. Addressing elements of paragraph 33 and paragraph 36 of the RMP 43. Mechanism methodologies shall address consistency of implementation of paragraph 36  of the RMP with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP through the appropriate  application of:  (a) Downward adjustment to the baseline as per paragraph 36 (iii) of the RMP; and/or  (b) Downward adjustment to the baseline resulting from or applied to the approaches  in paragraph 36 (i) and (ii) of the RMP, unless otherwise decided by the  Supervisory Body. 44. If the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above demonstrates a downward adjustment  that is greater than the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, no further  adjustment is required. Where the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above is less than  the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, further adjustment is required  to align with the result of paragraphs 45 to 47 below to ensure consistency with the  requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP. 45. Factors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment of baselines shall be included  in the project design document and updated at each renewal of the crediting period, in  accordance with paragraphs 46 to 47 below. Host Parties may decide to apply more  stringent factors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment, according to their  circumstances. 46. The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers economic  viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization  technologies, negative emission approaches while ensuring that methodologies are  aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. 47. The downward adjustment to the baseline referred to above may be operationalized  through:  (a) Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies approved  by the Supervisory Body. These may be developed by all participants covered in  decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 35. Activity participants or stakeholders may propose  factors or quantitative methods for the consideration of the Supervisory Body in  consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being involved. If  a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the procedures  for the standardized baselines shall be applied;  (b) Development of factors or quantitative methods, jointly by the Supervisory Body  and the host Party, with the provision for the host Party to make a request to the  Supervisory Body to initiate the development of the factors or quantitative methods.  The procedures for the standardized baselines may be used for this purpose; or  (c) Development of factors or quantitative methods by the host Party that are specified  to the Supervisory Body for approval. The procedures for the standardized  baselines may be used for this purpose. 4.8. Encouraging broad participation 48. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) encourage  broad participation (…)”.  8 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 49. The Supervisory Body shall encourage development of methodologies covering a wide  range of emission reduction and removal activities with broad sectoral and geographic  coverage. 50. The Supervisory Body shall encourage participation of a broad range of stakeholders  during the methodology development process and the methodology application by  enabling informed consultation as described in the “Procedure: Development, revision and  clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. 51. Mechanism methodologies shall:  (a) Contain provisions that uphold stringency and encourage broad participation by  being accurate, simple, clear, and avoiding complexity such that a wide range of  activity participants and host Parties can apply the methodology requirements  irrespective of a Party’s scientific infrastructure, financial and national  circumstances;  (b) Contain provisions that take into account the context on the ground in host Parties,  particularly in least developed countries and small island developing States;  (c) Contain provisions that take into account the knowledge and practices of local  communities and Indigenous Peoples;  (d) Permit the use of multiple data sources to address data gaps, and the use of  conservative default values and/or use of benchmarked data from comparable  regions to the extent they can be applicable;  (e) Use simple language that is inclusive, gender-sensitive, and accessible to a wide  range of stakeholders, including local communities and Indigenous Peoples to the  extent possible. 4.9. Including data sources, accounting for uncertainty and monitoring  requirements 52. Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall include relevant  assumptions, parameters, data sources and key factors (…)”. 53. The Supervisory Body shall ensure that mechanism methodologies are transparent and  comprehensible with respect to included assumptions, parameters, data sources and key  factors. 54. Mechanism methodologies shall contain or reference provisions that require the  accounting of uncertainty associated with emission factors, activity data and other  estimation parameters applied in the calculation of emission reductions or removals  consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. 55. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions requiring a listing of data parameters  that need to be monitored throughout the crediting period. This may include the data that  are directly measured where necessary on a sample basis, and the data that are collected  from other sources such as official statistics, expert judgment, IPCC guidelines, and  scientific literature. In this regard, methodologies shall contain provisions on monitoring  plans related to the collection, open publication and storing of all relevant data needed to  estimate baseline, project and leakage emissions, including provisions related to quality  assurance and quality control.  9 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 4.10. Recognizing suppressed demand 56. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) recognize  suppressed demand (…)”. 57. Suppressed demand in the context of an Article 6.4 activity is a situation where services  provided to a population are insufficient to meet the basic human needs such as minimum  amount of electricity for lighting, heating or cooling due to barriers, including low income  or lack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting such  needs requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline scenarios. 58. The Supervisory Body will recognize suppressed demand under a situation where the  BAU cannot realistically provide the level of service required of the Article 6.4 activity by  considering that the baseline scenario is not set based on the historical and continuation  of the current condition, but rather based on an alternative that provides a level of service  comparable to that provided by the Article 6.4 activity. 59. The Supervisory Body shall recognize suppressed demand by including benchmarks and  default factors in specific methodologies that may not be below BAU. 4.11. Taking into account policies and measures and relevant circumstances 60. Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) take into  account (…) policies and measures, and relevant circumstances, including national,  regional or local, social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances (…)”. 61. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to take into account relevant  circumstances, including national, regional, or local, social, economic, environmental and  technological, based on robust data and verifiable information. In this regard, the type of  data and information that would be necessary to meet the above provisions shall be  specified in the methodologies, particularly with regard to eligibility conditions, setting the  baseline, and demonstrating additionality. 4.12. Standardized baselines 62. Paragraph 37 of the RMP states that “Standardized baselines may be developed by the  Supervisory Body at the request of the host Party or may be developed by the host Party  and approved by the Supervisory Body. Standardized baselines shall be established at  the highest possible level of aggregation in the relevant sector of the host Party and be  consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP.” 63. A standardized baseline is a baseline developed at the request of or by a host Party or a  group of host Parties on a subnational, national, or group-of-Parties basis rather than on  an activity basis to facilitate the determination of the baseline, calculation of the GHG  emission reductions or removals and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4  activities, while ensuring environmental integrity within the scope of the standardized  baseline. 64. The application of standardized baselines is not mandatory unless explicitly stated in an  approved standardized baseline or in another standard approved by the Supervisory  Body. When the application of a standardized baseline is not mandatory, activity  participants may establish additionality or baseline emissions for their activity using other  approved approaches as an alternative to applying a standardized baseline.  10 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 65. A host Party may specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory  requirement for the activities implemented in the host Party. The Supervisory Body may  also specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory requirement for  certain cases such as when the standardized baseline is being used to address leakage  emissions of an activity, as further detailed in section 6 below. The provisions in this  paragraph may also apply to standardized baselines developed by or for a group of host  Parties. 66. The approaches for setting the baselines referred to in section 4.6 above shall also be  applied for the development of standardized baselines. 67. The host Party and the Supervisory Body should determine the level of aggregation taking  into account the following:  (a) A default level of aggregation shall comprise the facilities or equipment producing  a similar type of output within the geographical boundaries of one Party or a  specific subregion determined by the Party. The level of aggregation may be  expanded to a group of Parties with similar circumstances relating to the output;  (b) A default group of facilities should be disaggregated when significant dissimilarities  exist in the performance of facilities or groups of facilities in the country/region. In  this case, the disaggregation shall be carried out according to relevant criteria,  such as scale of production, installed capacity or age of the facilities. Standardized  baseline values should be determined for each group of similar facilities in this  case;  (a) Disaggregation should not result in standardized baselines with overlapping  applicability. 68. Standardized baselines shall include a default validity period of three years, starting from  the date of approval by the Supervisory Body. A host Party may propose a shorter or  longer validity period, taking into account the specificity of sectors in which activities are  undertaken, and by providing justification for the consideration of the Supervisory Body. 69. After the validity of a standardized baseline has expired, the updated standardized  baseline can be submitted by the host Party for the consideration of the Supervisory Body  for approval. An updated standardized baseline shall not impact registered activities  applying the previous version up to the end of their current crediting period. 70. Standardized baselines may be developed by the host Party and approved by the  Supervisory Body following an assessment against the “Procedure: Development,  revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. 5. Additionality demonstration 71. Paragraph 38 of the RMP states that “Each mechanism methodology shall specify the  approach to demonstrating the additionality of the activity. Additionality shall be  demonstrated using a robust assessment that shows the activity would not have occurred  in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism, taking into account all relevant  national policies, including legislation, and representing mitigation that exceeds any  mitigation that is required by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that  avoids locking in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices  incompatible with paragraph 33 of the RMP”.  11 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1 72. Paragraph 39 of the RMP states that “The Supervisory Body may apply simplified  approaches for demonstration of additionality for any least developed country or small  island developing State at the request of that Party, in accordance with requirements  developed by the Supervisory Body”. 73. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to demonstrate additionality through;  prior consideration of the benefits of the mechanism, regulatory analysis, the avoidance  of lock-in as well as through financial additionality complemented with a common practice  analysis. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in  paragraph 77 below. 74. Demonstration of the consideration of the benefits from the Article 6.4 mechanism as  necessary in the decision to implement the activity shall be performed in accordance with  the Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects. 75. Regulatory analysis shall require demonstration that the proposed activity represents  mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or regulation unless the law  or regulation refers to or formally integrates the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity that may require a  certain technological, performance or management action shall be considered, noting that  regulatory environments vary. 76. Avoidance of lock-in shall require demonstration that the proposed activity avoids locking  in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with  paragraph 33 of the RMP, including through an assessment of the scale, lifetime, and  emissions intensity of the activity; 77. Financial additionality can be proved either by:  (a) Demonstration that the proposed activity would not have occurred in the absence  of the incentives from the mechanism through an investment analysis (default  approach); or  (b) Assessment of barriers to the implementation of the activity, such as financial and  institutional barriers, first of its kind, taking into account all relevant national  policies, including legislation and current practices within the activity sector and  geographic area including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws.  To demonstrate additionality for their activity, through barrier analysis, activity  participants shall:  (i) Describe the barriers, including the reasons why investment analysis is not  sufficient; and  (ii) Evidence the barriers and how the mechanism will help overcome the  barriers.  (c) A common practice analysis to complement the investment and barrier analysis by  demonstrating that the measure or technology is not already widespread through  an analysis of the extent to which the proposed project type (e.g. technology or  practice) has already diffused in the relevant sector and region. 78. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in paragraph  77 above, subject to applicability conditions. The use of such approaches by an activity  shall require demonstration of the following, inter alia:  (a) the use of baseline approach(es) in paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) of the RMPs;  12 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1  (b) that the technologies or practices applied in the activity outperform an ambitious  threshold for emissions or emissions reductions, market penetration, or other  unique characteristics, set at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the  RMPs. 79. When formulating an approach to demonstrate the additionality, the Supervisory Body  shall take into account any communication from the host Party regarding paragraph 80  below. 80. When formulating an approach to the demonstration of additionality, including for  paragraph 76 above, mechanism methodologies should consider the relevant  circumstances, including national, regional or local, social, economic, environmental and  technological circumstances, in line with paragraphs 60 and 61 above, including Party-led  identification of activities that may be transformative. 6. Leakage 81. Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) avoid leakage,  where applicable (…)”. 82. Leakage refers to anthropogenic emissions by sources of GHGs that occur outside the  activity boundary which are attributable to the Article 6.4 activity. 83. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to:  (a) Ensure that the potential sources of leakage in activities covered by a mechanism  methodology are identified, including, but not limited to, any sources referred to in  paragraph 84 below;  (b) Require activities to avoid or minimize all sources of leakage by applying the  appropriate approach(es) referred to in paragraph 85 below, including addressing  any remaining leakage by discounting credited volumes as described in paragraph  85(a) below;  (c) Require that activity participants list all potential sources of leakage that may  reasonably be attributable to the activity and describe how each is being  addressed. If the activity participant excludes any source of leakage from  consideration, they shall justify its exclusion;  (d) Include provisions for robust, transparent and user-friendly measurement,  reporting and independent third-party verification systems that encompass specific  sources of potential leakage identified;  (e) Include, where necessary, life cycle analysis of products or material in relation to  the source indicated in paragraph 84(d) below;  (f) Require the activity participant to take into account relevant information from the  DNA of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of  the tool developed by the Supervisory Body. 84. Leakage may occur due to, inter alia:  (a) Continued use of baseline equipment being transferred beyond the activity  boundary;  13 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1  (b) Use of resources that have competing uses from activities outside the activity  boundary that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary or shifts of  pre-project activities that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary;  (c) Diversion of existing production processes or services accounted for in the  baseline, inter alia through relocation and continuation of baseline activities outside  the activity boundary;  (d) Impacts on upstream and downstream processes associated with the materials  and services used by the activity, and/or products or services provided by the  activity, relative to the baseline, unless they are accounted as activity emissions. 85. Leakage shall be avoided and, where not possible, minimized, or addressed, by, inter alia:  (a) Discounting credited volumes: deducting emission reductions from credited  volumes taking into account equipment lifetime, where applicable;  (b) Scrapping of baseline equipment: undertaking and evidencing the  destruction/decommissioning/disposal of baseline equipment;  (c) Application of higher-level elements: applying a standardized baseline at a  higher level of aggregation (or equivalent) that is regularly updated and any  associated higher-level monitoring information and/or system;  (d) Nesting: Aligning relevant aspects of activity design and implementing activities  together with an existing higher-level crediting programme;  (e) Upscaling implementation: implementing activities at a higher level (e.g.  sectoral, subnational, or national). 86. For some types of activities, monitoring and use of a standardized baseline (or equivalent)  at national scale or jurisdictional level is necessary to quantify and account for leakage. 87. For those activities falling under the scope of Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Paris  Agreement, mechanism methodologies shall require, in addition to all relevant  requirements adopted by the Supervisory Body3, demonstration that the activity is included  in all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, noting  this is consistent with the application of the approaches described in paragraph 85 (c) and  (e). 7. Non-permanence and reversals 88. Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) address  reversals, where applicable”. 89. Mechanism methodologies shall address reversals of removals and emission reductions  using an approach consistent with the standard on requirements for activities involving  removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism.  ----- 3  See also document Article 6.4 activity standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-002) available at  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf.  14 of 15  A6.4-STAN-METH-001 Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies Version 01.1  Document information Version Date Description 01.1 26 February 2025 Editorial revision to correct formatting and a cross reference in  paragraph 80. 01.0 9 October 2024 SBM 014, Annex 5.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), by its decision 3/CMA.3 “Rules, modalities and procedures for the  mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”, paragraph  6(c), requested the Supervisory Body of the mechanism established by Article 6,  paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to elaborate and further  develop, on the basis of the rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism  (RMP), recommendations on activities involving removals, including appropriate  monitoring, reporting, accounting for removals and crediting periods, addressing  reversals, avoidance of leakage, and avoidance of other negative environmental and  social impacts, in addition to the activities referred to in chapter V of the RMP (Article 6,  paragraph 4, activity cycle), to be considered at its fourth session (November 2022). 1 2. In response to this request, the Supervisory Body agreed on the recommendations on  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in the annex to  the addendum of its annual report to the CMA at its fourth session2. 3. The CMA, by its decision 7/CMA.4, paragraphs 19 and 20, invited Parties and admitted  observer organizations to submit, via the submission portal, by 15 March 2023, their views  on activities involving removals and requested the Supervisory Body to consider the views  of Parties and observers in elaborating and further developing recommendations on  activities involving removals, while taking into account the mandate provided to the  Supervisory Body contained in paragraph 24(a)(ix) of the RMP, and considering broader  inputs from stakeholders provided in a structured public consultation process. 4. Based on the request of the CMA in its decisions 3/CMA.3 and 7/CMA.4 and considering  views of Parties and observers as well as inputs from stakeholders, the Supervisory Body  agreed on the updated recommendation to the CMA as contained in the addendum of its  annual report to the CMA at its fifth session.3 5. The CMA, at its fifth session, requested the Supervisory Body to continue the relevant  work to operationalize the mechanism with a view to elaborating and further developing  recommendations for consideration and adoption at CMA 6. 1  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/460950. 2  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/621980. 3  Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/632332.  3 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 1.2. Objectives 6. The objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for activities involving removals  under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. Entry into force 7. This version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024. 3. Context of removals under this standard 3.1. Context 8. Relevant extracts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth  Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (WGIII) definitions of activities involving  removals include the following:  (a) Anthropogenic removals as the withdrawal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the  atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. (IPCC AR6 WGIII report,  glossary);  (b) Carbon dioxide removal (CO2; CDR) as anthropogenic activities removing CO2  from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean  reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic  enhancement of biological, geochemical or chemical CO2 sinks, but excludes  natural CO2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. (IPCC AR-6 WG III  report, technical summary). 3.2. Definitions 9. For this document,  (a) Removals are the outcomes of processes by which greenhouse gases are  removed from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities and are  either destroyed or durably stored through anthropogenic activities;  (b) Activities involving removals meet the requirements referred to in paragraph 10.  Any examples in this standard relating to specific activity types or categories are  for illustrative purposes only and do not have the force of decisions by the  Supervisory Body regarding their use under the Article 6.4 mechanism, unless  explicitly so stated;  (c) Removals eligible for crediting are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for  removals;  (d) Reversals are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for removals;  (e) Avoidable reversals are reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have influence or control;  (f) Unavoidable reversals are reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have no influence or control.  4 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 4. Requirements 10. Activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the  Article 6.4 mechanism shall meet the requirements contained in the following sections, all  the applicable standards and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism and any further  requirements approved by the Supervisory Body in this regard. 4.1. Monitoring 11. Activity participants shall4 ensure that monitoring of removals is carried out based on data  derived from measurements, sampling, remote sensing, third party sources and published  literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and take appropriate  account of the associated uncertainties. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that specify the monitoring approaches  for all parameters necessary to calculate removals according to the types of removal  activities. 13. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the net removals are calculated in a  conservative manner, taking due account of the associated uncertainties. 14. To allow for flexibility in monitoring, default values may be used in the calculation of  removals provided that the use of the default values results in a conservative estimate of  net removals, taking due account of the associated uncertainties. 15. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for appropriate quality assurance and  quality control measures, such as cross-checking of monitoring results with other data  sources and published literature, or calibration of measuring equipment at regular  intervals. 16. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for monitoring and mitigating any risks  identified in section 4.6.1 Reversal risk assessment, and any risks identified in the  Sustainable development tool of the Article 6.4 mechanism, including through the free,  prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples directly or indirectly affected by the  activity. 17. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions requiring the activity participants to  submit a monitoring plan as part of the project design document submitted with the request  for registration. The monitoring plan shall be reviewed and updated at the beginning of  each renewed crediting period and in any of the following circumstances:  (a) The designated operational entity (DOE) or the Supervisory Body identifies the  need to revise the monitoring plan based on any concerns identified with the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;  (b) Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are  not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan; 4  For normative references, refer to section Normative reference of the Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies.  5 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  (c) The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk  factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring  plan and the risk assessment plan. 4.2. Reporting 18. Activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report after implementing the monitoring  activities specified in the monitoring plan. 19. Monitoring reports shall be based on the monitoring plan contained in the registered  activity design document and shall include:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated net removals occurring during the monitoring period, together with  the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;  (d) Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could  have led to the reversal of removals along with a summary of the GHG release  notifications referred to in paragraph 43 that were submitted during the period  covered by the monitoring report;  (e) Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent  with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered project design  document;  (f) Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been  assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the  registered project design document. 20. Monitoring reports shall be prepared without a gap between the two consecutive  monitoring periods, which may be of equal or different duration. 21. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the frequency of submission of the monitoring  reports, based on the nature, the type and the risk of reversals associated with the activity  involving removals identified through the application of necessary standards and tools.  The specified frequency shall include the following elements:  (a) The maximum permissible interval between the start date of the first crediting  period and the submission of the first monitoring report shall be between one and  five years;  (b) The maximum permissible interval between the submission of two consecutive  monitoring reports after the first monitoring report shall be between one and five  years. 22. The activity participants may choose a shorter time period than the time period specified  in paragraph 21. 23. In addition to the monitoring reports referred to in paragraph 21, a monitoring report shall  also be submitted following the observation of an event of GHG release that could  potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in paragraph 47.  6 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 24. The activity participants may request the Supervisory Body, providing a transparent and  verifiable justification, to extend the due date for submission of a monitoring report beyond  the due date determined in accordance with paragraphs 21 to 23. The Supervisory Body  shall consider the request for the extension of the due date and shall either grant or refuse  such an extension. 25. If the activity participants fail to submit a monitoring report by the due date determined in  accordance with paragraphs 21 to 24, the operations of issuance, transfer, and  cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity for which the monitoring report was due  shall be suspended, and there may be other consequences as determined by the  Supervisory Body in its guidance on and procedures for addressing late, incomplete, or  missing monitoring report submissions. 4.3. Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting 26. Monitoring shall continue after the end of the last active crediting period of the activity to  assess whether any reversals have occurred, quantify the amount of reversals and confirm  the continued storage of the GHGs. 27. No A6.4ERs shall be issued for the net removals occurring during the post-crediting  monitoring period. 28. The activity participants may request the Supervisory Body to allow termination of the  post-crediting monitoring if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable  information, that:  (a) The stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or  (b) The potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of  section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals. 4.4. Accounting for removals 29. Accounting for removals shall be undertaken in a consistent unit of measurement. 30. Removals eligible for crediting shall be determined as follows:  (a) The net change in greenhouse gas storage shall be calculated by subtracting the  sum of the change in greenhouse gas stored in each applicable greenhouse gas  reservoir in the baseline scenario from the sum of the change in greenhouse gas  stored in each applicable greenhouse gas reservoir in the activity scenario,  calculated from the start date of the period covered by a monitoring report to the  end date of the same period;  (b) The net change in emissions, not including any greenhouse gas storage losses  from the greenhouse gas reservoirs referred to in paragraph (a), shall be calculated  by subtracting the total emissions in the baseline scenario from the total emissions in the  activity scenario, calculated from the start date of the period covered by a  monitoring report to the end date of the same period;  (c) If the net change in greenhouse gas storage is positive, then the number of  A6.4ERs issued to the activity is calculated by combining the following terms  (herein referred to as net removals):  (i) The net change in greenhouse gas storage, specified in paragraph (a);  7 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  (ii) Minus (-) the net change in emissions, specified in paragraph (b);  (iii) Minus (-) any applicable leakage effects;  (iv) Minus (-) any crediting deficit, specified in paragraph (d);  (d) If the calculation in paragraph (c) is negative, then no A6.4ERs shall be issued for  the period covered by that monitoring report and the negative number shall be  recorded as a crediting deficit and included in future A6.4ER issuance calculations;  (e) If the net change in greenhouse gas storage is negative, then there is a reversal  of an equivalent quantity (herein referred to as reversals). 31. Only the positive net changes in GHG storage referred to in paragraph 30 that are directly  anthropogenic shall be eligible for crediting. 32. A carbon pool, a GHG reservoir or a greenhouse gas may be optionally excluded from  accounting if it is demonstrated, through transparent and verifiable information, that such  exclusion results in a more conservative calculation of the net removals. 33. The calculation referred to in paragraph 30 shall be carried out for each year of the post-  crediting monitoring period. 34. Where an activity involving removals also results in emission reductions, the accounting  of removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the monitoring report in  accordance with the methodology applicable to the activity. 4.5. Methodologies applicable for a renewed crediting period 35. At the renewal of the crediting period, the activity participants shall apply the latest version  of the applicable methodology. 4.6. Addressing reversals 36. The activity participants shall prevent and minimize the risk of reversals. The reversal of  removals in respect of which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated in  accordance with the provisions of section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals. 4.6.1. Reversal risk assessment 37. The risks of reversals may be related to, inter alia:  (a) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, rising opportunity costs;  (b) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,  acts of terrorism, crime, and war;  (c) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, and droughts,  hurricanes, floods, and landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, geological  faults, and fractures;  (d) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. 38. Activity participants shall conduct a risk assessment, which shall include a risk mitigation  plan, for an activity involving removals, using the reversal risk assessment tool to identify,  assess and mitigate reversal risks, and calculate an overall percentage-based risk rating  8 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  (hereinafter referred to as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable  reversals, taking into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood, and duration of  the risks. 39. The percentage-based risk rating calculated in paragraph 38 above shall inform:  (a) The proportion of A6.4ERs to be transferred to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account;  (b) Identification of A6.4ERs with a negligible risk of reversal which shall be tagged in  the mechanism registry. 40. The risk assessment and the related information referred to in paragraphs 37 and 38  above shall form part of the project design document submitted with the request for  registration. 41. Activity participants shall review and revise the risk assessment every five years from the  start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances referred to in  paragraph 17. 42. The risk assessment and related reporting shall in addition to the above follow any further  guidance to be developed on risk rating and any upper limits to the risk rating. 4.6.2. Reversal-related notifications and actions 43. The activity participants shall notify the Supervisory Body of any observed event involving  the release of stored GHGs that could potentially lead to a reversal (hereinafter referred  to as “the observed event”) within 30 days of becoming aware of the event. The  notification, which may be in digital form, shall include a brief description of the event,  including the date or the dates of its occurrence and its location. 44. Upon the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 43, the Supervisory Body shall  instruct the mechanism registry administrator to suspend the operations of issuance,  transfer, and cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity involving removals. 45. The activity participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report, containing  information referred to in paragraphs 19(a)-(c) in order to determine whether the observed  event has resulted in an actual reversal. If the observed event is an ongoing event, the  preliminary assessment report shall be prepared after the event has ended or has been  fully contained. 46. If the preliminary assessment report referred to in paragraph 45 concludes, on the basis  of transparent and verifiable evidence, that the observed event did not result in an actual  reversal, the report shall be verified by the DOE and submitted to the Supervisory Body  within 90 days of the end of the observed event. If the Supervisory Body approves the  preliminary assessment report, it shall notify the activity participants of such approval and  shall instruct the mechanism registry administrator to resume the suspended registry  operations referred to in paragraph 44. 47. If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the  preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual  reversal, the activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report in accordance with  9 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0  paragraph 19 and, after its verification by the DOE, shall submit the monitoring report to  the Supervisory Body within 365 days of the end of the observed event. 48. Upon receipt of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the Supervisory Body  shall assess the monitoring report and determine whether the report accurately estimates  the magnitude of the reversal and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable,  and, based on that determination, proceed to take the actions described in section 4.6.3  Remediation of reversals. 49. Following the submission of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the activity  participants shall review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk  rating of the activity as necessary. This shall result in increased contribution to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account if there is an increase in the risk rating and require the  development of plans to prevent further releases of GHGs. 50. The activity participants shall also review the compliance with the requirements and  safeguards contained in the Sustainable development tool, taking into account any  negative environmental and social impacts caused by the reversal and developing plans  to prevent the recurrence of such negative environmental and social impacts. 51. The activity participants shall remain responsible for the implementation of the activity,  including carrying out the processes, actions and measures required by this section. 4.6.3. Remediation of reversals 52. Reversals of removals for which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated by  taking measures described in this section and any other further relevant guidance from  the Supervisory Body. The measures are intended to effectively address reversals and  maintain incentives for activity participants to proactively mitigate reversal risks and avoid  reversals. 4.6.3.1. Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account operations and contributions 53. The Supervisory Body shall establish a Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account in the  mechanism registry which serves to remediate avoidable and unavoidable reversals in full  through cancellation of an equivalent amount and authorization status (authorized A6.4ER  or Mitigation Contribution Unit) of Buffer A6.4ERs. The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account  shall aggregate all contributions of Buffer A6.4ERs. 54. The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account shall be administered and shall only be accessed  by the Article 6.4 mechanism registry administrator. The composition of the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, including the share of A6.4ERs by vintage, region and country, type  of activity, authorization status, risk rating, and methodology, shall be published annually. 55. Upon issuance of all A6.4ERs, an amount of A6.4ERs proportionate to the issuing  activity’s risk rating for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals shall be forwarded to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. A6.4ERs forwarded to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account shall become Buffer A6.4ERs. Buffer A6.4ERs shall only be cancelled and shall  not be further transferred. 56. Following a reversal event and the Supervisory Body’s review of a full monitoring report  that reflects reversals, the Supervisory Body will immediately notify the mechanism  registry administrator of the results of its review and the amount and type of Buffer  A6.4ERs required for remediation.  10 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 57. The mechanism registry administrator shall immediately notify the activity participants,  effect the cancellation of Buffer A6.4ERs equal to the amount of reversals, and shall  indicate the purpose of cancellation for remediation of reversals in the mechanism registry. 58. For avoidable reversals, for which A6.4ERs have been cancelled from the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, activity participants shall be fully liable for replenishing the Reversal  Risk Buffer Pool Account by forwarding the equivalent amount and type (authorized  A6.4ER or Mitigation Contribution Unit) of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account within a timeframe to be specified by the Supervisory Body. 59. Activity participants should obtain and maintain sufficient coverage under an insurance  policy or comparable guarantee products to cover the risk that avoidable reversals occur. 60. The Supervisory Body shall oversee a regular stress-test of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account to assess the resilience of the pool to a range of reversal risk scenarios and to  consider and implement any potential remedial actions necessary to manage risks to the  robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. 61. The stress-test shall assess the resilience of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account to a  range of reversal risk scenarios based on, inter alia, the range of risk ratings as well as  significant loss event(s), affecting the activities linked to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account. The stress-test shall occur at least every three years and in an event of a  significant loss event. 62. The Supervisory Body will consider and implement any potential remedial actions  necessary to manage risks to the robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account,  including ongoing consideration of measures to remediate reversals and ensure the  resilience, sufficiency, and solvency of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, and other  appropriate measures and procedures that may provide suitable alternative means to  remediate reversals, including the following:  (a) Requirements and approval procedures for the use of insurance policies, or  comparable guarantee products, or third-party guarantee approved by the  Supervisory Body to cover the risk that reversals occur;  (b) Procedures for establishing, managing, and using a monetary permanence reserve  enabling remediation of reversals through the direct or potentially centralized  purchase and cancellation of A6.4ERs with negligible or no reversal risk. 4.6.3.2. Avoidable versus unavoidable reversals 63. Mechanism methodologies shall, in addition to the above, follow further guidance  developed by the Supervisory Body on avoidable and unavoidable reversals. 4.7. Avoidance of leakage 64. The activity participants shall address the risk of leakage and account for any residual  leakage in calculation of net removals in accordance with the requirements set out in  “Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the  development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”, The  methodologies and associated tools may include additional requirements for specific types  of removal activities.  11 of 12  A6.4-STAN-METH-002 Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 01.0 4.8. Avoidance of other negative environmental and social impacts and  respecting human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples 65. The activity participants shall apply robust social and environmental safeguards to  minimize and, where possible, avoid negative environmental and social impacts of the  activity in accordance with the requirements contained in:  (a) Article 6.4 sustainable development tool5;  (b) Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard6;  (c) Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for projects 7 , including the  provisions for local and global stakeholder consultation contained therein;  (d) Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism8;  (e) Any other relevant provisions developed by the Supervisory Body in this regard.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 9 October 2024 SBM 014, Annex 6.

Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This standard sets out requirements for mechanism methodologies for setting the crediting  baseline, including identifying the baseline scenario and determining baseline emissions  and/or removals, and provides requirements for the determination of standardized  baselines. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies in developing  methodologies and by the Secretariat, the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) and the  Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism methodologies for approval.  The standard is not intended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or  monitoring reports. 2. Additional requirements for mechanism methodologies beyond setting the baseline are  included in Appendix 1 to this document. 1.2. Entry into force 3. This document enters into force on 16 May 2025. 2. Definitions 4. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Activity participant: A public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4  activity;  (b) Applicability conditions: Conditions that specify contexts, configurations and  cases in which a mechanism methodology can be applied to a proposed Article 6.4  activity while ensuring environmental integrity;  (c) Baseline geographical reference area: The geographical area assessed for  setting the crediting baseline;  (d) Best available technology (BAT): The practice or technology in a given scope  (e.g. sector and baseline geographical area) that:  i. Provides a similar output as the Article 6.4 activity;  ii. Represents an economically feasible and environmentally sound course of  action;  iii. Is available in the baseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the  shelf, or via a tendering or direct contracting process, or by direct  implementation by an end user within the boundary of potential Article 6.4  activities; and  iv. Results in the lowest emissions or largest removals per unit of output  among all practices and/or technologies that fulfil the conditions (i) to (iii).  4 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (e) Best performing comparable activities: The activities that provide outputs within  a top segment of performance in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or  removals per unit of output, considering all activities that provide similar outputs in  a baseline geographical reference area;  (f) Business-as-usual (BAU): Plausible reference benchmark or scenario for GHG  emissions or removals prior to or in the absence of the implementation of the  proposed Article 6.4 activity. It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an  emissions or removals intensity;  (g) Crediting baseline: Reference emissions or removals level against which the  volume of emission reductions or net removals achieved by the Article 6.4 activity  is quantified;  (h) Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent  agreements, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding  mandates, noting that regulatory environments may vary;  (i) Level of aggregation: The extent to which consolidation of information from any  parts or units to form a collective whole is undertaken;  (j) Level of service: the quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an  Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;  (k) Output: Each good or service1 provided by the Article 6.4 activity and/or in the  baseline scenario, as specified in the mechanism methodology;  (l) Policies: All national or sub-national policies that are applicable to the relevant  activity and its alternatives, including: policies and legal requirements; subsidies  and incentives (e.g., incentives from carbon pricing schemes such as emission  trading schemes or from guarantees of origin); taxes and tax breaks; fees;  performance standards; or other specified instruments or means of  implementation. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national targets  for the sector or the type of activity, as long as these are supported by policy  frameworks for implementation, but not general goals (e.g., a national emissions  target) that are not specific to the sector or type of activity;  (m) Pool of users: For activities related to outputs, the pool of users consists of the  user(s) supplied with the outputs by the activity;  (n) Remaining lifetime: The period during which an equipment would continue  operating and/or a certain practice would remain in place without undergoing major  repair or overhaul as specified in the mechanism methodology, given limitations  such as technical lifetime, economic lifetime, legal requirements, policies, or any  other factor which would lead to the discontinuation of the use of the equipment  and/or practice;  (o) Sector: A segment of a national economy that delivers defined output(s) (e.g.  municipal waste management, household cooking energy, electricity, residential  cooling, freight transportation); 1 For example, electricity, cooking energy, municipal waste management, and so forth.  5 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (p) Standardized baseline: A standardization developed on a subnational, national,  or group-of-Parties basis rather than on activity-specific basis to facilitate the  determination of the baseline, calculation of GHG emission reductions or removals  and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 activities, while ensuring  environmental integrity within the scope of the standardized baseline.2 3. Applicability 5. This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for  activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to  also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes  of activities, policies, sectoral approaches, etc). The standard further applies for the  development of standardized baselines. 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions  and net removals. The standard may be amended in the future to incorporate further  considerations for activities involving removals. 7. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For  simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard. 4. General principles and requirements 4.1. Principles 8. The following principles shall be applied in setting crediting baselines and standardized  baselines to ensure that information provided is a true and fair account. These principles  shall be the basis for and guide the development of mechanism methodologies and  standardized baselines:  (a) Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative  information shall be reduced as far as is practical;  (b) Below business as usual: The determined crediting baseline shall be below a  conservatively determined BAU emissions level;  (c) Completeness: All relevant information to support the baseline setting shall be  included;  (d) Conservativeness: In the context of baseline setting, conservativeness is the use  of data, parameters, assumptions, and methods to ensure that baseline emissions  are not overestimated, and baseline removals are not underestimated. Only  credible sources shall be used that are appropriate to the context of the type of  activity;  (e) Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across  similar circumstances; 2 Based on the definition provided in A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 63. Available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf  6 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (f) Encourage ambition over time: Crediting baselines shall decrease over time to  encourage ambition of activities;  (g) Real: The results of activities represent actual tonnes of GHG emission reductions  or net removals derived from credible methods for estimating mitigation outcomes;  (h) Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for setting the  crediting baseline shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters  that may have an impact on the outcome of setting the crediting baseline shall be  included;  (i) Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow  intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency  relates to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied;  referencing background material; stating documentation changes and stating and  justifying all data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the  outcomes can be reproduced. 4.2. General requirements 4.2.1. General requirements for quantification 9. Mechanism methodologies shall satisfy the general requirements for mechanism  methodologies included in Appendix 1 of this standard. 4.2.2. Description of the pre-activity scenario 10. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to describe the pre-activity  scenario in the PDD. The pre-activity scenario corresponds to the circumstances  immediately prior to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and shall be the existing  conditions at the site where the activity will be implemented; or the conditions in the  absence of policies that refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation or, for the case of distributed technologies for households, communities,  and/or small and medium enterprises, the existing conditions for providing the activity  output(s) in the baseline geographical reference area. 4.2.3. Data requirements for baseline setting and quantification 11. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the assumptions, parameters, data sources and  key factors used for determining the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline emissions  and/or removals and specify the related requirements with regard to data quality, vintage,  availability and credibility. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall require data to be sourced from the most appropriate  data source. This may include internal data of the activity participants or publicly available  information provided by third parties. Only credible sources shall be used that are  appropriate to the context of the type of activity. Relevant third-party data sources may  include IPCC publications, peer-reviewed scientific literature, test results following  accepted standards performed by accredited entities, reports/statistics published by  governments, multilateral entities, or industry or sector organizations, as applicable. 13. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants and developers of  standardized baselines to transparently list and describe the sources of data considered  7 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  and justify the vintage, relevance, accuracy, and conservativeness of the choices made.  The data used shall be referenced. In cases where values, approaches or data sources  are only applicable to specific scopes (e.g., geographic or sectoral scopes), the  mechanism methodologies or standardized baselines shall clearly describe the scope of  applicability of the respective values, approaches or data sources. 14. Mechanism methodologies shall determine the baseline scenario and the baseline  emissions and/or removals in a transparent manner. They shall also take into account the  uncertainty associated with setting the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline  emissions and/or removals, consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. The consideration  of uncertainty shall include all causes of uncertainty, including assumptions, equations or  models, parameters and measurements. The consideration of uncertainty may, however,  focus or be limited to those causes of uncertainty that are most relevant in the context of  the Article 6.4 activity (e.g., the uncertainty of minor baseline emission sources may not  need to be considered). In the process of quantification of uncertainties, expert judgment  may be used, among other approaches provided by relevant IPCC guidelines. 15. Different approaches may be pursued to address uncertainty. These may include  approaches that address overall uncertainty or approaches that address uncertainty  separately for the baseline scenario and the quantification of baseline emissions and/or  removals. For example, in the case of uncertainties in the selection of the baseline  scenario, the most conservative scenario may be selected among different plausible  scenarios; whereas, for determining the baseline emissions and/or removals the  uncertainty may be quantified using approaches such as formulas for error propagation. 4.2.4. Standardization 16. Standardization of baseline scenarios and crediting baselines in mechanism  methodologies is encouraged as this avoids the risk of selection bias in using project-  specific approaches, which could lead to overestimation of baseline emissions or  underestimation of baseline removals. Such standardization may be achieved by the  application of the BAT or ambitious benchmark approach to baseline setting or through  the use of default values. 4.2.5. Justification of methodological choices and assumptions 17. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify all methodological choices and  assumptions made in determining the baseline scenario and the crediting baseline,  including how the choices and assumptions ensure that the principles and requirements  in this section and the requirements in Appendix 1 are satisfied. 5. Approach to setting the crediting baseline 5.1. Summary of the step-wise approach to determining the crediting baseline 18. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the procedure for determining the crediting  baseline, in accordance with the step-wise approach in figure 1 and described below.  8 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 Figure 1. Procedure for determining the crediting baseline3  Step 1. Select one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36  of the RMPs and justify the choice (Section 5)  Step 2. Apply the selected approach (Section 6), prior to implementation of  a downward adjustment, including:  • Determination of the baseline scenario  • Quantification of the unadjusted baseline emissions and/or removals  Step 3. Apply the downward adjustment, unless exemptions apply  (Section 7), including  • Quantification of the downward adjustment  • Quantification of the resulting downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or  removals  Step 4. Identify a conservative BAU baseline (Section 8), including  • Determination of the BAU scenario  • Quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals  Step 5. Compare the downward adjusted baseline from Step 3 and the  conservative BAU baseline from Step 4 (Section 9)  • Is the numerical value of the downward adjusted baseline lower than the  numerical value of the conservative BAU baseline?  Select the downward adjusted baseline Apply a further adjustment to ensure  as the crediting baseline that the downward adjusted baseline  is lower than the conservative BAU  baseline 3 Note that this procedure is applied both ex-ante in the project design document and ex-post in monitoring  reports. Further details on the timing and the ex-post application is included in sections 8 to 9. For ex-  post application of the procedure, in Step 5, the lower between the conservative BAU and the downward  adjusted baseline is selected as the crediting baseline for each calendar year during the crediting period,  rather than going back to Step 3.  9 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 5.1.1. Step 1: Selection of one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of the Rules,  Modalities and Procedures 19. In Step 1, mechanism methodologies shall specify which of the approaches from  paragraph 36 of the Rules, Modalities and Procedures (RMPs) is selected for determining  the crediting baseline for the Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies shall apply  one of the three approaches specified in paragraph 36 of the RMPs for setting the baseline  scenario for each of the components of the activity (e.g., for the capture of landfill gas and  its use for energy generation, one baseline approach may be applied for the capture of  landfill gas and a different baseline approach may be applied for energy generation). The  selected approach shall satisfy the applicability conditions provided for the relevant  approach in section 6 below. The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall also  consider the guidance provided in section 6 on which approaches may be best suited  under different circumstances and justify the appropriateness of the choice among  approaches (i) to (iii) of paragraph 36 of the RMP. 5.1.2. Step 2: Application of the selected baseline approach prior to downward adjustment 20. In step 2, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the selected approach, prior to any  downward adjustment, is applied to determine the baseline scenario and the baselines  emissions and/or removals occurring in the determined baseline scenario. 21. Mechanism methodologies shall define and justify, or require the activity participants to  define and justify, the baseline geographical reference area considering the main baseline  sources or sinks. The baseline geographical reference area may be global, regional,  national, sub-national or site-specific. An Article 6.4 activity type that supplies a global pool  of users with a highly internationally traded good (e.g., aluminium) may need to consider  global conditions when setting the crediting baseline. On the contrary, some Article 6.4  activity types may only affect baseline emissions within a very restricted geographical  scope or even at a specific site4. 22. To determine the baseline scenario, the mechanism methodology shall either:  (a) Specify and justify the baseline scenario; or  (b) Include a stepwise procedure for how activity participants or host countries shall  determine the baseline scenario. 23. The procedure and methodological approaches for paragraph 22 shall follow the  requirements set out in section 6 of this standard. 24. Mechanism methodologies may either use separate approaches to demonstrate  additionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both  demonstrates additionality and determines the baseline scenario, depending on the  approach selected. Specifically, it may be possible to use BAT or an ambitious benchmark  to simultaneously determine the baseline scenario and apply “performance-based  approaches” in demonstrating additionality (refer to the “Standard: Demonstration of  additionality in mechanism methodologies”). Where a combined approach is used, both 4 For example, in the case of switching to a low-emission energy source or feedstock in a specific plant,  only site-specific conditions may need to be considered when setting the crediting baseline.  10 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  this standard and the standard “Demonstration of additionality in mechanism  methodologies” shall apply. 25. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the methods for quantification of the baseline  emissions and/or removals. Mechanism methodologies shall specify to which potential  baseline scenarios its quantification methods are applicable. The methodological  approaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 6 of this standard. 26. Under all three approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs, mechanism methodologies shall  determine whether any trends in the emissions and removals, or the emissions or  removals intensity (i.e., emissions or removals per unit of output), over time should be  incorporated in the baseline quantification. Such trends may, inter alia, arise from  technological improvements over time or occur due to policies. This is necessary if such  trends have a material impact on the emissions and removals, or the emissions or removal  intensity, in the baseline scenario. Where such trends are relevant, mechanism  methodologies may reflect such trends by determining a baseline that declines over time  or by setting the baseline at a sufficiently ambitious level to address any such trends. 5.1.3. Step 3: Application of the downward adjustment 27. In step 3, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the downward adjustment shall be  determined, including the quantification of the downward adjustment and the quantification  of the resulting downward adjusted baseline. 28. Where baseline approaches from RMP paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) have been selected,  exemptions from the downward adjustment may apply in particular circumstances, subject  to the provisions in section 7.2. Where such exemptions are proposed, the proponent of  the mechanism methodology shall provide appropriate justification. 29. The procedure and methodological approaches to determine the downward adjustment  shall follow the requirements set out in section 7. 30. The downward adjusted baseline shall be determined as the baseline emissions and/or  removals determined in Step 2, reduced by the quantified downward adjustment  determined in accordance with the requirements in section 7. Note that for both emissions  and removals baselines, the downward adjustment is subtracted, noting that removals  shall be assigned a negative value and emissions a positive value. 5.1.4. Step 4: Identification of a conservative business-as-usual baseline 31. In step 4, mechanism methodologies shall specify how a conservative business-as-usual  (BAU) baseline shall be determined, including the determination of the BAU scenario and  the quantification of the emissions and/or removals occurring in the BAU scenario. The  methodological approaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 8. 5.1.5. Step 5: Comparison of the downward adjusted baseline and the conservative  business-as-usual baseline 32. In Step 5, mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to compare the  downward adjusted baseline and the conservative BAU baseline and specify the  procedure and methodological approaches to select the crediting baseline following the  requirements set out in section 9.  11 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 5.2. Application of the baseline approaches at different levels of aggregation 33. The baseline scenario or parameters to quantify crediting baseline for emissions and/or  removals, such as baseline emission factors, may be applied at different levels and by  different entities:  (a) Proponent of the mechanism methodology: The proponent of a mechanism  methodology may determine the baseline scenario or parameters to quantify  baseline emissions and/or removals, for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4  activities that are eligible under the methodology. For example, a mechanism  methodology may determine the baseline scenario as the consumption of power  from the electric grid and may accordingly provide methods to determine the grid  emission factor to quantify baseline emissions. The proponent of the mechanism  methodology shall provide documented evidence and justifications in the  methodology that the scenario and/or parameters are applicable for the relevant  activities. The mechanism methodology may then state that these matters are  deemed to be applicable for the relevant activities, as long as the applicability  criteria or conditions specified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism  methodology may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis.  The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration  of the validity of the proposed methodology (e.g., three years). Where the  application of the standardization is mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the  mechanism methodology;  (b) Activity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify  in the methodology how the baseline scenario shall be determined and/or how  baseline emissions and/or removals shall be quantified by each individual activity  applying the methodology. This procedure shall then be applied by each proposed  Article 6.4 activity. For example, a methodology may provide a method for how  each activity shall quantify existing actual or historical emissions and a downward  adjustment factor for them;  (c) Host countries: The proponents of a mechanism methodology shall specify in the  methodology which approaches, parameters or conditions may or shall be  demonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host  countries. This may include standardization in relation to baseline setting, baseline  quantification, or additionality demonstration. Standardization could also relate  only to a specific parameter, such as the grid emission factor or the fraction of non-  renewable biomass. Where the application of the standardized baseline is  mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the standardized baseline. 6. Application of baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of  the Rules, Modalities and Procedures 34. This section sets out how the approaches for setting the baseline referred to in paragraph  36 of the RMP shall be implemented in mechanism methodologies. The section  complements the requirements set out in Step 2 of section 5.  12 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 6.1. Best available technology approach 6.1.1. Applicability 35. Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where the  following applies:  (a) The emissions or removals per unit of output are determined primarily by the  technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity; and  (b) Best available technology (BAT) can be determined with the available data. 36. This approach may be particularly suitable where:  (a) An activity consists of a single technology and/or practice (e.g.,  substitution/installation of new equipment such as clean cooking activities);  and/or  (b) The activity and alternative technologies and/or practices provide reasonably  homogeneous outputs (i.e., they produce similar outputs for the pool of users). 37. If the proposed mechanism methodology falls within the scope of the sector or activity type  identified by the host party to apply BAT as default approach, then only BAT is applicable. 6.1.2. Level of aggregation at which best available technology is determined 38. Mechanism methodologies shall determine, or provide a procedure for activity participants  to determine, the applicability of the BAT baseline, including:  (a) Geographic scope;  (b) Technologies and/or practices for which it is applicable; and  (c) Validity over time. 39. The BAT approach may be applied at different levels and by different entities in line with  the description in Section 5.2 above, including by the proponent of the mechanism  methodology, the activity participant, or by host Parties. Next to such bottom-up  approaches, the Supervisory Body may determine a BAT baseline following a top-down  process. BATs determined by these entities shall have the following geographic scopes:  (a) Supervisory Body: global, or a narrower scope set during the determination of the  BAT;  (b) Host Party: the national boundaries of the Party, or a sub-national scope within the  national boundaries;  (c) Mechanism methodology: the appropriate geographical area as determined in the  mechanism methodology, or a narrower scope specified in the mechanism  methodology for a subset of the potential users;  (d) Activity participants: the location of the corresponding Article 6.4 activity, or as  otherwise specified in the procedure of the mechanism methodology.  13 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 6.1.3. Determination of the best available technology baseline scenario 40. The baseline scenario based on BAT shall be identified as:  (a) An approved BAT determined by the Supervisory Body or by host Parties; or  (b) A BAT specified by the mechanism methodology or determined by the activity  participants following a procedure in the mechanism methodology. 41. When considering whether a technology and/or practice is an economically feasible  course of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or  practice is one that will typically provide sufficient returns to cover investment, operations  & maintenance costs. 42. For technologies and/or practices applied in households, the mechanism methodology  shall define “economically viable course of action” based on the type of activity and  characteristics of the users. The definition may be based on the commonly experienced  costs associated with the technology and/or practice and shall be based on an investment  analysis applying financial parameters that reflect access to finance by households in a  manner that does not overestimate financial barriers, and other relevant considerations. 43. When considering whether a technology and/or practice is an environmentally sound  course of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or  practice is in line with laws and regulations on environmental protection in the applicable  geographical area and seeks to reasonably minimize environmental harm.5 44. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the appropriate baseline geographic reference  area for determining the BAT or provide for principles and requirements that activity  participants shall apply to establish this area with proper justification. 45. The definition of BAT specifies that the technology and/or practice “is available in the  baseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the shelf, or via a tendering or direct  contracting process, or by direct implementation by an end user within the boundary of  potential Article 6.4 activities”. Mechanism methodologies shall consider that when the  Article 6.4 activity type is greenfield and may displace the implementation of new capacity,  then availability relates not just to the specific activity participant, but to any entities that  may implement similar technologies and/or practices; whereas, when the Article 6.4  activity type is implemented within existing installations, the availability may be limited to  those technologies and/or practices available to the activity participants. 46. When the BAT is specified in the mechanism methodology or by the activity participants  following the procedure in the mechanism methodology, then the BAT shall be determined  by applying at least the following steps:  (a) Define the technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity, their  output(s), users, sector and, where relevant, market penetration;  (b) Identify the available technologies and/or practices (and their combinations) in line  with the definitions in this standard for supplying the pool of users in the baseline  geographical reference area, at the scale required for implementation at a similar  level to the activity; 5 As assessed on a mechanism methodology basis or further defined by the Supervisory Body.  14 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (c) Identify which of these available technologies are environmentally sound;  (d) Identify which of the environmentally sound technologies are also economically  viable;  (e) Define the emissions or removals intensity of each of the remaining technologies  identified in step (d) above as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-eq) per  unit of output, based on the average conditions of the technology in the baseline  geographical reference area;  (f) Identify the remaining technology from step (e) above with the best emissions or  removals intensity. This technology constitutes the BAT and its emission or  removals intensity forms the basis for the baseline. 6.1.4. Determination of baseline emissions or removals 47. The mechanism methodology shall define the procedures to quantify the baseline  emissions and/or removals. When the baseline scenario is set using BAT, then the  quantification of the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the  emissions or removals intensity (as tCO2-eq per unit of output) of the identified BAT.  However, approaches other than BAT may be used to determine other parameters  required to quantify the baseline emissions and/or removals. 48. The BAT may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis. The  proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration of the  validity of the proposed methodology.6 6.2. Ambitious benchmark approach 6.2.1. Applicability 49. Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where reliable  data on best performing comparable activities providing similar outputs is available and  permits a conservative and reliable estimation of the baseline. 50. This approach may be particularly suitable where:  (a) The sector is characterized by homogeneous outputs, i.e., if there are similar  outputs with a similar level of service for the pool of users; and/or  (b) The emissions or removals per unit of output depend on multiple factors (inter alia,  technology and/or operational practices, fuels, feedstocks, local circumstances  such as climatic conditions). 6.2.2. Determination of the baseline scenario and baseline emissions and/or removals 51. The baseline scenario based on an ambitious benchmark shall be identified as the  average emissions or removals level of the best performing comparable activities  providing similar outputs in a defined scope in similar social, economic, environmental,  and technological circumstances. Mechanism methodologies shall further specify this 6 In case the validity of a BAT expires, users of the mechanism methodology may propose a request for  revision to update the underlying analysis and validity.  15 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  approach and justify the methodological choices made, including specification of the  criteria for similarity of circumstances. 52. Mechanism methodologies shall either directly set the ambitious benchmark, or define a  procedure that activity participants shall apply for setting the crediting baseline based on  an ambitious benchmark, considering the following steps:7  (a) Define and justify the appropriate baseline geographical reference area for the type  of technology and/or practice;  (b) Identify all technologies and/or practices (e.g., types of industrial plants, types of  household units, as applicable to the activity type) that are providing similar output  in the baseline geographical reference area in similar social, economic,  environmental, and technological circumstances8;  (c) Specify which comparable activities (e.g., individual installations or units such as  industrial plants, households) in the baseline geographical reference area shall be  included in the analysis, taking into account the type and characteristics of the  Article 6.4 activity. For example, if the Article 6.4 activity consists of the installation  of greenfield plants, then only recently built installations shall be included in the  analysis. For brownfield Article 6.4 activities (e.g., energy efficiency  improvements), existing installations may be considered, depending on the  circumstances. Similarly, only activities of a similar size (e.g., plants above a  certain threshold) or within certain locations (e.g., only households in rural areas)  may be considered, depending on the context of the Article 6.4 activity. If an Article  6.4 activity replaces existing installations while at the same expanding the capacity,  comparable activities shall include installations, or combinations of installations,  that can provide the same level of service as the Article 6.4 activity;  (d) Select a suitable indicator for determining the performance of the comparable  activities (e.g. tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, energy efficiency of  appliances);  (e) Determine the appropriate time period for which available performance data for all  identified technologies and/or practices shall be included. In some cases, one year  may be an appropriate period In cases where the performance varies significantly  between calendar years (e.g., due to differences in climatic conditions such as  precipitation), an appropriate multi-year period (e.g., three years) shall be selected.  The choice shall be appropriately conservative and be justified;  (f) Collect recent performance data for the comparable activities of the identified  technologies and/or practices in the baseline geographical reference area; 7 Mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches towards determining an ambitious  benchmark. 8  For example, for cement for building construction applications, the technologies are those being  applied for building construction with similar structural capabilities, e.g., other cement production for  concrete-based construction, wood-frame construction, steel-frame construction, masonry. For another  example, metal-alloy production, the technologies are those being applied for the same metal-alloy  production.  16 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  (g) Prepare a performance distribution curve, using the selected indicator such as  tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, for the total amount of output provided  by the comparable activities in the baseline geographical reference area;  (h) Specify how to define the group of best performing comparable activities bounded  at maximum by the 20th percentile of the distribution curve or lower (e.g., 10th  percentile, 5th percentile), and justify the choice;  (i) Calculate the weighted average (by output) performance of all the best performing  comparable activities including and beyond the selected percentile, using the  selected indicator such as tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output. 53. The value determined in sub-bullet (h) constitutes the ambitious benchmark and shall form  the basis for quantifying the baseline emissions and/or removals. 54. Mechanism methodologies shall define the methods for quantification of the ambitious  benchmark baseline. When the baseline scenario is set using an ambitious benchmark,  then the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the benchmark.  However, other parameters needed to quantify baseline emissions and/or removals may  be derived using other approaches (for example, an ambitious benchmark for the energy  efficiency of comparable activities may be combined with a default value for the specific  GHG intensity per unit of energy). 55. When the ambitious benchmark is determined by activity participants, by applying a  procedure defined in a mechanism methodology, the mechanism methodology shall  specify which type of data sources may be used by activity participants. The mechanism  methodology should aim to ensure that the data is both of high quality and recent,  preferably with a vintage of no more than 3 years prior to the year in which the PDD is  submitted for global stakeholder consultation. 6.3. Existing actual or historical emissions approach 6.3.1. Applicability 56. Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where there  is limited data availability on the emissions or removals performance from similar activities  in the sector. 57. This approach may be particularly suitable where:  (a) Emissions or removals per unit of output are dependent on factors that are highly  activity- or site-specific; and/or  (b) Sector data shows strongly heterogeneous circumstances. 58. Where an Article 6.4 activity replaces specific equipment that was used in the pre-project  scenario and could continue to be used, a baseline scenario determined using this  approach shall only remain valid until, at maximum, the end of the reasonably expected  remaining lifetime of the equipment that was used in the pre-activity scenario. 6.3.2. Baseline scenario selection 59. The baseline scenario may be identified based on existing actual or historical emissions.  17 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 60. The mechanism methodology shall specify a pre-determined baseline scenario or contain  a procedure to determine the baseline scenario. Possible baseline scenarios may include:  (a) The continuation of the pre-activity scenario up to a certain point in time (for  example, up to the time at which a retrofit would have occurred);  (b) A dynamic baseline scenario over time (for example, if a gradual shift away from  the pre-activity scenario is observed);  (c) The retrofit or replacement of equipment that has been used in the pre-activity  scenario;  (d) The implementation of the Article 6.4 activity at a later point in time. 6.3.3. Methods for quantification of baseline emissions and/or removals 61. The mechanism methodology shall define the methods to quantify the baseline emissions  and/or removals as tCO2-eq or the baseline emissions or removals intensity as tCO2-eq  per unit of output. The determination shall be consistent with the identified baseline  scenario. The baseline may be derived using the following general methods:  (a) Site-specific historical data: Where this method is used, the mechanism  methodology shall address issues related to the minimum number of historical  years to consider, year-on-year variability, any trends in the historical data and the  need for the use of factors to account for improvements in performance that may  occur in the baseline scenario over time;  (b) Control group: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall  establish requirements related to selection of the control group; shared  characteristics between the activity and control groups such as location, pre-  activity and project technologies and/or practices, and socio-economic  circumstances; and statistical tests for similarity between the control and activity  group;  (c) Model: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall address the  selection, calibration, capabilities, credibility and conservativeness of models; and  (d) Default factors: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall  specify the source of the default factors used and ensure their relevance and  conservativeness. 7. Determination of the downward adjustment 62. Mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition through setting crediting baselines  below BAU and increasing the ambition of crediting baselines over time. Therefore,  mechanism methodologies shall include factors or quantitative methods for downward  adjustment appropriate to the sector, Article 6.4 activity type and scale of the activity. The  factors or quantitative methods shall be based on clear and objective criteria and shall  result in a downward adjustment that ensures the selected baseline is below BAU and  encourages ambition over time.  18 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 7.1. Downward adjustment in the calendar year of the start date of the first  crediting period 63. For baselines determined based on BAT or an ambitious benchmark, no downward  adjustment shall apply in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. 64. For baselines determined based on existing actual or historical emissions, the downward  adjustment in the calendar year of the start of the first crediting period shall be determined  as follows:  (a) Through the following step-wise procedure:  i. Determine the uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval  relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified unadjusted net  baseline emissions and/or removals at 95% confidence level during the first  crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 ). The determination of the uncertainty  shall consider all causes of uncertainty as per paragraph 13 of section 4 in  Appendix 1;  ii. Determine the downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or removals  based on uncertainty for the calendar year of the start date of the first  crediting period (BEadj,U,y), as follows9;  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 ) Equation (1)  Where:  Downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 =  removals based on uncertainty in year y  Unadjusted existing actual or historical net baseline  𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 =  emissions and/or removals in year y  Uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty  interval relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante  𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 =  quantified unadjusted net baseline emissions and/or  removals during the first crediting period (fraction)  Calendar year of the start date of the first crediting  y =  period  iii. Determine the minimum downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or  removals for the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period  (BEadj,min,y), as follows;  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 − (𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 − 𝐴𝐸𝑦 ) ∗ 0.1 Equation (2)  Where:  Minimum downward adjusted baseline  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 =  emissions and/or removals in year y. 9 Where, for the uncertainty of a central value, the absolute upper bound is a positive number and the  absolute lower bound a negative number, or vice-versa, further guidance will be developed.  19 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  Unadjusted existing actual or historical net baseline  𝐵𝐸𝐴𝑐𝑡/𝐻𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝑦 =  emissions and/or removals in year y  Ex-ante estimated activity emissions and/or removals in  𝐴𝐸𝑦 =  year y  y = Calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period  iv. Compare the downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or removals  based on uncertainty (BEadj,UNC,y) and the minimum downward adjusted  baseline emissions and/or removals (BEadj,min,y) and select the lower as the  downward adjusted baseline;  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑦 = min(𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 , 𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 ) Equation (3)  Where:  Downward adjusted baseline emissions  𝐵𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑗,𝑦 =  and/or removals in year y  Calendar year of the start date of the first  y =  crediting period  OR  (b) Through another approach proposed in the mechanism methodology,  considering the minimum downward adjustment described in the method above. 7.2. Downward adjustment in subsequent years 65. For all three baseline approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs (i.e., BAT, ambitious  benchmark, and existing actual or historical emissions), a downward adjustment shall  apply in all calendar years following the start date of the first crediting period, unless an  exemption in specific circumstances is approved by the Supervisory Body. 66. Such exemptions shall only apply to baselines based on BAT or ambitious benchmarks.  Economic viability could be a consideration for exemptions, for example, where the  application of a downward adjustment may result in no calculated emission reductions or  net removals. 67. The downward adjustment applied in subsequent years shall increase over time to  encourage ambition over time and ensure that the baseline is below BAU. 68. For baselines determined based on existing actual or historical emissions, the starting  point for increasing the downward adjustment over time shall be the downward adjustment  in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period, as determined in section  7.1 above. For baselines determined based on BAT or an ambitious benchmark, the  downward adjustment shall increase from a value of zero applied in the calendar year of  the start date of the first crediting period.  20 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 69. The increase in the downward adjustments over time shall be operationalised either as an  annual change or as stepwise change implemented not less frequently than every three  years. An increase in the downward adjustment shall be applied starting on 1 January of  a calendar year. The first increase shall be applied in the calendar year following the  calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. 70. Mechanism methodology shall specify the factors or quantitative methods to calculate the  downward adjustment for subsequent calendar years of the crediting period and how the  increase over time is operationalised. The determination of the downward adjustment may  be based on the following principles and considerations:  (a) Consideration of economic viability of the mitigation technologies and/or  practices: The quantitative methods and factors could consider the economic  viability of the relevant mitigation activities. This holds in particular for critical  mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization technologies,  and negative emission approaches. The quantitative methods and factors could  result in relatively lower downward adjustments for these technologies and  approaches, and other critical technologies at an early stage of innovation and  diffusion, compared with technologies and/or practices that are closer to being  economically viable;  (b) Setting incentives for the adoption of less GHG intensive technologies  and/or practices: The factors and quantitative methods could result in a relatively  higher downward adjustment for more GHG intensive technologies and/or  practices and a relatively lower downward adjustment for less GHG intensive  technologies and/or practices10;  (c) Consideration of established long-term pathways: Already established long-  term pathways for emissions, technologies and/or practices adopted by Parties,  groups of Parties and/or international industry associations could inform the  downward adjustment. This could mean that some sectors, regions or Parties  would have greater annual increases to the downward adjustment compared with  others;  (d) Consideration of concept of sufficiency: Considering work on sufficiency  presented in IPCC AR6 WGIII, Chapter 9, the factors and quantitative methods  could result in a relatively higher downward adjustment for activities implemented  in a context of high resource consumption patterns and a relatively lower downward  adjustment for lower resource consumption patterns11;  (e) Consideration of suppressed demand: The quantitative methods and factors  could result in a relatively lower downward adjustment for sectors or regions where  demand is suppressed. 10 For example, the downward adjustment may be higher for Article 6.4 activities flaring landfill gas than for  activities using the landfill gas as fuel; 11 For example, in the buildings sector, it may be proposed that for communities whose energy consumption  was historically high, the rate of reducing emissions is higher than that for communities with historically  low energy consumption  21 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 71. The annual increase in the downward adjustment shall correspond to at least 1% of the  baseline emissions in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. A pro-  rata approach may be used to apply this minimum value to periods other than a full  calendar year. 8. Determination of a conservative business-as-usual  baseline 72. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to demonstrate that the downward  adjusted baseline is below BAU. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall  require the identification of a conservative BAU scenario that would occur in the absence  of the Article 6.4 activity and provide a method for the quantification of the corresponding  BAU emissions and/or removals in a conservative manner. The BAU also may be defined  using an approved standardized baseline. 73. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall consider the following alternatives for  the purpose of determining the BAU scenario and justify the choice, including how it  ensures conservativeness:  (a) Continuation of the historical situation (pre-activity scenario);  (b) Establishment of an economically viable technology and/or practice;  (c) A scenario combining (a) for the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or  practice, followed afterwards by (b); or  (d) Only when it is justified that the previous alternatives are not suitable, another  relevant scenario in line with the applicable principles and requirements set out in  this standard. 74. Where several scenarios are plausible, the most conservative scenario shall be chosen  as the BAU scenario. 75. The proponent of a mechanism methodology may consider the following approaches for  estimating the BAU emissions and/or removals and shall justify the choice:  (a) Where the activity is not a greenfield activity, mechanism methodologies may  consider the historical emissions or emissions intensity prior to the implementation  of the activity, including any trends toward improving performance, for the  remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice; or  (b) Where the activity is a greenfield activity, or where it operates beyond the end of  the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice, mechanism  methodologies may consider the average emissions intensity of new capacity  installed in the past three years, in the baseline geographical reference area,  and/or in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances  and providing similar outputs as the activity with these criteria specified further in  the mechanism methodology.  22 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 76. In determining the BAU scenario and quantifying the BAU emissions and/or removals  pursuant to paragraphs 72 to 75 above, mechanism methodologies shall identify and  incorporate in the BAU:  (a) Any policies that are active or scheduled to take effect within the crediting period,  unless they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for  implementation. All legal requirements shall be deemed to be enforced while  recognizing that regulatory environments vary; and  (b) Any specific national or sub-national targets for the sector or the type of activity, as  long as these are supported by policy frameworks for implementation12, but not  general goals that are not specific to the sector or type of activity. 77. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the comparison of the downward adjusted  baseline with the BAU baseline in section 5 (Step 5 in Figure 1) results in the determination  of a crediting baseline that is below BAU. For this purpose, mechanism methodologies  shall identify the conservative BAU baseline as follows:  (a) Through the following step-wise procedure:  i. Determine the uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval  relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified BAU net baseline  emissions and/or removals during the first crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 ).  The determination of the uncertainty shall consider all causes of  uncertainty as per paragraph 13 in Appendix 1;  ii. Determine the conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals  based on uncertainty for the relevant year or period (BAUcons,UNC,y), as  follows13;  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 ) Equation (4)  Where:  Uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval  relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified most  𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 =  likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals during the  first crediting period year y (fraction)  Conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 =  on uncertainty in year y  Most likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals in  𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝑦 =  year y  y = Relevant year or period (see instructions below) 12 The extent to which the policy frameworks in place are sufficient to enable the achievement of the targets  may be considered in determining their relevance for the BAU scenario and quantification, as well as  whether they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for implementation. 13 Where, for the uncertainty of a central value, the absolute upper bound of the uncertainty interval is a  positive number and the absolute lower bound of the uncertainty interval a negative number, or vice-  versa, further guidance will be developed.  23 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  iii. Determine the minimum conservative value of the BAU baseline during the  first crediting period as follows:  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 − (𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 − 𝐴𝐸𝑦 ) ∗ 0.1 Equation (5)  Where:  Minimum conservative BAU baseline emissions  𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 =  and/or removals in year y  𝐴𝐸𝑦 = Activity emissions and/or removals in year y  Y = Relevant year or period (see instructions below)  iv. Compare the conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based  on uncertainty (BAUcons,UNC,y) and the minimum conservative BAU baseline  emissions and/or removals (BAUcons,min,y) and select the lower as the  conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals;  𝐵𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑦 = min(𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 , 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 ) Equation (6)  Where:  Conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or  𝐵𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑦 =  removals in year y  Relevant year or period (see instructions  y =  below)  OR  (b) Propose another approach that ensures that the selected crediting baseline is  below BAU, considering the minimum discount described in the method above. 78. The BAU scenario and quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals shall be  determined:  (a) Ex ante in the PDD at the start of the first crediting period for the same duration as  the crediting period of the proposed Article 6.4 activity, specifying the BAU  emissions and/or removals for each calendar year within the crediting period; and  (b) Ex post for each calendar year within the crediting period. 79. For the ex-post quantification of the BAU baseline emissions and/or removals, mechanism  methodologies shall specify which parameters are determined ex-ante and remain fixed  for the crediting period and which parameters are updated for each calendar year or at a  different frequency. 80. The BAU scenario shall be redetermined at each crediting period renewal and the same  analysis shall be carried out.  24 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 9. Comparison and selection of crediting baseline 81. Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to require activity participants to  undertake the following comparisons. 82. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to compare, ex-ante in the  project design document, the following two baselines:  (a) The downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3; and  (b) The conservative BAU baseline resulting from Step 4. 83. Where the ex-ante conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals is lower than  the ex-ante downward adjusted baseline for any calendar year or cumulatively over the  crediting period, then the mechanism methodology shall require the activity participant to  return to Step 3 and revise the quantitative methods and factors to determine the  downward adjustment, to ensure that the downward adjusted baseline is lower than the  conservative BAU baseline for each calendar year and cumulatively for the crediting  period. 84. Mechanism methodologies shall further require activity participants to compare, ex-post  in monitoring reports, for each individual calendar year during the crediting period, the ex-  post calculated downward adjusted baseline for the year and the ex-post calculated  conservative BAU baseline for the same year and confirm that the downward adjusted  baseline is lower than the conservative BAU baseline. If it is not, then the conservative  BAU baseline shall be used for that calendar year.  25 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 Appendix 1. General requirements for mechanism  methodologies 1. Applicability conditions 1. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the conditions under which proposed Article 6.4  activities may use the methodology. Applicability conditions shall clearly describe the  technologies and/or practices which are eligible under a methodology as well as, if  appropriate, those which are not. 2. Applicability conditions shall also prevent the use of the methodologies in contexts,  configurations and cases for which these are not intended and under which an  overestimation of emission reductions or net removals and/or perverse incentives could  occur. 3. For each applicability condition, the mechanism methodology shall specify whether the  fulfilment of the condition shall be assessed:  (a) Once at the initial validation of the PDD or, where the information is not yet  available, at the first verification of emission reductions or net removals; or  (b) At each verification of emission reductions or net removals. 2. Definition of the activity boundary 4. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all emission sources, sinks or  reservoirs that could be altered by Article 6.4 activities that are eligible under the  methodology. For each identified source, sink or reservoir, the proponent shall indicate  whether it pertains to the baseline scenario and/or the Article 6.4 activity scenario. The  proponent shall compare the sources, sinks and reservoirs between the two scenarios in  a tabular format to ensure a complete and fair comparison. 5. The proponent shall further indicate whether each identified source, sink and reservoir is  controlled, related to, or otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4 activities, in line  with the definitions, and provide adequate justification. Note that some sources, sinks or  reservoirs may be classified in different ways, depending on the configuration of the Article  6.4 activity1; where applicable, this should be indicated. 6. Based on this analysis, mechanism methodologies shall define the activity boundary of  the applicable Article 6.4 activities, including which emission sources, sinks or reservoirs  and GHGs are included. The activity boundary shall be presented in table, covering both  the Article 6.4 activity scenario and the baseline scenario. 1 For example, in some activities, a source of transport emissions may be controlled whereas in others it  may be related.  26 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 7. The activity boundary shall include all emission sources, sinks or reservoirs that are  identified as controlled or related. The activity boundary also may include sources, sinks  or reservoirs that are identified as otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4  activities. 2 Changes in anthropogenic emissions and/or removals of GHGs that occur  outside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity shall be considered  as leakage, subject to the provisions in the draft standard “Addressing leakage in  mechanism methodologies”. 8. Mechanism methodologies may omit sources, sinks or GHGs from the activity boundary,  provided that the omission leads to a more conservative quantification of emission  reductions or net removals. For example, where it can be demonstrated for the range of  activities that may apply the methodology that upstream emissions associated with the  Article 6.4 scenario are lower than upstream emissions associated with the baseline  scenario, the relevant upstream emissions may be omitted in both the Article 6.4 activity  scenario and the baseline scenario. The mechanism methodology may also specify  conditions under which certain sources, sinks, reservoirs or GHGs shall be considered or  may be omitted. The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall demonstrate and  provide appropriate justifications for any such omissions, including that the omission is  conservative for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology. 9. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to delineate the geographical  boundary of a proposed Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies may require activity  participants to specify the location of the activity in the form of Keyhole Markup Language  files or similar formats as one or more polygon(s), by specifying the coordinates of the  geographic boundary using a known coordinate system or any other method to delineate  the geographic boundary. The geographic boundary may cover more than one host Party.  Where appropriate, the mechanism methodology may request the location of the leakage  emission sources and sinks to be described as well. 10. Mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the activity, does not  constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party  with regard to the nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, its long-term  low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS), if it has submitted one,  and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and long-term goals of the  Paris Agreement through an assessment, undertaken by the DNA of the host Party, of the  activity’s consistency with Decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 40 (c) and paragraph 27 (a) as  part of the host Party’s approval. 3. Calculation of emission reductions or net removals 11. Mechanisms methodologies shall include provisions to determine emission reductions or  net removals separately for each calendar year. To address situations where monitoring  periods cover more than one calendar year, mechanism methodologies shall specify  methods to allocate the emission reductions or net removals achieved during a monitoring  period to calendar years. The method of allocation shall be based on the best 2 For example, for activities that provide renewable electricity to the grid and thereby affect electricity  generation by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a  baseline emission source within the activity boundary.  27 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  approximation for when the emission reductions or net removals have likely occurred. The  following approaches shall be used:  (a) Proportional allocation: Where this is plausible, emissions or removals in the  monitoring period shall be allocated proportionally to the duration of the period in  each calendar year. If annual caps or other annual values are applied in the  methodology, these shall be pro-rated to periods shorter than a full calendar year;  (b) Allocation based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns: Where  proportional allocation is not plausible, emissions or removals in the monitored  period shall be allocated based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns.  For example, for an afforestation activity, growth tables for the respective species  and local conditions may be used to allocate a stock change observed over a multi-  year period to individual calendar years; 12. Mechanism methodologies shall specify whether the type of Article 6.4 activities covered  by the methodology may generate emission reductions, net removals, or both emission  reductions and net removals. Where Article 6.4 activities may generate both emission  reductions and net removals, mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to  separately determine the emission reductions and the net removals that have occurred in  a monitoring period. 4. Conservativeness and uncertainty 13. Mechanism methodologies shall apply a conservative approach to ensure that the  emission reductions or net removals from an Article 6.4 activity using the methodology are  very unlikely to be overestimated, taking into account the overall uncertainty in quantifying  the emission reductions or net removals. The implementation of conservativeness (e.g.,  through conservative assumptions, parameters, discounts) in determining the calculated  emission reductions or net removals shall be based on the level of uncertainty (e.g.,  applying a larger deduction in case of higher uncertainties). All causes of uncertainty shall  be considered, including uncertainty in data (e.g., measurements), parameters (e.g.,  representativeness of default values), assumptions (e.g., the baseline scenario), and  methods (e.g., models to quantify emission reductions). 5. Attributability of emission reductions or net removals to the Article 6.4  activity 14. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the quantified emission reductions or net  removals result from the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and not from changes in  exogenous factors that are not related to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity.  Mechanism methodologies shall therefore require approaches that take into account and  adjust for exogenous factors affecting emission reductions or net removals. 6. Potential perverse incentives 15. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify any potential perverse  incentives for the activity participants to inflate the calculated emissions reductions or net  removals. This may include cases where output levels could increase as a result of the  incentive of the mechanism. Where such perverse incentives can occur, the mechanism  methodology shall ensure that they are avoided.  28 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0 7. Rebound effects 16. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that rebound effects (i.e., an increase in the level  of service as a result of the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity, e.g., when introducing  energy-efficient appliances) are accounted for. Where applying the provisions with regard  to suppressed demand, further requirements or guidance from relevant other standard(s)  may be considered. 8. Avoidance of double counting 17. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify risks of potential double  counting of the emission reductions or net removals and, where such risks are relevant  and material, include provisions to avoid such double counting in the mechanism  methodology. This shall include but not be limited to:  (a) Double counting due to overlapping claims between different crediting mechanism  activities;  (b) Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes; and  (c) Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets. 8.1. Double counting due to overlapping claims between different carbon crediting  mechanism activities 18. Double counting may occur if different carbon crediting mechanism activities claim the  same emission reductions or removals. The consideration of this form of double counting  shall include but not be limited to:  (a) The risk of different entities claiming the emission reductions or removals  associated with the production and use of goods or services (e.g., both the  producer and the consumer of a biofuel claiming the same emission reductions);  (b) The risk of overlap from emission sources or carbon pools that occur upstream and  downstream of the activity (e.g., an efficient cookstove activity and an avoided  deforestation activity claiming the same emission reductions);  (c) The risk of overlap due to implementation of activities at different aggregation  levels within the same geographical area (e.g., a project-scale avoided  deforestation activity falling within the scope of a jurisdictional avoided  deforestation activity). 19. This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by requiring  agreement between the entities that may potentially seek carbon credits for the same  emission reductions or removals. 8.2. Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes 20. Double counting may occur if an Article 6.4 activity reduces emissions or enhances  removals that are covered by a mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g. an emissions  29 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  trading system). This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies  by:  (a) Excluding activities or not issuing Article 6.4 ERs for emission reductions or  removals that are subject to such overlap; or  (b) Requiring that measures are in place to ensure that any relevant impacts of the  activity (e.g., inter alia the GHG emission reductions achieved or the kilowatt-hours  of renewable electricity produced) are not counted towards the achievement of  targets or obligations under the mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g., inter  alia by cancelling allowances from the emissions trading system before issuing  carbon credits). 8.3. Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets 21. Double counting may occur if the mitigation outcomes achieved by an Article 6.4 activity  are also claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets (e.g. guarantees of origin  for renewable electricity generation, green hydrogen schemes, low carbon fuel standards,  etc.). Note that this only holds if mitigation outcomes (e.g., emission reductions, removal  enhancements, renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, etc.) are  claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets, but not where other outcomes  (e.g., air contaminant reductions or social impacts) are claimed. 22. This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by:  (a) Excluding activities or not issuing Article 6.4 emission reductions for emission  reductions or removals that are subject to such overlap; or  (b) Requiring that the Article 6.4 activity does not claim the same mitigation outcomes  in the relevant other environmental markets or accounting frameworks. 9. Monitoring 23. Mechanism methodologies shall specify procedures and methods for the monitoring all  data and parameters necessary to calculate the emission reductions or net removals from  Article 6.4 activities using the methodology. 24. Further requirements related to monitoring may be introduced in this standard in the future. 10. Aggregation of information 25. Where appropriate, mechanism methodologies may consolidate information within a  geographical area and a sector, to provide observations at a broader level than an  individual Article 6.4 activity. Comparable activities can be grouped or aggregated to  provide a broader picture when this does not lead to misrepresentation. Comparable  activities can also be split or disaggregated, when this does not lead to misrepresentation,  for example when the sector shows great heterogeneity. 11. Validity and periodic updating of mechanism methodologies 26. In accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of  methodologies and methodological tools”, approved methodologies and methodological  tools that have been applied in projects shall be reviewed on a regular basis. The review  particularly shall seek to incorporate, or substitute, sources and types of data, and update  the methodological approaches and assumptions, to enhance the application of the  30 of 31  A6.4-STAN-METH-004 Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies Version 01.0  principles and general requirements in section 4 of this standard. This may include the  adoption of new measurement approaches, such as the use of remote sensing and digital  technologies. Each version of a mechanism methodology shall specify until when it is valid  for use, taking into account the methodological approaches, assumptions and data  sources used in the methodology, as well as trends and developments in the sector. The  validity shall not exceed five years.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 16 May 2025 SBM 016, Annex 12.  Initial adoption.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted the rules, modalities and procedures  (RMPs) for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement  (Article 6.4 mechanism)1 In the RMPs, the CMA further requested the Supervisory Body  to establish the requirements and processes necessary to operate the mechanism,  including those relating to the application of robust, social and environmental safeguards  to Article 6.4 activities and/or A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs) and to develop tools  and approaches for assessing and reporting information about how each activity is  fostering sustainable development, while acknowledging that the consideration of  sustainable development is a national prerogative. 2. The RMPs also recalled the eleventh preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement,  “Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should,  when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their  respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of Indigenous  Peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in  vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality,  empowerment of women and intergenerational equity”.2 3. The adoption of the Article 6.4 sustainable development tool (hereinafter referred to as the  A6.4 SD Tool) will necessitate updates to the relevant Article 6.4 standards and  procedures. These updates will ensure alignment with the new A6.4 SD Tool requirements  for reporting, validation and verification. 4. The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism, at its fourteenth meeting (SBM 014),  approved the A6.4 SD Tool. 1.2. Objective 5. The objective of the A6.4 SD Tool is to ensure that Article 6.4 projects and/or Article 6.4  PoAs, collectively referred to as A6.4 activities, uphold the principle of “do no harm”, foster  sustainable development (SD), and contribute to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs).3 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Scope, applicability, and entry into force 2.1. Scope 6. The A6.4 SD Tool applies to all A6.4 activities 4 including all clean development  mechanism (CDM) activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism.  Its scope encompasses the decisions of the CMA, which outline the formal expectations  for the Article 6.4 mechanism, as well as the rules and requirements developed by the  Supervisory Body for operationalizing the mechanism.5 Specifically, the tool provides a  means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory  requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for  assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to SD in line with SD  objectives and priorities of the host Party and the SDGs. 7. To achieve its objective, the tool provides a structured approach for activity participants  to:  (a) Conduct a risk assessment to identify risks and potential impacts, evaluate  them, and avoid harm where possible. When avoidance is not feasible, the A6.4  SD Tool instructs participants to minimize impacts as much as possible and,  finally, to mitigate any remaining negative environmental and social impacts and  risks by establishing activity-level environmental and social indicators;  (b) Identify and assess potential positive and negative impacts on the 17  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and host Party SD priorities and  establish activity-level SD monitoring indicators;  (c) Monitor and report the outcomes of the monitoring against the established  activity-level environmental and social indicators and activity-level SD indicators. 2.2. Applicability 8. The use of the A6.4 SD Tool is mandatory for all proposed A6.4 activities, including all  CDM activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2.3. Entry into force 9. Version 01.0 of the A.6.4 SD Tool enters into force on 9 October 2024. This document  shall be reviewed every 18 months. 4 In addition to this general tool, additional safeguards criteria and guiding questions to be applied for  carbon dioxide removal activities and for land use, land-use change and forestry activities will be  developed by the Supervisory Body as new annexes to include in this SD Tool at an appropriate stage  in its development of regulations for activities involving removals. 5 See Decision and documentation framework (A6.4-INFO-GOV-005) available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-005.pdf.  5 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 3. Article 6.4 Sustainable Development Tool  implementation 3.1. Overview of the A6.4 SD Tool 10. The A6.4 SD Tool requires activity participants to identify, evaluate, avoid, minimize, and  mitigate potential risks associated with proposed A6.4 activities. 11. Activity participants of A6.4 activities shall adopt mitigation strategies to avoid risks or,  where complete avoidance is not possible and activity implementation is nonetheless  permitted, minimize and mitigate identified risks. 12. Where complete avoidance of risk is not possible, activity participants of A6.4 activities  shall provide evidence, including monitoring of activity-level environmental and social  indicators, that the A6.4 activities comply with the environmental and social safeguarding  elements and criteria as defined in section 6 of this tool, including those relevant to the  eleventh preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement, 6 as well as relevant and  applicable national and international instruments to which the host Party is bound and  applicable legislation in the host Party (see figures 1 and 2). Such international instruments  may include, for example, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the  International Labour Organization fundamental conventions, and recognized international  best practices. 13. Activity participants are also required to:  (a) Identify and assess the potential positive and negative impacts of their A6.4  activities on the SD of the host Party(ies), by considering the host Party(ies)’ SD  objectives and priorities, as well as the SDGs;  (b) Establish activity-level SD indicators; and  (c) Monitor and report the outcome against the established indicators (see figures 1  and 3 and section 7.1). 3.2. Navigating the A6.4 SD Tool 14. The A6.4 SD Tool is divided into three key sections covering important processes, as  follows:  (a) Section 6 Environmental and social safeguards: 7 This section focuses on  elements and criteria that serve as the basis for activity participants to identify,  evaluate, avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative environmental and  social impacts and risks that may arise during the implementation and operation  of the A6.4 activity, or CDM activity transitioning the Article 6.4 mechanism.  Activity participants are required to conduct a risk assessment based on  safeguards’ elements and criteria as defined under Section 6, which leads to the  development of A6.4 Environmental and social management action plans. These  plans include activity-level environmental and social indicators for tracking  actions and acceptance criteria to demonstrate that the impacts and risks do not 6 See footnote 2. 7 Environmental and social safeguards commonly observed in other UN agencies, international financial  institutions and voluntary carbon market systems.  6 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  cause harm to the environment or society. The outcomes of the risk assessment  and the plans shall be documented in:  (i) A6.4-FORM-AC-015: A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form. This form records the identification, evaluation, and  avoidance of environmental and/or social risks that may be caused by a  proposed A6.4 activity;  (ii) A6.4-FORM-AC-016: A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form. This form details the set of minimization and mitigation measures and  monitoring to be implemented. It shall be completed if the conclusion of the  A6.4-FORM-AC-015 is “Yes” or “Potentially” (see figure 1 and figure 2).  (b) Section 7. Sustainable development impacts: This section focuses on  identifying the positive and negative SD impacts of the A6.4 activity, or a CDM  activity transitioning to the Article 6.4 mechanism. It outlines the processes for  the assessment of the SDGs impacted, the consideration of the host countries’  SD objectives and priorities, and the establishment of activity-level SD monitoring  indicators based on the SDGs and their targets. All activity participants shall  document the evaluation of SD impacts and the measuring, monitoring and  reporting methodology in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017: A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form (see figure 1 and figure 3);  (c) Sections 8 and 9. Validation and Verification: These sections outline additional  requirements to the Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standards  for projects and programmes of activities (VVS-P - VVS-PoA) 8 that shall be  considered by the designated operational entities (DOEs) during the validation  and verification stages. 3.3. Stakeholder engagement and the A6.4 SD Tool 15. Stakeholders may submit issues and comments related to compliance with the A6.4 SD  Tool during the local stakeholder consultation and the global stakeholder consultation prior  to the registration of the A6.4 activity.9 16. During the local stakeholder consultation, the three completed A6.4 SD Tool forms (see  sub-paragraphs 14(a) through (b)) shall be shared with stakeholders by the activity  participants.10 Further, during the global stakeholder consultation, Parties, stakeholders  and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations may submit comments on the three  completed A6.4 SD Tool forms. Any inputs received or issues raised by stakeholders  during these consultations shall be considered by activity participants for revising or  updating A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017. The  stakeholder inputs received and the revised forms shall then be submitted to a DOE for  validation.11 17. After the registration of the A6.4 activity under the Article 6.4 mechanism, activity  participants shall establish and maintain a continuous engagement mechanism for 8 See section 4: Normative references. 9 In accordance with sections 6.9 and 6.10 of Article 6.4 activity standard. 10 In accordance with host Party rules and/or section 6.9 and Appendix 2 of Article 6.4 mechanism activity  standards. 11 In accordance with section 4.6.1 of Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedures.  7 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  stakeholders to comment on compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool until the end of the valid  crediting period of the project.12 Activity participants, DOEs and the secretariat will make  their documents publicly available through their respective activity view pages hosted on  the UNFCCC website.13 12 As defined in section 7.1 of Article 6.4 activity standard, and appeal and grievance processes under the  Article 6.4 mechanism. 13 In accordance with section 6 to section 8 of Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure.  8 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 Figure 1.

The implementation of the A6.4 SD Tool is closely linked to adherence to the normative  references, ensuring alignment with the requirements for validating, registering, reporting,  and verifying A6.4 activities thereby ensuring compliance with the regulatory standards  and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism, as included in this section (18(b) through  (h)). The following documents are indispensable for the application of this tool:  (a) Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of  the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (17 SDGs);15  (b) Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard for activities (AS-P);  (c) Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard for programmes of activities (AS-PoA);  (d) Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standard for activities (VVS-P);  (e) Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standard for programmes of  activities (VVS-PoA);  (f) Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for activities (ACP-P);  (g) Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities (ACP-  PoA);  (h) Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 5. Definitions 19. The following terms apply in this tool:  (a) Activity-level environmental and social indicators: 16 A6.4 activity specific  indicators identified during the risk assessment that must be defined in the  completed A6.4-FORM-AC-016. These indicators help ensure that the A6.4  activities do not cause harm –– for example, to the environment, communities,  Indigenous Peoples, or activity workers;  (b) Activity-level SD indicators: 17 A6.4 activity-specific monitoring indicators,  consistent with the SDGs that represent A.6.4 activity contributions to SD. They 14 The rules and regulations for the Article 6.4 mechanism mentioned in the normative references are  accessible at: https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-  body/rules-and-regulations. 15 Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017 (A/RES/71/313). Available at:  https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/ 16 Examples of activity-level environmental and social indicators for an activity that requires water  consumption may include the activity-level indicator for the volume of water consumed per  month/day/time period in order to ensure that water consumption does not exceed the limit indicated in  the water use licence issued by the host Party’s authority. 17 Examples of activity-level SD indicators for a cookstove distribution activity may include:  12 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  reflect SD objectives as well as SD priorities defined by a host Party, which must  be specified in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017;  (c) Host Party legislation: Regulatory requirements such as national and/or  subnational laws and regulations applicable to the proposed A.6.4 activity;  (d) Stakeholders: The public, including individuals, groups or communities,  marginalized and disadvantaged groups, women, children, older persons,  persons with disabilities, minorities, Indigenous Peoples,18 or any other person  who may be affected or is likely to be affected by the proposed A 6.4 activity, or  by the actions leading to the implementation of such the activity;  (e) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A set of 17 interlinked global goals  designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.  They were established by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda  for SD. The 17 SDGs build upon the successes of the Millennium Development  Goals while incorporating new areas such as climate change, economic  inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, and peace and justice, among  other priorities;  (f) SD objectives and priorities of a host Party: The specific goals, targets, indicators,  and priorities that a country sets to achieve SD within its borders. These  objectives are aligned with the broader principles of sustainability, which aim to  balance economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. They  are typically articulated in national development plans, policies, and strategies  and are designed to address the unique challenges and opportunities within the  country. 6. Environmental and social safeguards 20. Based on the requirements specified in the regulations listed under Section 4: Normative  references, sub-paragraphs (b) through (g), regarding compliance with legal and  regulatory requirements of the host Party, activity participants shall document in the project  design document19 that their proposed A6.4 activity does not cause any environmental or  social harm.  (a) The number of improved cookstoves distributed under the activity, serving as an indicator for  providing basic service access to households under SDG 1, target 1.4;  (b) The percentage of users reporting a reduction in smoke/particulate matter after shifting to improved  cookstoves within the activity, addressing SDG 3, target 3.9;  (c) The percentage of users reporting time savings due to reduced fuel consumption or cooking time  within the activity, related to SDG 5 and its target 5.4; and/or  (d) The average percentage of fuel savings reported by users within the activity, pertaining to SDG 12  and its target 12.2. 18 Indigenous Peoples as described in Indigenous Peoples at the United Nations.

Environmental and social risk assessment: 21. Activity participants shall ensure the minimization and mitigation of potential risks that may  arise from a proposed A6.4 activity and provide documentary evidence that the A6.4  activity complies with the environmental and social safeguarding elements and criteria as  defined in section 6 of this tool, including those relevant to the eleventh preambular  paragraph of the Paris Agreement, as well as relevant and applicable national and  international instruments to which the host Party is bound. 22. The identification, evaluation, avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of potential risks  should be achieved by completing A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016. The  latter form specifically addresses the environmental and/or social risks identified in A6.4-  FORM-AC-015 by establishing activity-level environmental and social indicators (see  figure 1). 23. Step 1: Identify risks and potential negative impacts  (a) Activity participants shall conduct a risk assessment by completing the A6.4-  FORM-AC-015 to identify potential negative environmental and social impacts  arising from the implementation, operation and, if applicable, dismantling of the  A6.4 activity (see figures 1 and 2);  (b) The assessment shall be conducted against 11 elements and criteria, as described  in section 6.3: Environmental and social safeguards elements and criteria (see  figure 2). These elements are based on principles from other UN agencies,  international financial institutions and voluntary and independent carbon market  systems;20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27 20 Gold Standard (2023) Safeguard Principles & Requirements.

Element 8: Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement46  E8 description: 71. The Article 6.4 activity avoids involuntary resettlement. The A6.4 activity supports the  avoidance of activity-related land acquisition and restrictions on land use that lead to  adverse impacts on communities and persons, including physical displacement  (relocation, loss of residential land or loss of shelter) and economic displacement (loss of  land, assets, or access to assets, leading to loss of income sources or other means of  livelihood). Where involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, it is to be minimized, and  appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts on displaced persons (and on host  communities receiving displaced persons) are to be carefully consulted, planned and  implemented.  E8 criteria: 72. E8.1: In the implementation of the 6.4 activity, activity participants of the A6.4 activity are  to avoid involuntary resettlement. 73. E8.2: When physical displacement (i.e., relocation or loss of shelter) cannot be avoided,  activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to mitigate the displacement impacts on, and  risks for, displaced persons and host communities to, at minimum, restore their livelihoods  and/or living standards to pre-project levels. If the A6.4 activity involves Indigenous  Peoples, their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)47 must be obtained in accordance  with Element 9, included in section 6.4.6 of and in particular with criteria E9.5. 74. E8.3: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to mitigate impacts and risks of economic  displacement (loss of land, assets, or access to assets, leading to loss of income sources  or other means of livelihood), when economic displacement cannot be avoided. 75. E8.4: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to conduct a census and a socioeconomic  baseline survey to identify all affected individuals, groups or communities that will be  physically or economically displaced. A resettlement and/or livelihood action plans are to  be integrated into A6.4-FORM-AC-016 (see figure 1) where physical displacement is  involved. The action plan will be developed in accordance with international best practices  (e.g. United Nations Development Programme Standard 5: Displacement and  Resettlement 48), in full consultation with the affected individuals, groups or communities  and based on good-faith negotiations. Resettlement understandings reached by the  activity participants with affected individuals, groups or communities are to be reflected in  written agreements. 46 Involuntary resettlement refers to a scenario when affected persons or communities do not have the right  to refuse land acquisition or restrictions on land use that result in displacement. 47 FPIC is a specific right of Indigenous Peoples recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights  of Indigenous Peoples. FPIC allows Indigenous Peoples to engage in negotiations to shape the design,  implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the activity.

The activity participant of the A6.4 activity supports the creation of opportunities for  Indigenous Peoples to participate in and benefit from A6.4 activity-related initiatives that  may help them achieve their aspirations for economic and social development.  Furthermore, the Article 6.4 activity takes into account that Indigenous Peoples may play  a role in SD by promoting, owning and managing A6.4 activities and enterprises as  partners.  E9 criteria: 78. E9.1: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to identify all communities of Indigenous  Peoples within the A6.4 activity boundary that may be affected by the A6.4 activity. They  are to approach these communities with respect, sensitivity, and transparency ensuring  that Indigenous Peoples are fully informed and voluntarily participating in the identification  process. 79. E9.2: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity, with the full and effective participation of  Indigenous Peoples involved, are to carry out an environmental and social analysis of the  activities that may affect or involve Indigenous Peoples by completing A6.4-FORM-AC-  015 (see figure 1). Adequate resources for the full and effective participation of Indigenous  Peoples must be provided by activity participants of the A6.4 activity. The analysis should  include the potential impacts on their rights, lands, territories, gender relations, resources,  culture, cultural heritage49 and other potentially intangible impacts on Indigenous Peoples. 80. E9.3: A6.4 activities do not result in the forcible removal of Indigenous Peoples from their  lands and territories. No relocation is to take place without the FPIC of the Indigenous  Peoples concerned. FPIC must be documented, as well as the agreements reached in the  good faith dialogues, consultations, and negotiations with the Indigenous Peoples. 81. E9.4: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to recognize and respect the Indigenous  Peoples’ collective rights to own, use, develop and control the lands, resources, and  territories that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional  occupation or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired. 82. E9.5: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to respect, protect and conserve the  cultural, intellectual, religious and/or spiritual property of Indigenous Peoples. The activity  participants are not to access or utilize it without FPIC. FPIC must be obtained when there  are impacts on (i) territory or land or resources;50 (ii) cultural heritage; 51 or (iii) places  containing sacred elements of special value to the community.

This is to be undertaken  through good-faith negotiations in a manner that is culturally appropriate and inclusive,  and that does not impede land rights or equal access to basic services, including health  services, clean water, energy, education, safe and decent working conditions, and  housing. 6.4.7. Element 10: Corruption52  E10 description: 84. The A6.4 activity ensures the avoidance, prevention, and detection of corruption, and  responds to corruption or corruption attempts during activity design, development,  implementation and operation. To ensure this, activity participants of the A6.4 activity  recognize that corruption negatively impacts every aspect of society by diverting essential  resources needed to alleviate poverty, enhance health outcomes, and provide children  with quality education. 6.4.8. Element 11: Cultural heritage53  E11 description: 85. The A6.4 activity avoids impacts on cultural heritage. When avoidance of impacts is not  possible, activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to identify and implement measures  to address impacts on cultural heritage by completing A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan (see figure 1).  E11 criteria: 86. E11.1: The A6.4 activity does not cause or contribute to the alteration, damage, or removal  of any sites, objects, or structures of critical cultural heritage. 87. E11.2: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are responsible for designing the activity to  avoid significant adverse impacts on cultural heritage. The environmental and social risk  impact assessment should determine whether the proposed location of an activity is in  areas where cultural heritage is expected to be found during implementation or operations.  Activity participants of the A6.4 activity will not proceed with the activity until an  assessment by professionals and/or entities recognized by the host government,  academia and/or the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  (UNESCO)54 is made to ensure that no adverse impacts on cultural heritage will occur. If  the A6.4 activity involves Indigenous Peoples, FPIC must be obtained in accordance with  Element 9, included in section 6.4.6 of and in particular with P9.5 criteria. 52 Please refer to the paragraph 23(e). 53 See footnote 50. 54 UNESCO expert facility. Available at: https://www.unesco.org/creativity/en/expert-facility  26 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 88. E11.3: Where the A6.4 activity proposes to utilize cultural heritage, including the  knowledge, innovations, or practices of local communities, the affected communities are  to be informed of their rights, 55 the scope and nature of the proposed commercial  development, and the potential consequences of such development. 7. Sustainable development impacts 89. Activity participants shall identify and assess the potential positive and negative direct  impacts56 of their A6.4 activities on the SD of the host Party(ies) by considering the host  Party(ies) SD objectives and priorities (see section 7.1) and the SDGs; establishing  activity-level SD indicators and monitoring and reporting the outcomes against the  established indicators. 7.1. Demonstrating positive and negative SD impacts 90. Step 1: Identify SD objectives and priorities of host Party (see figure 1)  (a) Activity participants shall identify the host Party’s SD objectives and priorities,  which may include national strategies for SD and/or SDG achievement, SDG  national targets and indicators, and economic, social and environmental  indicators related to the A6.4 activity;  (b) If the host Party defines national strategies for SD, SDG achievement, or SDG  national targets and indicators relevant to section 6.3.6 of the A6.4 activity,  activity participants shall explicitly identify any SDG-specific objectives and  priorities in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017;  (c) Activity participants shall also identify any host Party objectives and priorities that  are not clearly responsive to any SDG in the same form. 91. Step 2: Assess impacted SDGs (see figures 1 and 3)  (a) The “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and  targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”57 provides 17 SDGs,  169 targets and 249 indicators, which must be consulted by activity participants  when identifying the impacted SDGs;  (b) Activity participants shall identify the SDGs that the A6.4 activity directly impacts  positively and/or negatively. Activity participants shall provide justification for any  excluded SDGs, considering the SD objectives and priorities of the host Party,  including those described above and the criteria defined in paragraph 95(c) below  (see figures 1 and 3);  (c) Impacts on the SDGs and their goals shall: 55 Cultural heritage is preserved, protected, and promoted in mitigation activities in a manner consistent  with UNESCO Cultural Heritage conventions or any other national or international legal instruments that  might have a bearing on the use of cultural heritage. 56 Direct impact: an impact based on direct contribution or interaction by an activity with an environmental,  social, or economic component during the implementation and operation, and if applicable dismantling. 57 The latest “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development” is available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-  list/ in six official languages of the United Nations.  27 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  (i) Be relevant to the A6.4 activity type;  (ii) Result in a direct impact (i.e., the A6.4 activity is the main driver of change);  (iii) Be recurring/lasting during the crediting period of the A6.4 activity and impact  the stakeholders and/or local environment in a direct and measurable way;  (d) Once activity participants identify SDGs impacted by the A6.4 activity, they are  required to:  (i) Review the respective targets defined under the identified SDGs from the  latest “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and  targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”;  (ii) Select target(s) under the SDGs based on the criteria defined in the paragraph  95(c) above;  (iii) Review indicators defined under the selected target(s) within the identified  SDGs and select relevant indicator(s). Since these indicators are defined at  regional and national levels, activity participants shall develop their own  activity-level SD indicators, as per step 3 below. 92. Step 3: Establish A6.4 activity-level SD indicators (see figures 1 and 3)  (a) Activity participants shall establish A6.4 activity-level SD indicators for each  identified direct impact to the SDG resulting from the activity, taking into  consideration the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators. All relevant SDG  targets and corresponding indicators for each SDG should be chosen (see figures  1 and 3, and table 3 below);  (b) When activity participants identify negative impacts on any of the 17 SDGs, they  should refer to the outcomes of the risk assessment (see Section 6 above, Steps  1 and 2);  (c) If the identified negative impacts on the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators  are already considered in A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016, activity  participants do not need to establish relevant activity-level SD indicator(s);  (d) If the identified negative impacts on the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators  are not already considered in A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016,  activity participants are required to establish relevant activity-level SD indicator(s)  to minimize and mitigate the identified negative impacts. Where complete  avoidance of identified negative impact is not possible, activity participants shall  provide evidence, including monitoring of activity-level SD indicators, that the  A6.4 activities align with host Party legislation. 93. A6.4 Activity-level SD indicator(s) can be qualitative or quantitative and shall be  monitorable over the crediting period. The A6.4 activity-level SD indicator(s) shall:  (a) Be in line with the objectives and intent of the SDGs and their corresponding  targets;  (b) Be directly impacted by the activity; 58 58 See footnote 56.  28 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  (c) Not be a one-off occurrence;  (d) Include the monitoring approach and parameters, including the frequency of  monitoring, to be used for each selected activity-level SDG target indicator defined  in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017.

Monitoring procedures for A6.4 activity-level SD indicators 94. Activity participants shall describe in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017 the monitoring procedures  of A6.4 activity-level SD indicators, including:  (a) The A6.4 activity-level SD indicators, including selected SDGs, SDG targets and  SDG indicators;  (b) Data unit and source of data;  (c) Information on monitoring/measurement procedures/methods;  (d) Monitoring frequency (at least annual). 95. Based on the requirements specified in the regulations listed under Section 4: Normative  references, sub-paragraphs (b) through (g), once activity participants complete the A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 reflecting inputs received or issues raised by stakeholders during local and  global stakeholder consultations, the outcome (including the form) must be shared with  the DOE performing validation. 96. Once the A6.4 activity is registered, activity participants shall monitor and report the  outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level SD indicators in the monitoring report, as per the  A6.4-FORM-AC-017. A DOE is required to verify the monitoring of the indicators during  each request for issuance of A6.4 ERs. 8. Validation 97. The requirements for validation of A6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4 validation  and verification standards for projects and PoAs.59 98. The DOE shall validate the appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of the information  provided in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016, and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as  reported in the project design document by:  (a) Step1: reviewing stakeholder consultation documents [inputs/comments];  (b) Step 2: conducting interviews with local stakeholders;  (c) Step 3: reviewing relevant host party documentation;  (d) Step 4: providing a validation opinion employing professional judgement and as  per A6.4 validation and verification standard for projects and PoAs. 99. The DOE shall validate:  (a) Both quantitative and qualitative information provided, to assess the adequacy of  the identification of environmental and/or social risks caused by the A6.4 activity.  The validation should be done by taking the four steps referred to in paragraph  97 above, in order to:  (i) Validate the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan presented in A6.4-  FORM-AC-015, as per the provision referred to in paragraph 12; 59 See Section 4: Normative references.  31 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  (ii) Validate that the activity-level environmental and social indicators defined in  the A6.4 environmental and social safeguards risk assessment ensure that the  A6.4 activities do not cause harm, to the environment and stakeholders.  (b) That the outcome of A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016, and A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 have been shared during the local stakeholder consultation and  that inputs received from the consultation are reflected in the completed form;  (c) That there is an established continuous engagement of local stakeholders in  accordance with the AS-P or the AS-PoA;60  (d) The appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of the information provided in  the A6.4-FORM-AC-017 by taking the four steps referred to in paragraph 97  above in order to:  (i) Validate that the SD objectives and/or criteria of the host Party documented in  A6.4-FORM-AC-017 are in line with the host Party’s definition (when  available);  (ii) Validate that the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-  017 are universally applicable to the activity type and significant,  recurring/lasting for at least the entire crediting period of the A6.4 activity, and  impacting the primary stakeholders and/or local environment in a direct and  measurable way, resulting in a primary benefit;  (iii) Validate that the description of A6.4 activity-level SD indicators is accurately  reflected in A6.4-FORM-AC-017. 100. The DOE shall provide a validation opinion stating that, based on A6.4-FORM-AC-016  and A6.4-FORM-AC-017, the A6.4 activity results in no harm and contributes to SD. 101. If the DOE identifies the presence of unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the  environmental and social safeguards elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by  consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative validation opinion as per the  A6.4 validation and verification standard61 or submit a deviation request to the Supervisory  Body prior to submitting a request for registration. Box 1 below contains a best practice  example of validation. 60 Ibid. 61 See paragraph 64 of VVS-P and paragraph 160 of VVS-PoA.  32 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  Box 1. Best practice example of validation  A proposed activity is to distribute energy-efficient appliances to households in coastal  and peninsular areas. An activity participant identifies that their activity contributes to  SDG 1462 and SDG 1563 based on the location of the proposed activity, which is near to  the marine and forest ecosystem. During the validation, the DOE raises a corrective action  request (CAR) asking the activity participants to clarify how the proposed activity’s  impact on SDG 14 and SDG 15 is direct and primary, as per section 7.1 of the applied tool.  The activity participants acknowledge that their activity does not directly contribute to  SDG 14 and SDG 15 and excludes these contributions to SDG 14 and SDG 15 from A6.4-  FORM-AC-017. Based on this revision, the DOE closes its CAR accordingly. 9. Verification 102. The requirements relating to the verification for A 6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4  validation and verification standards for projects and PoAs.64. The DOE shall verify the  appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of information provided in the monitoring of  the environmental and social indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4 activity-level SD  indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as reported in a monitoring report. 103. If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 that were validated at the registration, it will provide its verification opinion  on the observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and  environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-  016 and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 104. The DOE shall review any input and comments received via continuous engagement of  local stakeholders in accordance with the AS-P or AS-PoA,65 conduct interviews with local  stakeholders, and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post  fulfilment of risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity. 105. The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and  reported parameters established in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017  submitted at the registration stage. 106. If the DOE identifies unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the parameters  established in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 and cannot be remediated  by consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion as per  the A6.4 validation and verification standard or submit a deviation request to the  Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance. Box 2 below contains a best  practice example of verification. 62 SDG 14 (life below water) is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources  for sustainable development. (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14) 63 SDG 15 (life on land) is protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,  sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt  biodiversity loss (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15). 64 See Section 4: Normative references. 65 Ibid.  33 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1  Box 2. Best practice example of verification  Activity participants identify the A6.4 activity’s contribution to SDG 866 based on jobs  generated from the proposed activity and include the number of generated jobs in A6.4-  FORM-AC-017 as a monitoring indicator. During the verification of the number of jobs  generated under SDG 8, a DOE identifies that the number includes short-term  construction phase jobs and raises a CAR asking activity participants to clarify how the  inclusion of short-term construction phase jobs aligns with section 7.1 of the applied tool,  which requires SD impact to be significant and recurring/lasting for at least the entire  crediting period of the activity. The activity participants acknowledge that the inclusion  of short-term construction phase jobs is not in line with the SD impact defined in section  7.1 of the applied tool, and the DOE closes the CAR by verifying a revised number that  does not include short-term construction phase jobs. 66 SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) is to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic  growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8).  34 of 59  A6.4-TOOL-AC-001 Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool Version 01.1 Guiding questions for the risk assessment of the  environmental and social safeguards elements  and criteria Instruction 1.

The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop  provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,  monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the  mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters  V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the  operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3 3. The Supervisory Body, at its ninth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 activity standard for  projects” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that sets out the requirements relating  to the design, implementation and other attributes of Article 6.4 mechanism projects (A6.4  projects). 4. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the  requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of  Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies  standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article  6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article  6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two  standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4  mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas  the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have  met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental  risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to  sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of  the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). 5. The Supervisory Body, at its fifteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Demonstration of  additionality for mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the additionality  standard) that sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to  demonstrating additionality. 1.2. Objectives 6. The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to the design,  implementation and other attributes of A6.4 projects. 1 Decision 3/CMA.3, annex A available at:  https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25. 2 Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a). 3 Decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapters III‒VI.

It does not apply to distributed unit projects in  which the project boundary consists of a region. 8 Examples of “types and levels of services” include the amount of a certain type of cement produced or  the amount of electricity fed into the electricity grid.  7 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 6.3. Double or revived registration 17. The activity participants shall confirm that the proposed A6.4 project is none of the  following:  (a) Already registered as an A6.4 project;  (b) Already included as a component project (CP) in a registered Article 6.4  mechanism programme of activities (A6.4 PoA);  (c) Previously deregistered from the Article 6.4 mechanism. 18. Additionally, the activity participants shall confirm one of the following:  (a) The proposed A6.4 project is not currently registered or being pursued for  registration, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional,  national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme;  (b) The proposed A6.4 project was previously registered under or covered by a  programme under any other international, regional, national, or subnational or  sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme but deregistered or excluded from  the other crediting scheme before fully exhausting the crediting period under the  other crediting scheme;  (c) The proposed A6.4 project is currently registered or covered by other international,  regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme. 19. For the cases described in paragraph 18(b) above, the activity participants shall obtain a  confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of deregistration or  exclusion and the remaining crediting period under the other crediting scheme at the time  of deregistration or exclusion. 20. For the cases described in paragraph 18(c) above, the activity participants shall obtain a  confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of the registration or  coverage, the start and end dates of the crediting period, and the monitoring periods for  which credits have been issued under the other crediting scheme. 21. If the proposed A6.4 project was a CP that has been excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA,  the activity participants shall ensure that:  (a) The PDD transparently declares that the project was a CP that has been previously  excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to erroneous  inclusion;  (b) The crediting period type (i.e., renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting  period are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of  the exclusion. A6.4ERs may be claimed for the period only after the effective date  of registration as an A6.4 project, as per the activity cycle procedure, and:  (i) If the crediting period is renewable, the request for registration shall be  submitted by the validating DOE within one year of the end date of the  crediting period valid for the CP at the time of the exclusion. Missing this  deadline precludes the submission of the request for registration;  (ii) If the crediting period is fixed, the request for registration shall be submitted  by the validating DOE prior to the end date of the crediting period valid for  8 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  the CP at the time of the exclusion. Missing this deadline precludes the  submission of the request for registration;  (c) The project meets all relevant registration requirements of projects valid at the time  of submission of the request for registration as an A6.4 project;  (d) If the project applies a methodology that potentially accrues negative GHG  emission reductions, GHG emission reductions have been continuously monitored  in accordance with the monitoring plan as described in the CP design document  (CP-DD) and verified by a DOE since the end of the monitoring period in the last  published monitoring report that covered the CP, including the exclusion period.  For such project, if net negative GHG emission reductions occurred during the  period before the registration as an A6.4 project, the equivalent amount shall be  deducted from the first requests for issuance of A6.4ERs after the registration;  (e) If the CP has been excluded due to erroneous inclusion and if A6.4ERs were  issued for the CP, an equivalent amount of A6.4ERs have been compensated by  the DOE that included the CP, to the Article 6.4 mechanism registry in accordance  with the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. 22. The activity participants shall declare, if applicable, the existence of a registered A6.4  project, CP under a registered A6.4 PoA or an activity under any other international,  regional, national or subnational GHG mitigation crediting scheme whose crediting period  has or has not expired (hereinafter referred to as former project) in the same geographical  location as that of the proposed A6.4 project. 23. If the activity participants identify that the proposed A6.4 project is in the same  geographical location as that of a former project, they shall declare that the proposed A6.4  project will not lead to the discontinuation or modification of the former project and does  not decrease the levels of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals by the former  project, and that the proposed A6.4 project complies with the following conditions:  (a) It utilizes both different measure and a different technology(ies), technique(s)  and/or resource(s) from those of the former project;  (b) It does not share or utilize any of the assets of the former project;  (c) It utilizes a different resource type compared to the former project. 24. The following definitions shall apply for paragraph 23 above:  (a) Measure: fuel/feedstock switch, technology switch, methane destruction and  methane avoidance;  (b) Technology: equipment or conversion process used for the production of goods or  provision of services. Two technologies are considered to be the same  technologies if they:  (i) Provide the same kind of output and use the same kind of equipment and  conversion process; or  (ii) Undertake the same course of action that results in the same kind of effect;  (c) Assets: resources with economic value that an individual, corporation or country  owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide future benefit; the assets  could be physical, such as project equipment, or non-corporeal such as permits  9 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  and exclusive position in legislation. The definition of assets in this context  excludes land;  (d) Output: amount of goods or services produced by a technology;  (e) Resource: a source of supply or support needed for the production of an output. It  may include categories of goods, energy and energy carriers that are supplied into  the project location and are required for the implementation of the project /CP, such  as fossil fuel, by-product of a process, biomass, solar, wind and geothermal heat. 25. If the proposed A6.4 project involves the implementation of distributed units in households  and the conditions in paragraph 23(a)−(c) above are not met, the activity participants shall  request a DOE to validate and confirm by other means that the project will not lead to the  discontinuation or modification of the former project, and does not decrease the GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals by the former project, in accordance with the  “Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects” (hereinafter referred as the  validation and verification standard). 26. In all other cases, the activity participants may submit a communication to the Supervisory  Body to request clarification prior to the submission of a request for registration. 6.4. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines 27. The activity participants shall select valid9 methodologies that have been approved by the  Supervisory Body, applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and, if applicable, are  compatible with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party  in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. 28. In selecting a methodology for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants may, in  accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies  and methodological tools\":  (a) Propose a new methodology;  (b) Propose a revision to an approved methodology;  (c) Seek clarification on the applicability of an approved methodology; or  (d) Request approval of deviation from an approved methodology or methodological  tool. 29. The activity participants may select a standardized baseline that has been approved by  the Supervisory Body if it is valid10 and applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and to the  selected methodology in accordance with the applicability section of the standardized  baseline (hereinafter referred to as selected standardized baseline). 9 The valid version of a methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission of the  request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat in accordance with the activity  cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version, for use in accordance with the  “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”. 10 The valid version of a standardized baseline is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission  of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat in accordance with the  activity cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance with  the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.  10 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 30. Notwithstanding paragraph 29 above, the activity participants shall select an approved  standardized baseline for the proposed A6.4 project if the standardized baseline is valid,  applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and to the selected methodology, and the selection  of the standardized baseline is mandatory in accordance with the applicability section of  the standardized baseline11 or required by the host Party in accordance with paragraph  27(a) of the RMPs.12 31. In selecting a standardized baseline for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants  may, in accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update  of standardized baselines” (hereinafter referred to as the standardized baseline  procedure):  (a) Propose a new standardized baseline;  (b) Propose a revision to an approved standardized baseline;  (c) Seek clarification of an approved standardized baseline; or  (d) Propose an updated standardized baseline. 6.5. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines 6.5.1. General requirements 32. The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC  reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized  baselines that are applied to the proposed A6.4 project, including any other methodologies  or methodological tools to which the selected methodologies refer. 33. The activity participants shall demonstrate why the selected methodologies, standardized  baselines, and any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines  applied in accordance with the selected methodologies (hereinafter, “any other standards,  methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines (to be) applied in accordance with the  selected (applied) methodologies” are collectively referred to as the other applied  methodological regulatory documents) are applicable to the proposed A6.4 project. This  shall be done by showing that the project meets all applicability conditions of these  regulatory documents and, if applicable, is compatible with the methodological  requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)  of the RMPs. 34. The activity participants shall ensure that the proposed A6.4 project complies with all the  requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and other  applied methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological  requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)  of the RMPs. 11 The date when the selection of a standardized baseline becomes mandatory is to be determined in  accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update of standardized  baselines”. 12 Such standardized baselines may, for example, state in their applicability section that the latest approved  and valid values of the standardized baseline are the only values of the carbon dioxide emission factor(s)  that shall be applied for the project electricity system.  11 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 6.5.2. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases 35. The activity participants shall describe the project boundary of the proposed A6.4 project,  including the physical delineation of the project using GPS coordinates where appropriate.  The activity participants shall further specify which sources, sinks and GHGs are included  within the project boundary, in accordance with the applied methodologies and the applied  standardized baselines. In this context, project boundary is the physical delineation or  geographical area that encompasses sources, sinks and GHGs under the control of the  activity participants, which are significant and reasonably attributable to the project in  accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable, the applied  standardized baselines. 36. If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity  participants to choose whether a source, sink or GHG is to be included in the project  boundary, the activity participants shall explain and justify their choice. 6.5.3. Baseline scenario 37. The activity participants shall establish and describe the baseline scenario for the  proposed A6.4 project in accordance with: the applied methodologies; standardized  baselines; a more ambitious baseline requirement determined by the host Party and  approved by the Supervisory Body; other applied methodological regulatory documents;  and the provisions outlined in paragraphs 38–42 below and, where applicable, the  baseline approaches specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of  the RMPs. 38. The activity participants shall provide information on the facilities, systems and equipment  to be operated both under the proposed A6.4 project and the baseline scenario. 39. When establishing the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee that future  anthropogenic emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to  specific circumstances in the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed  demand in the applied methodology or propose a revision to an approved methodology to  cover such scenario if it is not covered in the methodology. 40. In case of replacement of existing equipment, the activity participants shall estimate the  point in time when the existing equipment would be replaced in the absence of the  proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the guidance on determining the remaining  lifetime of equipment in the applied methodology if applicable. 41. If the proposed A6.4 project is registered under or covered by another international,  regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the most  conservative baseline scenario between that is required by the applied methodology and  that is set under such other crediting scheme, in accordance with guidance to be provided  by the Supervisory Body. 42. Notwithstanding paragraphs 37‒41 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an  approved standardized baseline that standardizes baseline scenario, the activity  participants shall describe the baseline scenario as per the applied standardized baseline.  12 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 6.5.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark 43. The activity participants shall identify and describe the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario  or reference benchmark emissions for the proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the  applied methodologies or other applied methodological regulatory documents. 6.5.5. Demonstration of additionality 44. The activity participants shall demonstrate, in accordance with the applied methodologies,  other applied methodological regulatory documents, and the requirements related to prior  consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in section 6.1 above, that the  proposed A6.4 project would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the  Article 6.4 mechanism. 45. Activity participants shall ensure that additionality is demonstrated for an A6.4 project in  its entirety and is not separately demonstrated for different parts of an A6.4 project,13  unless the different parts can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect  each other.14 46. Additionality shall be demonstrated following the requirements for demonstration of  additionality included in the applied methodologies, using a robust assessment that shows  the project would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism.  This assessment should be made, taking into account all relevant national policies,  including legislation, and represent mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required  by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that avoids locking in levels of  emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with paragraph 33 of  the RMPs. 47. Activity participants shall, in accordance with the applied methodologies, demonstrate  additionality using the appropriate approaches for demonstration of additionality, including  regulatory analysis, analysis of lock-in risk, investment analysis, barrier analysis, common  practice analysis and performance-based approach. 48. For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the  PDD as part of the investment analysis. 6.5.6. Addressing non-permanence for projects involving removals and emission  reduction projects with reversal risks 49. For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  activity participants shall, in the PDD, identify and assess the risks of reversals, aligned  with the provisions of the removals standard and other applied methodological regulatory  documents approved by the Supervisory Body, and conduct the risk assessment in  accordance with the applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory  documents. 50. The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to: 13 For example, if a project involves the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the landfill gas for  energy generation, additionality should be demonstrated for both parts together, and not separately for  the landfill gas capture part and for the energy generation part. 14 For example, if the project involves the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the  catalytic abatement of N2O emissions at a nitric acid production plant.  13 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (a) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity costs;  (b) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,  acts of terrorism, crime and war;  (c) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and geological  faults and fractures;  (d) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks. 51. The risk assessment shall include:  (a) A risk mitigation plan using the reversal risk assessment tool to be developed by  the Supervisory Body to identify, assess and mitigate reversal risks; and  (b) The calculation of an overall percentage-based risk rating (hereinafter referred to  as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals, taking  into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood and duration of the risks. 52. The risk assessment shall be reviewed and revised by activity participants and verified by  a DOE every five years from the start of the first crediting period and in any of the  circumstances referred to in paragraph 72 below. 6.5.7. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals 53. The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex-post calculation of  baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by the proposed A6.4 project. The activity  participants shall also provide the ex-ante calculation of those for each year of the crediting  period, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines  and other applied methodological regulatory documents. If the proposed A6.4 project  contains more than one component, the activity participants shall apply this requirement  for each component separately. The activity participants shall describe all steps to be  undertaken for these calculations and provide all results. 54. For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the estimation of  removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the PDD in accordance with the  methodology(ies) applicable to the project. 55. The activity participants shall calculate the difference between baseline emissions and  BAU emissions for each year of the crediting period and the total amount over the crediting  period to determine a downward adjustment based on BAU. 56. The activity participants shall determine whether the baseline must be adjusted downward  as per the guidance below:  (a) The activity participants shall describe in the PDD the factors and quantitative  methods for downward adjustment and update them at each renewal of the  crediting period in accordance with paragraphs 55 above and 56(b) below. Activity  participants shall also apply more stringent factors or quantitative methods  determined by the host Parties for downward adjustment, according to their  circumstances;  14 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers the  economic viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and  decarbonization technologies, and negative emission approaches while ensuring  that methodologies are aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris  Agreement, and may be operationalized through:  (i) Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies  approved by the Supervisory Body that may be proposed by activity  participants or stakeholders;15  (ii) Factors or quantitative methods jointly developed by the Supervisory Body  and the host Party;  (iii) Factors or quantitative methods developed by the host Party that are  specified to the Supervisory Body for approval;  (c) If the downward adjustment based on the BAU referred to in paragraph 55 above  is greater than the downward adjustment determined based on paragraphs 56(a)  and 56(b) above, no further adjustment to the baseline is required; otherwise  further adjustment is required to align with the result of paragraphs 56(a) and 56(b)  above to ensure consistency with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMPs,  in accordance with other applied methodological regulatory documents. 57. The activity participants shall determine the leakage emissions in the PDD as follows:  (a) Identify all potential sources of leakage that may reasonably be attributable to the  activity following the applicable methodology and other applied methodological  regulatory documents. If any of the sources of leakage is excluded from  consideration, proper justification shall be provided;  (b) Describe how each of the sources of leakage identified above will be avoided or  minimized and accounted for, following the applicable methodology and other  applied methodological regulatory documents;  (c) Take into account relevant information from the designated national authority  (DNA) of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of  other applied methodological regulatory documents. 58. If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied  methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide  different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify  their choice. 59. To determine the performance of the equipment used in the proposed A6.4 project, when  required for calculating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the activity  participants shall use: 15 Activity participants or stakeholders may propose factors or quantitative methods for the consideration  of the Supervisory Body in consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being  involved. If a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the \"Procedure:  Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\" shall be applied.

The activity participants shall use the valid version of the norms, specifications, standards  and test procedures referred to in the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents, as available at the time  of submission of the request for registration. 61. The activity participants shall provide the data and parameters that will not be monitored  but are determined before the registration of the proposed A6.4 project and remain fixed  throughout the first crediting period, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents.  These data and parameters shall be available at the time of the validation of the project  for registration. 62. The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation  of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the proposed A6.4 project results  in conservative estimates. 63. The activity participants may use sampling for the determination of parameter values for  calculating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals if the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory  documents allow this. In such cases, the activity participants shall develop and describe a  sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for Article 6.4  mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body. 6.5.8. Monitoring plan 64. The activity participants shall develop and describe a monitoring plan for the proposed  A6.4 project in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, as well as all other  applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and the provisions outlined in  paragraphs 66–69 below. 65. For projects involving removals, activity participants shall carry out the monitoring of  removals based on data derived from measurements, sampling, remote-sensing, third-  16 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  party sources and published literature that are robust and statistically representative,  conservative and take appropriate account of the associated uncertainties. 66. In developing a monitoring plan for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants shall  apply the following requirements, unless specified otherwise in the applied methodologies,  the applied standardized baselines or other applied methodological regulatory documents:  (a) Data variables that continuously impact the GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals (e.g. quantity of fuel inputs, amount of heat or electricity produced, gas  captured) shall be measured continuously and recorded at appropriate intervals;  (b) Measuring equipment shall be certified to national or IEC standards;  (c) The calibration of measuring equipment shall be carried out by an accredited  person or institution;  (d) Measured data with high levels of uncertainty shall be compared with data from  other sources to ensure consistency. 67.

The monitoring plan shall include all data, parameters and related information required by  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents, including:  (a) Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures;  (b) Uncertainty levels, methods and the associated accuracy level of measuring  instruments to be used for various parameters and variables;  (c) Specifications of the calibration frequency for the measuring equipment. If no  requirements for calibration frequency for measuring equipment is specified in the  applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied  methodological regulatory documents, or the Supervisory Body’s guidance, the  activity participants shall ensure that the equipment is calibrated in accordance  with the local/national standards or the manufacturer’s specifications. If  local/national standards or the manufacturer’s specifications are not available,  international standards may be used. 69. The monitoring plan shall also include a description of the monitoring management  system, including the following elements:  (a) The operational and management structure to be put in place to implement the  monitoring plan;  17 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) Provisions to ensure that data monitored and required for verification of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals and issuance of A6.4ERs is kept and  archived for at least two years after the end of the final crediting period or the last  issuance of A6.4ERs, whichever occurs later;  (c) Definitions of responsibilities and institutional arrangements for data collection and  archiving. 70. Unless the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents state otherwise, the activity participants may opt for  a delayed submission of the monitoring plan, which can occur after the registration of the  proposed A6.4 project and:  (a) At any time prior to the submission of the request for issuance of A6.4ERs for the  first monitoring period; or  (b) Together with the request for issuance of A6.4ERs for the first monitoring period. 71. If the activity participants choose to delay the submission of the monitoring plan in  accordance with paragraph 70 above, they shall clearly state in the PDD that the  submission of the monitoring plan is delayed and therefore the PDD submitted for  registration of the proposed A6.4 project does not contain information related to the  monitoring plan. 72. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment shall be reviewed and updated during the  crediting period and verified by a DOE if:  (a) The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan  based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan and the risk assessment  plan;  (b) Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are  not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;  (c) The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk  factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring  plan and the risk assessment plan. 6.6. Start date, crediting period type and duration 73. The activity participants shall determine the start date of the proposed A6.4 project as the  date on which they commit to making expenditures for constructing or modifying the main  equipment or facility (e.g., a wind turbine), or for providing or modifying a service (e.g.,  distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, change of transport management system) under  the proposed A6.4 project. If a contract for such expenditures (e.g. for procurement of a  wind turbine) is signed, the start date is the date on which the contract is signed. In other  cases, it is the date on which such expenditures are incurred. If the proposed A6.4 project  involves more than one of such contracts or incurred expenditures, the start date is the  earliest of the respective dates. Activities incurring minor pre-project expenses (e.g.,  feasibility studies, preliminary surveys) are not considered in the determination of the start  date. 74. The start date of the proposed A6.4 project shall be on or after 01 January 2021.  18 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 75.

The activity participants shall indicate in the PDD the same crediting period type  (renewable or fixed), start date and duration of the crediting period for the proposed A6.4  project as approved by the host Party in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,  which is:  (a) For GHG emission reduction projects:  (i) Each renewable crediting period shall be maximum five years and may be  renewed maximum twice, for a maximum total length of 15 years, or any  shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph  27(b) of the RMPs or by the applied methodologies; or  (ii) A fixed crediting period shall be maximum 10 years, or any shorter crediting  period specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs  or by the applied methodologies;  (b) For GHG removal projects, each renewable crediting period shall be maximum 15  years and may be renewed maximum twice, for a maximum total length of 45  years, or any shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to  paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs or by the applied methodologies. 77. The start date of the crediting period may be as early as 1 January 2021, but no later than  two years from the date of the submission of the PDD for global stakeholder consultation  in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 78. A project that has been registered as an A6.4 project may not be re-registered after the  expiration of its final crediting period. 6.7. Environmental, social and sustainable development impacts 79. The activity participants shall carry out an analysis of the environmental, social and the  sustainable development impacts of the proposed A6.4 project, and provide, in the PDD,  a summary of the analysis and a monitoring plan of such impacts and planned remedial  measures of negative impacts, if any, during the implementation and operation of the  project in accordance with the A6.4 SD Tool, and the filled in forms required by the A6.4  SD Tool as follows:  (a) Provide the identification, evaluation and avoidance of environmental and/or social  risks that may be caused by a proposed A6.4 activity in the A6.4 Environmental  and social safeguards risk assessment form;  (b) Provide the relevant mitigation and minimization measures and monitoring to be  implemented in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form in cases  where risks are identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk  assessment form;  (c) Provide the evaluation of sustainable development impacts and the measuring,  monitoring and reporting methodology in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form.  19 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 80. In addition, if an environmental impact assessment and/or social impact assessment were  carried out for the proposed A6.4 project as required by and in accordance with relevant  procedures of the host Party, the activity participants shall provide all conclusions of such  assessments and references to all related documentation. 81. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by activity participants or by the DOE  during the validation, that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and  criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants may  request a deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4 SD Tool forms  accordingly. 6.8. Integrity safeguards 82. The development, implementation and operation of a proposed A6.4 project shall not  involve any illegal activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery and  criminal activities. For this purpose, the activity participants shall prepare a declaration  and submit it to the DOE as part of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project  in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 6.9. Local stakeholder consultation 83. The activity participants shall conduct a local, and where appropriate, subnational  stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively referred to as local stakeholder  consultation) on the proposed A6.4 project. The local stakeholder consultation shall be  conducted in accordance with applicable host Party rules and align with the modalities  contained in Appendix 2 and any additional elements for consultation required by the A6.4  SD Tool, at minimum. In this context:  (a) If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional  elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool, require more than those  required by the host Party rules, the activity participants shall follow the former,  covering any gaps between the two;  (b) If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional  elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool, and those required by the  host Party rules are not compatible where it is not possible to follow the  requirement in subparagraph (a), the activity participants shall describe the  modalities chosen and justify the choice. 6.10.

Post-registration changes 7.3.1. General requirements 91. If there are any changes to the modalities or information in the MoC statement referred to  in paragraph 86 above after the request for registration has been submitted, the activity  participants shall revise the MoC statement and obtain approval of the changes from the  secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. 92. The activity participants shall identify any proposed or actual changes to the  implementation, operation or monitoring of the registered A6.4 project. 93. The activity participants shall determine whether the proposed or actual changes referred  to in paragraph 92 above are temporary deviations, as referred to in section 7.3.2 below,  or permanent changes, as referred to in section 7.3.3 below. 94. For temporary deviations, the activity participants are not required to prepare a revised  PDD but shall describe the actual changes in the monitoring report. For permanent  changes, the activity participants shall prepare a revised PDD, the revised A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the revised A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and the revised A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form (both in track-change and clean versions) reflecting the  proposed or actual changes, using the valid version of the applicable PDD form. The  activity participants shall also provide a summary of the changes, including the reasons  for the changes and any additional information relating to the changes to the PDD.  21 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 7.3.2. Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms  (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form, and the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 95. If the activity participants are temporarily unable to monitor the registered A6.4 project in  accordance with the monitoring plan outlined in the registered PDD (hereinafter referred  to as the registered monitoring plan), the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the applied methodologies, the  applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants shall describe the nature, extent and  duration of the non-conforming monitoring period in the monitoring report, and:  (a) Propose alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-conforming monitoring  period. In this case, the activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions  or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of  the deviation; or  (b) Apply the following most conservative values approach when alternative  monitoring arrangements are not proposed:  (i) If the A6.4 project is to achieve GHG emission reductions, apply zero for  baseline GHG emissions for the entire non-conforming monitoring period; or  (ii) Apply the values assuming that the source of GHG emissions is operated at  the maximum capacity for the entire non-conforming monitoring period. In  the case of project GHG emissions related to the consumption of electricity,  add 10 per cent to account for transmission and distribution losses. 96. If the monitoring of environmental, social and sustainable development parameters results  in negative impacts that exceed the risks identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form and the indicators defined in both the A6.4  Environmental and social management plan form and in the A6.4 Sustainable  development impact form and cannot be remediated by conducting additional consultation  with stakeholders or by employing mitigation measures, the activity participants shall  describe the reasons for the negative impact and the measures that will be employed to  prevent the negative impact in the future. 7.3.3. Permanent changes 7.3.3.1. Corrections 97. If the activity participants make any corrections to the project information or parameters  fixed at the registration of the A6.4 project, as described in the registered PDD, the activity  participants shall document these corrections in a revised PDD.16 16 This provision does not allow the parameter values fixed ex ante at the time of the registration of the  A6.4 project to be updated, as it is not regarded as a correction.  22 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 7.3.3.2. Changes to the start date of the crediting period 98. The activity participants of a registered A6.4 project may request a change to the start  date of the crediting period of the project if no request for issuance for the project has been  submitted yet and if the host Party approves the change in accordance with the activity  cycle procedure. In this context:  (a) The new start date shall not be later than two years from the date of submission of  the PDD for global stakeholder consultation conducted prior to registration in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure;  (b) Delaying the start date by up to one year or bringing forward the start date shall  not require any review and change to the application of methodologies and  standardized baselines;  (c) Delaying the start date by more than one year shall require full review and possible  changes to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized  baselines. 7.3.3.3. Inclusion of monitoring plan 99. The activity participants may submit the monitoring plan of an A6.4 project after its  registration in accordance with paragraph 70 above. In this case, if, at the time of  submission of the monitoring plan, there is a newer version of any of the methodologies  applied at the registration of the project, the activity participants shall prepare the  monitoring plan and revise other sections of the PDD by applying the latest valid version  of the methodology(ies). 7.3.3.4. Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool  forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the  A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4  Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of  monitoring from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other  applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool 100. If the activity participants are unable to implement the registered monitoring plan, or if the  monitoring would permanently deviate from the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,  including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants shall describe the nature and extent  of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed alternative monitoring for the project  in a revised PDD. 101. If the monitoring would permanently deviate from the A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the activity participants shall  describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed  alternative monitoring for the project in the revised A6.4 Environmental and social  safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form. 102. If the monitoring plan and risk assessment plan need to be reviewed and updated as per  paragraph 72 above, the activity participants shall describe the changes to the monitoring  plan and risk assessment plan in a revised PDD.  23 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 103.

Changes to project design 104. Where there are changes to the project design of a registered A6.4 project, the activity  participants shall prepare a revised PDD describing the nature and extent of the proposed  or actual changes. 105. Changes to a registered A6.4 project may include:  (a) Increasing the capacity17 specified in the registered PDD, subject to the following  conditions:  (i) An increase of the capacity that would result in additional GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals up to the same level as the materiality  thresholds for verification defined in the “Article 6.4 validation and verification  standard for projects”, which are:  a. 0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of 500,000 tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent or more per year;  b. 1 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of between 300,000  and 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year;  c. 2 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects  achieving a total emission reduction or removal of 300,000 tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent or less per year;  (ii) An increase of the capacity that would result in additional GHG emission  reductions or net GHG removals exceeding the respective thresholds  referred to in subparagraph (i), subject to the approval of such increase by  the host Party;  (b) Decreasing the capacity specified in the registered PDD;  (c) Updating the inputs to the investment analysis if the PDD was submitted for  validation prior to the start date of the project based on information and data that  was available at the start date of the project. This is only applicable for projects  that have demonstrated additionality through an investment analysis;  (d) Adding new components or extending/adding technologies/measures, subject to  the approval of the host Party, that introduces: 17 Installed/rated capacity that directly impacts GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.  24 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (i) Complementary technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy  transfer to/from the technologies/measures specified in the originally  registered PDD;18 or  (ii) More advanced version of the same technologies, as per the definition of “the  same technologies” in paragraph 24(b) above (e.g. improved performance in  GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, efficiency, health, safety  and durability evidenced according to a relevant national or international  standard);19  (e) Removing a component or technology/measure specified in the registered PDD;  (f) Changing the technologies/measures to those that result in the same  technologies/measures as the ones in the originally registered PDD as per the  definition of “the same technologies” in paragraph 24(b) above;20  (g) Removing from or adding one or more site to the project registered with multiple  sites;  (h) Changing the actual operational parameters that are within the control of the  activity participants, that differ from the expected parameters;  (i) Any consequential changes to the application of methodologies, standardized  baselines and/or other methodological regulatory documents resulting from the  changes referred to in subparagraphs (a)–(f) above, including change to or addition  of other methodologies, other standardized baselines and/or other methodological  regulatory documents, or application of a baseline scenario that is more  appropriate as a result of the proposed or actual modifications to the project;  (j) Voluntarily updating the applied methodologies or the other applied methodological  regulatory documents to a later valid version, or voluntarily changing to other  methodologies, provided all requirements in the updated/changed methodologies  and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are met. 106. The activity participants shall report the impacts of the proposed or actual changes to the  registered A6.4 project on the following in the revised PDD:  (a) The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents with which the project has been registered; 18 Examples include:  (a) A landfill gas capture and electricity generation activity using three electricity generating units adds  an additional electricity generating unit without altering the quantity of landfill gas extracted (i.e. the  capacity of the landfill gas extraction system remained the same);  (b) Addition of a back-up electricity generating source to supply electricity during exigencies when the  project fails to meet the demand or is not available due to operational reasons. 19 Examples include a project disseminating lamps with useful life of two years changing to distribute lamps  with useful life of seven years. 20 Examples include changing the mode of utilization of recovered methane from a landfill, such as shifting  from flaring to heat generation or from heat generation to electricity generation.  25 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (b) The project boundary and any implications on the inclusion or exclusion of  emissions sources and leakage emissions;  (c) Compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied  standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory  documents;  (d) The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring of the project compared  with the requirements contained in the registered monitoring plan;  (e) The additionality of the project;  (f) The compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool. 107. The following applies if the proposed or actual changes affect the additionality of the  registered A6.4 project, as referred to in paragraph 106(e) above:  (a) For changes referred to in paragraph 105(c) above, additionality shall be  reassessed based on data and information that were available at the start date of  the A6.4 project, and subject to validation by a DOE through a post-registration  change process either prior to or as part of the first verification of emission  reductions or net removals;  (b) For all other changes, the demonstration of the impacts of the changes on the  additionality shall be based on the original input data for all other elements other  than the changes.21 108. If the proposed or actual changes referred to in paragraph 105(a)–(j) above affect the  identification, assessment or monitoring of environmental, social or sustainable  development impacts, the activity participants shall reassess, based on paragraph 106(f)  above, the impact caused by the changes by providing a revised version of the A6.4  Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and  social management plan form (if applicable) and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact  form. These revised forms shall be subject to validation by a DOE prior to or as part of the  first verification of emission reductions or net removals. 109. Where the activity participants cannot demonstrate compliance with the requirements of  the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied  methodological regulatory documents with which the A6.4 project has been registered, the  activity participants shall:  (a) Revise the PDD, applying:  (i) A later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents; or  (ii) Other methodologies, other standardized baselines or other methodological  regulatory documents that are applicable to the project; and  (b) Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the newly applied  methodologies, the newly applied standardized baselines and the other applied  methodological regulatory documents in the revised PDD. 21 Ifa proposed or actual modification adversely impacts the additionality of the project, subsequent  requests for issuance of A6.4ERs based on such modifications will be rejected.  26 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 7.3.4.

If an A6.4 project, after its registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism, is also registered  under, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional, national,  subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the activity participants shall  obtain a confirmation of such registration or coverage from the other scheme. 7.4. Reversals related actions for projects involving removals and emission  reductions projects with reversal risks 111. In case of occurrence of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that  could potentially lead to a reversal, activity participants shall prepare a preliminary  assessment report in order to determine whether the observed event has resulted in an  actual reversal. The report shall contain the following information:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the  monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed; 112. If the observed event is an ongoing event, the preliminary assessment report shall be  prepared after the event has ended or has been fully contained. 113. The preliminary assessment report shall conclude, on the basis of transparent and  verifiable evidence, whether the observed event did or did not result in actual reversals. 114. If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report or if the  preliminary assessment concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual  reversal, the activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report based on the monitoring  plan contained in the PDD and submit it to a DOE for verification. The monitoring report  shall include:  (a) A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the  monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;  (c) Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a  summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;  (d) Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could  have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions, along with a  summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period  covered by the monitoring report;  (e) Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent  with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered PDD;  (f) Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been  assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the  registered PDD.  27 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 115. Following the submission of the monitoring report referred in paragraph 114 above, activity  participants shall:  (a) Review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk rating of  the activity as necessary, which shall include the development of plans to prevent  further releases of GHGs through a post-registration change;  (b) Review the compliance with the requirements and safeguards contained in the  A6.4 SD Tool, taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts  caused by the reversal and develop plans to prevent the recurrence of such  negative environmental and social impacts;  (c) Review and update the monitoring plan in case additional risk factors are identified  following a reversal that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the  monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan. 8. Implementation and monitoring 8.1. General requirements 116. The activity participants shall implement and operate the registered A6.4 project in  accordance with the description provided in the registered PDD, including all physical  features. 117. The activity participants shall continuously monitor the registered A6.4 project and its GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals in accordance with the registered monitoring  plan. 118. The activity participants shall describe the implementation of the registered A6.4 project  and the monitored GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals in monitoring reports  to provide an understanding of how the implementation and monitoring were conducted. 119. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  monitoring reports shall be based on the monitoring plan contained in the latest version of  the PDD and shall include the elements specified in paragraph 114 above. 120. The activity participants shall report monitoring results in monitoring reports, including the  relevant forms of the A6.4 SD Tool, in the following manner:  (a) Each monitoring report shall cover the entire duration of a monitoring period without  any gaps. If monitoring did not occur during any part of the monitoring period due  to force majeure circumstances or for other reasons the issuance of A6.4 ERs is  not sought, the monitoring report shall clearly indicate such period and explain the  circumstances;  (b) The first monitoring period shall start from the start of the crediting period as  specified in the registered PDD. If actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG  removals have not occurred by the start of the crediting period, the monitoring  report for the first monitoring period shall report zero GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals for the period until they occur;  (c) If negative GHG emission reductions (i.e., net GHG emissions) have occured  during a monitoring period, such negative values shall be clearly indicated and  28 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  deducted from the total amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals  for that monitoring period;  (d) The monitored amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals shall be  presented by year of occurrence in monitoring reports;  (e) The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level environmental and social indicators  shall be presented using the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form of the A6.4 SD Tool, if applicable;  (f) The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level sustainable development indicators  shall be presented using the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form of the  A6.4 SD Tool;  (g) Monitoring reports shall be prepared chronologically and with no gaps between two  successive monitoring periods;  (h) Monitoring results for different crediting periods shall be documented in separate  monitoring reports. 121. Notwithstanding paragraphs 120(e) and 120(f) above, for projects that have successfully  transitioned from the CDM and prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits  description report” in accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool”  developed under the CDM at the time of transition, the monitoring report shall include the  outcome of monitoring of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on  the document describing how the activity participant intends to monitor sustainable  development co-benefits of the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring  results in accordance with the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4  mechanism”. 122. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the  monitoring reports shall be submitted within the frequency specified by the applied  methodologies or in shorter intervals, or following the observation of an event of GHG  release that could potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in section 7.4 above. 123. All monitoring, verifications and requests for issuance of A6.4ERs in respect of GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by A6.4 projects shall be calculated  using the GWPs contained in Appendix 1 in accordance with section 5.2 above. 124. The activity participants shall maintain all monitoring results for the registered A6.4 project  in accordance with the monitoring management system described in the registered  monitoring plan as per paragraph 69 above. 8.2.

When describing the implementation and monitoring of the registered A6.4 project, activity  participants shall provide, inter alia, the following information:  (a) The title and UNFCCC reference number of the project;  (b) Names of the activity participants involved;  (c) Location of the project;  29 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (d) Titles, versions and UNFCCC reference numbers of the applied methodologies  and, where applicable, the applied standardized baselines, including any other  methodologies or methodological tools to which the applied methodologies refer;  (e) The type, start date and duration of the crediting period;  (f) The monitoring period sequence number and dates of coverage;  (g) The version number of the PDD applicable to the monitoring period. 8.3. Avoidance of double issuance 126. The activity participants shall confirm that the reported GHG emission reductions or net  GHG removals for which they intend to request issuance of A6.4ERs do not overlap with  any of the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for which they have already  requested or intend to request credits under any other international, regional, national,  subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme. The activity participants shall  further acknowledge that if such double issuance is detected, the DOE will issue a  negative verification opinion, the request for issuance will be rejected by the Supervisory  Body, or the double issuance amounts will be deducted from future issuance of A6.4ERs  for the same A6.4 project if the requested A6.4ERs have already been issued. 127. If the A6.4 project is also registered under, or covered by a programme, under any other  international, regional, national subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting  scheme prior to the request for issuance, the activity participants shall also obtain a  confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have not been or will not be  credited under such other crediting scheme. 8.4. Description of implemented registered project 128. The activity participants shall provide a description of the implemented registered A6.4  project including:  (a) A description of the installed technologies, technical processes and equipment;  (b) Information on the implementation and actual operation of the project, including  relevant dates (e.g., construction, commissioning, start of operation). For a project  that consists of more than one site, the activity participants shall describe the status  of implementation and start date of operation for each site. For a project with  phased implementation, the activity participants shall indicate the progress of the  project achieved in each phase. 129. The activity participants shall indicate whether there are any temporary deviations from  the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized  baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents, in accordance with  section 7.3.2 above, or if there are any permanent changes to the registered A6.4 project  or the registered monitoring plan, in accordance with section 7.3.3 above (hereinafter  referred to as post-registration changes). For post-registration changes that have been  approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall indicate the dates of  approval.  30 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 8.5. Description of monitoring system 130. The activity participants shall describe the monitoring system, and provide diagrams  (graphical schemes) showing all relevant monitoring points. This description may include  data collection procedures (information flow including data generation, aggregation,  recording, calculations and reporting), organizational structure, roles and responsibilities  of personnel, and emergency procedures for the monitoring system. 8.6. Data and parameters 131. The activity participants shall provide all parameters used to calculate the baseline, BAU,  project and leakage GHG emissions, or the baseline and actual net GHG removals, as  well as other relevant parameters for the monitoring period as required by the registered  monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the  other applied methodological regulatory documents. The activity participants shall provide  information on how these data and parameters were monitored. 132. For each parameter, the activity participants shall:  (a) Provide the values of the monitored parameter necessary for calculating GHG  emission reductions or net GHG removals. Where data are continuously  measured, they shall be presented using an appropriate time interval. For any  default value that is not fixed at the time of registration of the A6.4 project, the most  recent value shall be applied;  (b) Describe the equipment used to monitor each parameter, including details on  accuracy class and calibration information (frequency, date of calibration and  validity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan;  (c) Describe how the parameter is measured/calculated including the measurement  and recording frequency;  (d) Provide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g., logbooks, daily records, surveys);  (e) Provide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant;  (f) Describe the QA/QC procedures applied, if applicable, as per the registered  monitoring plan;  (g) Provide information on appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values and any  other relevant reference values. 133. If monitored data and parameters are determined through a sampling approach, the  activity participants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance  with the sampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan. 134. For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing  a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-ante determination,  or that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring a determination of these  values ex-ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of the  submission of the request for registration for this purpose, the activity participants shall  apply the same version of the standardized baseline monitoring until the end of the first  crediting period.  31 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 135. For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing  a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-post determination  where there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of registration, the  activity participants may switch to the ex-ante determination, at any time during the first  crediting period, by applying an applicable standardized baseline that becomes available  after the registration and is valid at the time of the switch, and apply the same version of  the standardized baseline for the purpose of monitoring for the remainder of the same  crediting period. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline shall undergo the  post-registration change approval process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,  and the standardized baseline shall be valid at the time of the submission of the post-  registration change approval request. 136. For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing  a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating  baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals, if the selected crediting period type is  renewable, the activity participants shall, at each renewal of the crediting period, choose  the ex-ante or ex-post determination of parameter values, unless otherwise required by  the applied methodology or methodological tool, and shall follow the same rules in terms  of the use and validity of standardized baselines as in paragraphs 134 and 135 above. 137. Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan  form, if applicable, and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form containing all  parameters used to monitor the environmental and social impacts and the sustainable  development impacts and explaining how any negative environmental and social impacts  have been assessed, mitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in  the registered PDD. 138. If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the  DOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements  and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants  may request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4  SD Tool forms accordingly. 139. For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the  monitoring report as part of the investment analysis. 8.7. Calculation of emission reductions or net removals 140. The activity participants shall identify the formulae used by the registered A6.4 project for  the monitoring period and provide the calculations of the following:  (a) Baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals;  (b) Project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals;  (c) Leakage GHG emissions;  (d) GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals. 141. Where projects involving removals also result in emission reductions, the accounting of  removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the monitoring report in  accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity.  32 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 142. The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or  net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project with their estimates provided  in the registered PDD. 143. For any registered A6.4 project, the activity participants shall explain the cause of any  increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the  monitoring period (e.g., higher water availability, higher plant load factor), including all  information (i.e., data and/or parameters) that is different from what is stated in the  registered PDD. 9. Renewal of crediting period 144. The crediting period of a registered A6.4 project may be renewed if the host Party has  approved the renewal when approving the project prior to its registration in accordance  with the activity cycle procedure. 145. To support a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project, the  activity participants shall, using the valid version of the applicable PDD form, update the  sections of the PDD of the project relating to:  (a) The baseline emissions, including updating the downward adjustment as per  paragraphs 55 and 56 above;  (b) The BAU scenario and emissions, and the difference between the baseline  emissions and BAU emissions as annual and total amounts with respect to the  crediting period to be renewed;  (c) The additionality by updating the regulatory analysis;  (d) The estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable);  (e) The monitoring plan (if applicable);  (f) The A6.4 SD Tool forms;  (g) The risk assessment and monitoring plan for projects involving removals and for  emission reduction projects with reversal risks;  (h) The crediting period. 146. When updating the PDD, activity participants shall apply methodologies in one of the  following manners:  (a) The activity participants shall use the valid version of the methodologies and  methodological tools applied in the registered PDD; that is, either the latest version  at the time of the submission of the request for renewal or the previous version if  the submission of the request for renewal is still within the grace period of the  previous version for use;22  (b) If any of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD was withdrawn after the  registration of the project and was replaced by consolidated methodologies, the  activity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies; 22 Referredto in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and  methodological tools”.  33 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (c) If the project no longer meets the applicability conditions of the methodologies or  methodological tools mentioned in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above due to the  methodologies or methodological tools revisions or due to an update of the project  baseline, the activity participants shall either:  (i) Select other applicable approved methodologies; or  (ii) Request, either through the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the  crediting period or by the activity participants, a clarification as to whether a  deviation from the valid version of the methodologies (including consolidated  methodologies thereof) or the methodological tools applied in the registered  PDD, or from any other selected methodologies, or any other methodological  tools applied in accordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable.  This clarification shall be made under the clarification process outlined in the  “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of baseline and  monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”. 147. In updating the PDD of the registered A6.4 project in accordance with paragraphs 145 and  146 above, the activity participants shall consider the application of an approved  standardized baseline to the project as follows:  (a) The activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved standardized  baseline if:  (i) The standardized baseline is applied in the registered PDD and the valid  version of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the project and to  the methodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 146 above; or  (ii) The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD but the valid  version of the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory23 is  applicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with  paragraph 146 above. However, if the submission of the request for renewal  of the crediting period is made within 240 days after the standardized  baseline became valid, the activity participants may update the PDD without  selecting the standardized baseline.  (b) If the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD is  no longer applicable to the project and/or to the valid version of the methodologies  applied in the registered PDD due to a revision of the standardized baseline after  the registration of the project, the activity participants shall:  (i) Select another applicable approved standardized baseline; or  (ii) Use only the valid version of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD  that are still applicable to the project and that can be used independently for  estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals without using the  standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD;  (c) The activity participants may use the valid version of an applicable approved  standardized baseline if:  (i) The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD; and 23 For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 11.  34 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0  (ii) The standardized baseline does not require its mandatory selection but is  applicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with  paragraph 146 above. 148. The activity participants shall demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update  in accordance with paragraphs 149−150 below. 149. To demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update, the activity participants  shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies, standardized  baselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents. 150. If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline were determined ex-  ante and were not monitored during the crediting period and are no longer valid, the activity  participants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be  provided by the Supervisory Body. 151. The results of the process described in paragraphs 145–150 above shall be used to define  a new version of the PDD. 152. The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up to date. 153. If the activity participants plan to make, or have already made, a post-registration change  to the project design effective from the start date of the new crediting period, they shall  clearly indicate this change in the new version of the PDD, distinguishing it from other  updates of information due to renewal of the crediting period. 10. Post-crediting monitoring and reporting 154. For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks,  activity participants shall continue monitoring the project after the end of the last active  crediting period to:  (a) Assess whether any reversals have occurred;  (b) Quantify the amount of reversals; and  (c) Confirm the continued storage of the GHGs. 155. Activity participants may terminate the post-crediting monitoring, subject to approval by  the Supervisory Body, if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable  information, that:  (a) The stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or  (b) The potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of  the relevant section of the removals standard (i.e., Remediation of reversals). 11. Voluntary deregistration of project 156. The activity participants may request the secretariat to deregister an A6.4 project in  accordance with the activity cycle procedure at any time after the registration of the project. 157. An A6.4 project that has been deregistered may not be reregistered as an A6.4 project or  included as a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA.  35 of 39  A6.4-STAN-AC-002 Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects Version 02.0 Appendix 1.

Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)  for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the  Article 6.4 mechanism).1 Chapter XI.A of the RMPs contains provisions that allow  transition of project activities and programmes of activities (PoAs) registered under the  clean development mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol or listed as  provisional as per the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Board of the CDM 2  (hereinafter referred to as provisional requests) to the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated key conditions and processes for such  transition.3 At the same session, the CMA also requested4 the Supervisory Body to  facilitate the tasks related to the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism  by:  (a) Developing and operationalizing a procedure for requesting transition, which  includes relevant forms, by no later than June 2023;  (b) Developing and operationalizing the transition process and reporting back to the  CMA at its fifth session. 3. The CMA, at its sixth session,5 decided that afforestation and reforestation project  activities and programmes of activities registered under the CDM may transition to the  Article 6.4 mechanism and be registered as Article 6.4 activities. The CMA also elaborated  key conditions for such a transition. 4. Pursuant to its mandate from the CMA to operationalize the transition process, the  Supervisory Body has adopted the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article  6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) as contained in this document  and the “Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter  referred to as the transition procedure) and relevant forms. 5. The Supervisory Body at its 16th meeting agreed to provisions on avoidance of double  issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities.

The activity type of a CDM project activity, or PoA and the CPAs therein, that may  transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism shall be among those indicated publicly by the host  Party to the Supervisory Body as it would consider approving pursuant to paragraph 26(e)  of the RMPs. 6.2. Methodology 22. A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism may continue to apply the currently applied CDM methodology until the earlier  of the end of the current crediting period or PoA period as applicable, or 31 December  2025. After that date, it shall apply an Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter  referred to as mechanism methodology). 23. For a CDM project activity or CPA with the fixed crediting period type, if the replacement  of the currently applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology is due before  the end of the current crediting period under the Article 6.4 mechanism, such replacement  shall be made through the post-registration change process applicable to any new A6.4  activities. 24. Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 22 above, if the currently applied CDM  methodology does not meet the methodological requirements that may be specified by the  host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, it shall be replaced with a  mechanism methodology. 25. A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, may voluntarily replace the currently  applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology at transition. Also, they may  be required to do so in accordance with paragraph 24 above. In these cases, the project  design document, or PoA design document and CPA design documents, shall be revised  by the project participant, validated by a designated operational entity, and approved by  the Supervisory Body in accordance with the transition procedure. 26. For a transitioning CDM PoA,:  (a) If the PoA continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition  in accordance with paragraph 22 above, no new CPA may be included in the PoA  until the PoA period is renewed under the Article 6.4 mechanism applying a  mechanism methodology;  (b) The mandatory replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a  mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 24 above shall be made to both  the PoA and the CPAs therein at transition;  (c) If the voluntary replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a  mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 25 above takes place at the PoA  level at transition, any new CPAs that may be included after the transition shall  apply the mechanism methodology, while the existing CPAs may choose to  continue applying the currently applied CDM methodology until the earlier of the  end of their respective current crediting periods or 31 December 2025, or switch to  the mechanism methodology at transition;  7 of 14  A6.4-STAN-AC-001 Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 04.0  (d) If the voluntary replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a  mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 25 above takes place for any of  the existing CPAs at transition, such voluntary replacement shall also take place  at the PoA level at transition. 27. A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism are in compliance with the requirement of paragraph 31(a) of the RMPs  regarding additionality of their mitigation of GHG emissions as long as they continue to  apply the CDM methodology in accordance with paragraph 22 above. If the CDM  methodology is replaced with a mechanism methodology mandatorily or voluntarily,  additionality shall be demonstrated in accordance with the relevant requirements  applicable to any new A6.4 activities. 28. In addition to the provisions in paragraph 27 above afforestation and reforestation CDM  project activities, or PoAs and CPAs therein that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism shall comply with the applicable requirements for activities involving removals  under the mechanism, as contained in the Supervisory Body “Standard: Requirements for  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. 29. CDM A/R projects, PoAs and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4  mechanism shall comply with the following elements of the “Standard: Requirements for  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”:  (a) Identification of risk of reversals: This shall include identification and justification of  the risks of reversals that may be attributed to the A/R CDM project activity, or A/R  CDM PoA and A/R CPAs therein, aligned with the provisions of the “Standard:  Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”  and other applied methodological regulatory documents approved by the  Supervisory Body. The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to:  (i) Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity  costs;  (ii) Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal  risks, acts of terrorism, crime, and war;  (iii) Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and  geological faults and fractures;  (iv) Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks.  (b) Reversal risk assessment: This assessment shall be undertaken in accordance  with the provisions of the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals  under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applied methodological regulatory  documents approved by the Supervisory Body. The assessment shall calculate an  overall percentage-based risk rating that accounts for both avoidable and  unavoidable reversals, taking into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude,  likelihood, and duration of the risks;  (c) Reversal risk mitigation plan: If a risk of non-permanence is identified, the project  participants shall develop and implement a risk mitigation plan, aligned with the  corresponding eligibility criteria, to address any risks identified through the reversal  risk assessment. This plan shall follow the relevant provisions of the “Standard:  Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”  8 of 14  A6.4-STAN-AC-001 Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism Version 04.0  and other applied methodological regulatory documents approved by the  Supervisory Body;  (d) Remediation of reversals: The project participants shall describe the measures to  be implemented to remediate reversals aligned with the corresponding eligibility  criteria, including proactive measures to mitigate reversal risks and avoid  reversals, as per the requirements of the “Standard: Requirements for activities  involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applied  methodological regulatory documents approved by the Supervisory Body;  (e) Post-crediting period monitoring plan: The project participants shall describe the  monitoring to be conducted after the end of the last active crediting period of the  A/R CDM project activity, or A/R CDM PoA and A/R CPAs therein, to assess  whether any reversals have occurred. This monitoring shall be in accordance with  the requirements of the selected methodology and/or standardized baseline, the  provisions of the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under  the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applied methodological regulatory  documents approved by the Supervisory Body. 6.3.

Introduction 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to  ensure transparency of decision-making and make publicly available its decision-making  framework and decisions, including standards, procedures, and related documents. 2. The Supervisory Body plays a crucial role in developing and overseeing the regulatory  framework that guides the Article 6.4 mechanism’s implementation. In addition to being  transparent, the regulatory documents must be consistent and legally sound to support  the integrity of the carbon markets and emissions reductions under the Article 6.4  mechanism. 3. The CMA, at its sixth session, requested the Supervisory Body to engage, in consultation  with interested stakeholders, further independent scientific and technical expertise and  local communities, and include the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous  Peoples, as relevant, to support its work, including through its expert panels, to review  proposals as necessary and receive independent scientific and technical advice. It further  requested the Supervisory Body to consider relevant international environmental  agreements when carrying out its work, including when implementing the “Standard:  Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and  assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”,1 the “Standard: Requirements for  activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”2 and the “Article 6.4  sustainable development tool”. 3 It also requested the Supervisory Body, while ensuring  ongoing continuous improvements to reflect the best available science, to strive to ensure  regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to its adopted standards,  tools and procedures. 4. At its tenth meeting, the Supervisory Body requested the secretariat to undertake an initial  structured legal and editorial review of the regulations and procedures approved by the  Supervisory Body to ensure consistency among the regulations, including with regard to  its Rules of Procedure, and to undertake the first review in 2024 with a view to prepare  relevant proposals for consideration by the Supervisory Body in 2025. In addition, to  facilitate subsequent reviews of regulations, the Supervisory Body requested the  secretariat to establish a periodic structured legal and editorial review system of its  regulations to, among others, ensure transparency and consistency among the  regulations, as well as address any matters brought forward by the Supervisory Body for  consideration in this regard. 2. Scope, applicability, and entry into force 2.1. Scope 5. The purpose of this document is to establish the periodic structured legal and editorial  review system of the Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents governing the Article 6.4 1 Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf. 2 Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf. 3 Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-TOOL-AC-001.pdf.  3 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the periodic review system) and set out its key  components and operational framework. This includes defining the focus of the review,  establishing the frequency and timelines for conducting the reviews, clarifying key roles  and responsibilities of involved actors, and outlining the related decision-making process. 2.2. Applicability 6. This document shall be applicable for the periodic review of all regulatory documents  approved by the Supervisory Body. 2.3. Entry into force 7. This document enters into force on 16 May 2025. 3. Definitions 8. The following definitions of terms are used in this document:  (a) “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;  (b) “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action  is recommended as particularly suitable;  (c) “May” is used to indicate what is permitted. 4. Normative references 9. This procedure should be read in conjunction with the “Decision and documentation  framework”.4 In line with that framework, the Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of  the Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully  accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory Body has authority over and provides guidance  to the activities and processes of the Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the  Supervisory Body shall elaborate upon and be consistent with the CMA decisions. 10. Regulatory decisions of the Supervisory Body relate to the adoption of, or revision to the  Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements developed under its direction. These  decisions are reflected in the adoption of, or revision to, standards (including policy  standards, methodologies, and standardized baselines), procedures, tools (including  policy and methodological tools), guidelines and clarifications (including policy and  methodological clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the  Supervisory Body.5 11.

While  this framework includes provisions for document control and revision, it does not specifically establish a  formal legal and editorial review process. 5 Ibid.  4 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  regulatory decisions is published on the Article 6.4 mechanism Supervisory Body section  of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website.6 5. Periodic review system 12. Based on the initial review experience and lessons learned, a periodic review system is  hereby established, to ensure transparency and consistency among the regulations,  ensure continued compliance with CMA guidance, and address any matters brought  forward by the Supervisory Body for consideration in this regard. 13. To ensure transparency, the periodic review system shall envisage a formal process for  conducting the periodic reviews, based on clearly defined criteria for legal and editorial  assessments, and implemented according to a structured timeline. Stakeholder feedback  and comments provided in accordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with  stakeholders”7 shall be considered, as relevant. In addition, the secretariat shall provide  the Supervisory Body regular updates on the progress and status of each review, including  key findings and any proposed regulatory amendments. Final approved changes and  review outcomes shall be made available through the UNFCCC website. 14. Periodic reviews shall be undertaken by the secretariat once approved by the Supervisory  Body, and may be triggered by, inter alia:  (a) Scheduled intervals;  (b) New CMA guidance that requires updates to the Article 6.4 mechanism's  operations;  (c) Identification by the Supervisory Body of issues that need to be addressed;  (d) Identification of gaps or weaknesses discovered through implementation  experience or stakeholder feedback; and  (e) Findings from other review processes or other relevant developments that may  necessitate adjustments to the Article 6.4 mechanism's operations. 5.1. Objectives 15. The periodic review system aims to achieve the following objectives:  (a) Establish a structured process for the periodic legal and editorial reviews  and the refinement of the Supervisory Body's regulatory documents. This  process aims to identify issues to consider in relation to relevant international  environmental agreements, relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the  Supervisory Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”.  (b) Improve transparency, legal clarity, and coherence across regulatory  documents to support the smooth operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 6  See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-  body/rules-and-regulations. The review of individual methodologies, methodological tools, standardized  baselines, which are under the purview of the Methodology Expert Panel (MEP), are not within the  scope of the periodic legal and editorial review. 7 A6.4-PROC-GOV-007 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-007.pdf.  5 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  As the mechanism operates within a global climate regime, transparency is crucial  for building trust among Parties, private sector actors, and civil society. Regular  reviews will help identify and correct inconsistencies or ambiguities, ensuring  internal coherence and harmonization with relevant frameworks;  (c) Enhance readability and clarity of the regulations for both technical and non-  technical audiences, ensuring transparent communication of regulatory  requirements. This will ensure that the legal language used is robust, clear, and  aligned with evolving international legal standards and practices, thereby  improving accessibility for all stakeholders;  (d) Support continuous improvement and adaptability by establishing practices for  refining the regulatory framework based on lessons learned, stakeholder feedback,  regulatory developments, and emerging needs;  (e) Promote regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to the  adopted standards, tools and procedures, while ensuring ongoing continuous  improvements;  (f) Address any issues brought forward by the Supervisory Body or  stakeholders, which require legal or editorial clarification. These include providing  a formalized process to address specific legal or operational issues encountered  by the Supervisory Body promptly, ensuring the regulatory framework remains  clear and effective;  (g) Enable meaningful and broad-based stakeholder input. Incorporate in  accordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with stakeholders”, input  from Parties, non-Party stakeholders, and technical experts, consultations with  local communities including the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous  Peoples, as relevant, to support its work. This will foster a transparent, inclusive,  and participatory approach to regulatory governance, and will help enhance the  credibility of the Supervisory Body and overall trust in the Article 6.4 mechanism. 5.2. Focus of the periodic review 16. The periodic review system shall focus on two main aspects:  (a) Legal assessment: Ensuring the regulatory documents consistency with the Paris  Agreement, and relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the Supervisory  Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”; as well as legal  coherence, consistency and clarity.  (b) Editorial assessment: Ensuring that the regulatory documents are clear, concise,  and free from ambiguity or inconsistency in language. 5.2.1. Legal assessment process 17. The legal assessment shall focus on ensuring the regulatory documents are legally sound,  and coherent. It shall support legal certainty, enforceability, and consistency across the  documentation and shall aim to ensure:  (a) Compliance with CMA guidance and internal decisions and instruments:  6 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  (i) Verify that each regulatory document is in line with relevant CMA guidance,  the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Body, and the “Decision and  documentation framework”.  (b) Alignment with applicable international law and environmental agreements:  (i) Check alignment of the regulatory documents with international treaties or  agreements, when particularly applicable.  (c) Legal coherence and consistency:  (i) Ensure that the regulatory documents are coherent with CMA guidance, the  rules of procedure of the Supervisory Body, and the “Decision and  documentation framework”, while ensuring that the procedures and  standards are clearly distinct;  (ii) Identify interdependencies and linkages, highlighting other documents that  may require concurrent or subsequent revisions as a result of a revision that  is being undertaken;  (iii) Cross-reference related documents to ensure alignment and consistency;  (iv) Identify and recommend the removal of redundant or duplicative provisions  where identified.  (d) Legal clarity:  (i) Check whether the legal provisions are clearly drafted, avoiding unnecessary  legal jargon;  (ii) Ensure consistent use of legal terms and definitions across all regulatory  documents.  (e) Compliance and enforcement provisions:  (i) Identify any gaps or missing elements that could undermine the effectiveness  or enforceability of the regulatory documents. 5.2.2. Editorial assessment process 18. The editorial assessment shall focus on enhancing clarity, coherence, and accessibility for  all stakeholders, both technical and non-technical audiences. The process shall include:  (a) Clarity and readability:  (i) Ensure the language used is clear, precise, and accessible to both technical  and non-technical audiences;  (ii) Simplify complex provisions where possible, without compromising legal or  technical accuracy.  (b) Consistency of terminology:  (i) Verify consistent use of key terms and concepts throughout the regulatory  documents;  7 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  (ii) Cross-check definitions to ensure they are used correctly and align with  existing UNFCCC or Paris Agreement texts, as well as CMA guidance, the  rules of procedure of the Supervisory Body, and the “Decision and  documentation framework”.  (c) Structure and formatting:  (i) Review the structure of the regulatory documents to ensure they follow a  logical progression and flow;  (ii) Ensure proper use of headings, sections, and sub-sections to make the  document easily navigable;  (iii) Verify accuracy and currency of cross-references between sections.  (d) Language harmonization:  (i) Check for consistency in style and tone across the document, ensuring  adherence to UNFCCC drafting guidelines or style guides;  (ii) Ensure that technical language and regulatory instructions are harmonized  to avoid confusion among different stakeholders.  (e) Grammar and style:  (i) Correct grammatical errors, improve sentence structure, and ensure  adherence to a consistent editorial style guide. 5.3. Periodic review cycles and timelines 19. The periodic review system shall follow structured cycles, designed to ensure timely and  efficient updates to the Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents. 20. The cycles for conducting the periodic reviews shall be as follows:  (a) Regular reviews: shall be undertaken on an ongoing basis, as necessary, before  each Supervisory Body document is adopted or revised, and whenever there is a  need to address related urgent issues or regulatory gaps that arise;  (b) Recurring reviews: shall be undertaken to ensure systematic updates reflecting  evolving legal developments, and to maintain consistency across regulatory  documents. These reviews should be typically scheduled every 5 years; however,  they may be conducted at an earlier or later time if, and only when, significant  triggers arise such as regulatory changes or stakeholder feedback identifying  substantial deficiencies across multiple existing documents. 21. Each recurring review shall typically follow a 6-12-month timeline, comprising the following  phases:  (a) Pre-review preparation (1-3 months) – Assembly of the review team, planning of  the activities, and where applicable, outreach to stakeholders;  (b) Review and analysis (3-6 months) - Conducting legal and editorial assessments  of regulatory documents and drafting proposed amendments;  8 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  (c) Approval and publication (2-3 months) - Submission of proposed revisions to the  Supervisory Body for consideration and approval, as relevant, followed by public  dissemination of the updated documents. 6. Operational framework 6.1. Key roles and responsibilities 22. Each recurring review shall be undertaken once approved by the Supervisory Body and  coordinated by the secretariat which shall oversee the overall planning, implementation,  and reporting of the review process. 23. The reviews shall be conducted by a legal and editorial review team composed of legal  specialists, technical specialists and editors, who could be either secretariat staff or  external experts, with experience in international climate agreements and regulatory  frameworks. 6.2. Decision making process 24. The decision-making process for the periodic reviews will be as follows:  (a) Coordination by the secretariat: The secretariat shall serve as the coordinating  body for both recurring and regular reviews. For recurring reviews, it shall, subject  to the approval of the Supervisory Body, determine the documents to be reviewed,  and establish the relevant review teams;  (b) Formulating proposals: Once the review is completed and revisions are made,  the secretariat shall prepare a summary of key findings and proposed changes to  the regulatory documents, and specify whether each proposed change is either:  (i) Substantive, involving changes to the document’s content; or  (ii) Corrective or editorial, entailing (primarily minor changes that do not affect or  alter the core meaning of the document;  (c) Submission to the Supervisory Body: The proposed changes shall be submitted  to the Supervisory Body for its consideration and approval, as relevant, and in  accordance with the “Decision and documentation framework”. The Supervisory  Body may request further clarifications or revisions prior to granting final approval;  (d) Regular reporting: The secretariat shall provide regular updates to the  Supervisory Body on the progress and status of the periodic reviews. These  updates shall include key findings, stakeholder feedback, and proposed regulatory  amendments;  (e) Public access: The revised document incorporating the changes shall be  published and made available on the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the  UNFCCC website.  -----  9 of 10  A6.4-PROC-GOV-008 Procedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents Version 01.0  Document information  Version Date Description  01.0 16 May 2025 SBM 016, Annex 1.

Introduction 1.1. Background 1. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism  established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to  ensure transparency of decision-making and make publicly available its decision-making  framework and decisions, including standards, procedures and related documents.1 2. This document addresses the mandate of the CMA. It will be updated, as required, should  changes to the classes of decisions and types of documents be requested by the  Supervisory Body. 1.2. Objective 3. The objectives of this document are to:  (a) Ensure transparency, consistency and clarity within the body of decisions and  documents issued by the Supervisory Body;  (b) Contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory management under the  Supervisory Body and assist stakeholders in locating requirements of the Article  6.4 mechanism in a timely and efficient manner;  (c) Facilitate the successful operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism. 2. Scope 4. This document describes:  (a) The hierarchical relationship between decisions taken by the CMA and decisions  of the Supervisory Body;  (b) The different classes of decisions taken by the Supervisory Body;  (c) The different document types containing these decisions;  (d) The hierarchical relationship between Supervisory Body document types;  (e) The relationship between Supervisory Body decision classes and document types;  (f) The control and limitation of documents issued by the Supervisory Body. 1 See decision 3/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 21 contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1  available at: https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.  3 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0 3. Decision hierarchy between the CMA and the Supervisory  Body 5. The CMA is the ultimate decision-making body of the Article 6.4 mechanism. The CMA  has authority over and provides guidance to the Supervisory Body through the adoption  of decisions, which are published in reports of the CMA. The decisions of the CMA outline  formal expectations with respect to the Article 6.4 mechanism. They set direction and  establish precedents which serve as reference for future decision-making and the basis  for operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism. CMA decisions are treated as mandatory  requirements or rules intended to ensure the successful implementation of the Paris  Agreement.2 6. The Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of the Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under  the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory  Body has authority over and provides guidance to the activities and processes of the  Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the Supervisory Body elaborate upon and  must be consistent with decisions of the CMA. 7. Decisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded in the meeting reports of the Supervisory  Body and their accompanying annexes, which together form the official record of the  proceedings of the Supervisory Body meetings. The authoritative set of documents  containing regulatory decisions is published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website. 4. Supervisory Body decision classes 8. Taking into account both the rule-making and rule-enforcing roles of the Supervisory Body,  decisions of the Supervisory Body are divided into three classes:  (a) Regulatory decisions: relate to the adoption of, or revision to, the Article 6.4  mechanism rules and requirements developed under the direction of the  Supervisory Body, to be followed by the Supervisory Body, its support structure  and stakeholders.3 Regulatory decisions are reflected in the adoption of, or  revisions to, standards (including policy standards, methodologies and  standardized baselines), procedures, tools (including policy and methodological  tools), guidelines and clarifications (including policy and methodological  clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the  Supervisory Body; 2 The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196  Parties at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris, on 12 December and entered  into force on 4 November 2016. Information on the Paris Agreement, including the text of the agreement,  is available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement. 3 ‘Support structure’ refers to, for example, experts, supporting bodies established by the Supervisory  Body and/or the secretariat. ‘Stakeholder’ refers to the entities, groups, fora, communities or individuals  that have a role in the implementation of the functions of the Supervisory Body or that may affect or be  directly affected by the recommendations and actions of the Supervisory Body .  4 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  (b) Rulings: relate to the determination of whether the actions of participants of an  activity4 under the Article 6.4 mechanism, applicant entities (AEs), or designated  operational entities (DOEs) are in compliance with the Article 6.4 mechanism rules  and requirements. Rulings of the Supervisory Body are published in the main body  of the meeting reports of the Supervisory Body and/or as separate documents;  (c) Operational decisions: relate to the functioning of the Supervisory Body and its  support structure (for example, experts, supporting bodies and secretariat) and  include decisions on finance; administration; programmes of work; internal  operating procedures; and the establishment of supporting bodies. Operational  decisions are either published within the main body of the meeting reports of the  Supervisory Body or reflected in the adoption of, or revision to, internal  standards, procedures and guidelines, or in the publishing of information notes.

Document types 9. The body of documents developed under the direction of the Supervisory Body that serve  to operationalize the Article 6.4 mechanism, includes:  (a) Standards: Standards are designed to achieve a uniform approach to compliance  with the rules, modalities and procedures for the Article 6.4 mechanism (RMP). A  standard describes mandatory levels of performance and/or provides mandatory 4 The activity may be a project, programme of activities or other type of activity approved by the  Supervisory Body, as paragraph 31(b) of the rules, modalities and procedures for the Article 6.4  mechanism.  5 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  specifications and as such sets out the requirements against which compliance is  evaluated. Article 6.4 mechanism standards include:  (i) Policy standards: A standard relating to the activity cycle, accreditation, the  development and/or application of methodologies or standardized baselines,  or governance of the Article 6.4 mechanism (which is not a methodology or  standardized baseline);  (ii) Methodologies: A baseline and monitoring methodology that prescribes  requirements to establish the baseline scenario, demonstrate additionality,  define the activity boundary, and calculate and monitor greenhouse gas  (GHG) emission reductions5 for Article 6.4 mechanism activities;  (iii) Standardized baselines: A baseline developed for a Party on a sub-national  or national basis to facilitate the calculation of GHG emission reductions  and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 mechanism activities,  while providing assistance for assuring environmental integrity;  (b) Procedures: A procedure contains a mandatory series of actions that must be  undertaken to demonstrate in a uniform and consistent way that the Supervisory  Body, the secretariat, activity participants, DOEs/AEs, and designated national  authorities (DNAs) comply with the RMP and the standards issued by the  Supervisory Body. Procedures contain requirements with regard to regulatory  processes in the Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle and in the accreditation of  operational entities, and operational processes of the Supervisory Body and its  support structure;  (c) Tools: A tool is a means of demonstrating (e.g. by calculating, determining,  estimating, elaborating, identifying or testing) that a specific requirement in a  standard or procedure is met. A standard or procedure indicates whether the use  of a tool is voluntary or mandatory. A voluntary tool cannot be mandatory. Article  6.4 mechanism tools include:  (i) Policy tool: Supports or is a part of a standard or procedure relating to the  activity cycle, accreditation, the development of methodologies or  standardized baselines, or governance of the Article 6.4 mechanism (which  is not a methodological tool);  (ii) Methodological tool: A standardized, stepwise approach to determine or  establish parameters, or identify information, and/or demonstrate  requirements relating to, or for application in, Article 6.4 mechanism  activities;  (d) Guidelines: A guideline contains supplemental information such as recommended  methods for satisfying requirements identified in the RMP or standards and  procedures issued by the Supervisory Body or best practice examples. Guidelines  are designed to promote a uniform approach to compliance with the applicable  standards or procedures; 5 ‘Emission reductions’ – Reducing emissions, increasing removals and mitigation co-benefits of  adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans are collectively referred to as ‘emission  reductions’ in this document.  6 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0  (e) Clarifications: A clarification is issued to alleviate confusion relating to the  application of requirements in a regulatory standard or procedure. Two types of  clarifications are issued by the Supervisory Body:  (i) Policy clarification: A policy clarification is published as an annex to the  report of a Supervisory Body meeting. It does not change the scope of the  requirement(s) that it is clarifying. A policy clarification is transitory in nature,  pending the subsequent revision of the related policy standard or procedure  which takes into account and incorporates the clarification;  (ii) Methodological clarification: A clarification issued in response to an  activity participant(s), DOE or other stakeholder wishing to seek clarification  on a methodology, standardized baseline, or a methodological tool. A  methodological clarification is issued in accordance with the relevant  procedure;  (f) Information notes: An information note contains factual and/or analytical  information on a particular subject matter relating to the Article 6.4 mechanism  rules and requirements, rulings of the Supervisory Body (that is, the reasons for  the decision), or the functioning of the Supervisory Body and its support structure.  Information notes do not contain requirements and may be published as annexes  to the Supervisory Body meeting annotated agendas or reports, and/or directly in  the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website in cases where  the secretariat is mandated to produce such notes;  (g) Forms: Forms are used to capture data or information required in Article 6.4  mechanism processes. A form contains pre-defined fields to be filled in by activity  participants, AEs/DOEs or DNAs. Completing and submitting forms is part of a  series of actions (how to) required by the RMP, or a standard or procedure issued  by the Supervisory Body. Forms are published directly in the Article 6.4  Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website;  (h) Glossaries: A glossary is an alphabetical list of terms relating to the Article 6.4  mechanism issued by the Supervisory Body to facilitate a common understanding  of terminology used in documentation of the Article 6.4 mechanism;  (i) Recommendations: A recommendation is a document recommending, endorsing  or supporting a course of action. Recommendations from support structures to the  Supervisory Body are published as annexes to the meeting reports of the support  structure, or directly published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the  UNFCCC website. Recommendations from the Supervisory Body to the CMA may  be published as annexes to the meeting reports of the Supervisory Body and are  included in the Supervisory Body’s annual report to the CMA.  7 of 10  A6.4-INFO-GOV-005 Decision and documentation framework Version 01.0 Figure 2.

Control and limitation of documents issued by the  Supervisory Body 10. When considering issuing a new document or revising and existing document, the  Supervisory Body keeps in mind the priority to consolidate, streamline and ensure  consistency of all its documentation. 11. Documents issued by the Supervisory Body, with the exception of methodological tools,  can be amended as described below:  (a) Substantive revision: When substantive changes are made to a document, the  document is replaced with a new document version and issued with a new primary  version number;  Example: Version 2.0 of a document is replaced by version 3.0, where the number  “3” indicates a substantive change to the information contained in the document.  (b) Corrective or editorial revisions: Corrections or editorial changes do not  constitute a substantive revision to the document.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SUPERVISORY BODY ......................................... 14  3 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 1. Procedural background 1. The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the  Supervisory Body), at its fourteenth meeting (SBM 014), adopted the “Standard:  Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and  assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”1 (hereinafter referred to as  “Methodologies Standard”) and the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving  removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”2 (hereinafter referred to as “Removals  Standard”), and made specific recommendations to the Conference of the Parties serving  as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA). Subsequently, the CMA  endorsed the approach by the Supervisory Body. 2. At its fifteenth meeting, the Supervisory Body approved the Workplan of the  Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) for 2025 which includes a request to prepare a  concept note on the applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and  vice versa. 3. At its sixth meeting, the MEP finalised a draft version of this concept note and launched a  call for public inputs which was open from 2 to 23 June 2025. In response to the call, 45  inputs were received. 2. Purpose 4. The purpose of this concept note is to address the mandate included in the 2025 workplan  of the MEP to prepare a concept note on the applicability of removal guidance to emission  reduction activities and vice versa. It aims to identify, for each section of each Standard,  whether its provisions should apply uniformly to all activity types or whether those  provisions should be applied with activity-specific considerations. 5. The MEP noted that many comments received on this concept note relate to the  requirements set out in the Removals Standard, “Standard: Setting the baseline in  mechanism methodologies”3, “Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism  methodologies”4 and the ongoing work by the MEP on matters related to non-  permanence/reversals. The MEP noted these comments and will consider them in its  future work. However, they cannot be addressed within the scope of this concept note,  which is limited to the purpose described in paragraph 4 above. 3. Key issues and proposed solutions 6. The Methodologies Standard generally applies to all Article 6.4 activities. The Removals  Standard generally applies to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks. However, there may be aspects of either Standard that may  not be feasible or appropriate to apply in all circumstances. 1 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf. 2 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf. 3 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-004.pdf 4 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-005.pdf  4 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 7. The MEP analysed the provisions in the Methodologies Standard and the Removals  Standard and identified that the applicability of specific provisions often does not depend  on whether the Article 6.4 activity involves emission reductions or net removals but rather  depends on the type of mitigation activity. This is illustrated through the following  examples:  (a) The provisions in the Removals Standard to address non-permanence should  apply to all mitigation activities that are subject to a risk of reversal, as reflected in  paragraph 89 of the Methodologies Standard and paragraph 10 of the Removals  Standard. This includes certain activity types that involve emission reductions and  all activity types that involve net removals;  (b) The provisions in the Methodologies Standard to address specific forms of leakage  do not apply to all mitigation activities. Some forms of leakage only occur in the  context of specific types of mitigation activities, irrespective of whether these  activities involve emission reductions or net removals;  (c) The provisions in the Removals Standard on monitoring and reporting are  generally suitable for emission reduction activities with reversal risks. However,  some monitoring approaches, such as use of remote sensing data, as referred to  in paragraph 26(g) of the Methodologies Standard and paragraph 11 of the  Removals Standard, are only suitable in certain sectors (e.g., forest-based  activities), irrespective of whether the activities result in emission reductions or net  removals. 8. The MEP therefore concluded that:  (a) The Methodologies Standard generally applies to activities involving removals.;  (b) The Removals Standard generally applies to emission reduction activities with  reversal risks. However, certain provisions only apply to certain types of mitigation  activities (see paragraphs 9 and 10 below). 9. In considering the applicability of the Removals Standard to emission reduction activities  with reversal risks, the MEP observed that four of the requirements of the Removals  Standard could be infeasible for certain activity types. Specifically, not all the provisions of  the following sections of the Removals Standard should be applicable to activity types that  cannot practically apply these requirements to the relevant greenhouse gas reservoir:  section 4.1 related to monitoring, section 4.2 related to reporting, section 4.3 related to  post-crediting period monitoring and reporting, and section 4.6 related to addressing  reversals. 10. Accordingly, the MEP proposes to exempt certain greenhouse gas reservoirs from aspects  of these elements of the Removals Standard, as discussed below for monitoring  (section 3.2.3 of this document), reporting (section 3.2.4 of this document), post-crediting  period monitoring and reporting (section 3.2.5 of this document), and addressing reversals  (section 3.2.8 of this document). These exemptions would apply only to those activities  where: (i) the greenhouse gas reservoirs are not under the control of the activity  participant, and (ii) the greenhouse gas reservoir is not in the same location as where the  5 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  mitigation activity is implemented, and (iii) changes observed in the greenhouse gas  reservoir could not be attributed to the mitigation activity.5 11. Apart from these exemptions, the other requirements of the Removals Standard would  apply in full. In all cases, the reversal risk assessment requirements in section 4.6.1 of the  Removals Standard would apply. This could facilitate alternative approaches to  addressing non-permanence, such as the use of discounting factors to account for future  reversal risks, informed by a consistent reversal risk assessment. 12. In the following, the MEP provides an analysis of all sections of the Methodologies  Standard and Removals Standard and provides a conclusion on whether the respective  sections should apply to activities involving removals and/or emission reduction activities  with reversal risks and, where relevant, to which type of mitigation activities the provisions  are applicable. Tables 1 and 2 below provide a summary overview of the findings of the  analysis.  Table 1.

Avoidance of other negative Yes  environmental and social  impacts and respecting  human rights and the rights  of Indigenous Peoples 3.1. Methodologies Standard 3.1.1. Encouraging ambition over time (section 4.1) 13. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition of  activities over time and should facilitate the deployment of low-carbon solutions and  technologies. The MEP notes that this section does not specifically refer to emission  reductions or net removals. However, the MEP is of the view that the provisions in this  section should apply to both activities involving removals and emission reduction activities.  Note that the activity-specific considerations related to encouraging ambition over time  may apply. The MEP notes that the baseline standard may be amended in the future to  incorporate further specific considerations for activities involving removals. 3.1.2. Being real, transparent, conservative, credible (section 4.2) 14. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to ensure  that all emission reductions or net removals are real, transparent, conservative and  credible. The MEP notes that this section refers to both emission reductions and net  removals. The MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both  activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.3. Establishing that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual (section 4.3) 15. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require  that the baseline selected shall be demonstrated as being below business as usual. The  MEP notes that paragraph 28 of this section refers to emission reduction activities. The  provisions in the “Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies” 7 apply to  mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions and net removals,  including ensuring that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual. The main  rationale is that the various possible reasons for setting baselines below business-as-  usual (ensuring conservativeness, providing incentives for implementing mitigation  technologies with lower emissions, ensuring that host Party countries can use part of the  mitigation outcomes to achieve their own NDC, etc.) equally apply to activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities. The MEP notes, however, that the baseline  standard may be amended in the future to incorporate further specific considerations for  activities involving removals. 7 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-004.pdf.  8 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 3.1.4. Contributing to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between participating  Parties (section 4.4) 16. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions for contributing  to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties, including the  application of conditions specified by the Designated National Authorities (DNAs) of the  host Party. The MEP notes that the provision described in paragraph 31(a) of this section  refers to emission reduction activities but does not exclude activities involving removals.  The MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals  and emission reduction activities. The main rationale is that the provisions required to  demonstrate equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties should  also support the sustainable development objectives of host Parties, whether the activities  involve emission reductions or net removals. 3.1.5. Aligning with the NDC of each participating Party, if applicable, its LT-LEDS, if it has  submitted one, the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the long-  term goals of the Paris Agreement (section 4.5) 17. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the  activity does not constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans  of the host Party with regard to the latest nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the  host Party, if applicable; its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development  strategies (LT-LEDS), if it has submitted one; and the long-term temperature goal of the  Paris Agreement and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. The MEP notes that this  section does not specifically refer to emission reductions or net removals. However, the  MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities. 3.1.6. Approaches to set the baseline (section 4.6) 18. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require  justification of the appropriateness of the choice of approach(es) for setting the baseline.  The MEP notes that this section does not specifically refer to activities involving removals  or emission reduction activities. The provisions in the “Standard: Setting the baseline in  mechanism methodologies” apply to mechanism methodologies related to both emission  reductions and net removals, including provisions regarding the selection of the approach  for setting the baseline. The main rationale is that it is important for both activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities that the baseline is suitable to the type of  mitigation activity. The MEP notes, however, that the baseline standard may be amended  in the future to incorporate further specific considerations for activities involving removals. 3.1.7. Addressing elements of paragraph 33 and paragraph 36 of the RMP (section 4.7) 19. This section describes provisions to address consistency of implementation of  paragraph 36 of the RMP with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP through the  application of appropriate approaches for downward adjustment of baselines. The MEP  notes that this section does not specifically refer to activities involving removals or  emission reduction activities. Paragraph 46 of the Methodologies Standard refers  specifically to negative emission technologies, which are understood to include activities  involving removals. The provisions in the “Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism  methodologies” apply to mechanism methodologies related to both activities involving  9 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  removals and emission reduction activities, including the provisions regarding  paragraph 33 and 36 of the RMP. This includes the provisions regarding the downward  adjustment. The MEP further notes that activity specific considerations may apply in  implementation of these provisions. The MEP further notes that the baseline standard may  be amended in the future to incorporate further specific considerations for activities  involving removals. 3.1.8. Encouraging broad participation (section 4.8) 20. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall encourage broad participation.  The MEP notes that this section refers to both emission reduction and removal activities.  The MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.9. Including data sources, accounting for uncertainty and monitoring requirements  (section 4.9) 21. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall include relevant assumptions,  data sources and key factors; account for uncertainty associated with emission factors,  activity data and other estimation parameters; and contain provisions requiring a listing of  data parameters that need to be monitored. The MEP notes that this section refers to  emission reductions or removals. The MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section  should apply to both activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.10. Recognizing suppressed demand (section 4.10) 22. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall recognize suppressed demand  in the context of an Article 6.4 activity, which is a situation where services provided to a  population are insufficient to meet the basic human needs such as minimum amount of  electricity for lighting, heating or cooling due to barriers, including low income or lack of  infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting such needs  requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline scenarios. The  MEP notes that this section does not refer to emission reductions or net removals. In  principle, this section is applicable to emission reductions and net removals. The MEP  notes, however, that suppressed demand is inherently linked to emissions growth from  increased energy use or other requirements to meet basic human needs. Net removals,  on the other hand, generally do not address unmet service needs related to energy  consumption or other requirements to meet basic human needs. Therefore, the provisions  for recognizing suppressed demand are primarily relevant to emission reduction activities.  However, the MEP notes the possibility that it may, in some instances, be relevant to  activities involving net removals. 3.1.11. Taking into account policies and measures and relevant circumstances  (section 4.11) 23. This section states that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to take into  account relevant circumstances, including national, regional, or local, social, economic,  environmental and technological, based on robust data and verifiable information. The  MEP notes that this section does not specifically refer to either emission reductions or net  removals or activities involving removals or emission reduction activities. However, the  10 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.1.12. Standardized baselines (section 4.12) 24. This section describes provisions for the development and application of standardized  baselines. The MEP notes that paragraph 63 of this section refers to calculation of the  GHG emission reductions or removals. The provisions in the “Standard: Setting the  baseline in mechanism methodologies” apply to mechanism methodologies related to both  activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. This includes the provisions  regarding standardized baselines. The MEP notes, however, that some specific provisions  in the section, such as the reference to facilities or equipment producing an output may  not be applicable to all types of mitigation activities. Moreover, the MEP notes that not all  types of standardized baselines will be applicable to all types of removals and emission  reduction activities and that the baseline standard may be amended in the future to  incorporate further considerations for activities involving removals. 3.1.13. Additionality demonstration (section 5) 25. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to  demonstrate the additionality of the activity. The MEP notes that this section does not  specifically refer to either emission reductions or net removals or to activities involving  removals or emission reduction activities. The MEP notes that the “Standard:  Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies”8 applies to mechanism  methodologies related to both activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities. 3.1.14. Leakage (section 6) 26. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall identify and avoid or, where  not possible, minimize potential sources of leakage. The MEP notes that this section does  not refer to either emission reductions or net removals. However, paragraph 64 of the  Removals Standard states that the activity participants shall address the risk of leakage  and account for any residual leakage in calculation of net removals in accordance with the  requirements set out in the Methodologies Standard. Therefore, the MEP is of the view  that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities. 3.1.15. Non-permanence and reversals (section 7) 27. This section specifies that mechanism methodologies shall address reversals, where  applicable. The MEP notes that this section requires mechanism methodologies to  address reversals of removals and emission reductions using an approach that is  consistent with the Removals Standard. The MEP is of the view that this section is a  general direction to employ a single, consistent approach to addressing non-permanence  and the risk of reversals, whether those activities involve removals or emission reductions,  or both. The MEP notes that the recent revision of the Activity Standard for Projects9,  which incorporated elements of the Removals Standard now refers to “Projects involving  removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks”. 8 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-003.pdf. 9 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf.  11 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 3.2. Removals Standard 3.2.1. Context (section 3.1) 28. This section refers to the relevant extracts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (WGIII) definitions of  removals, namely anthropogenic removals and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). The MEP  notes that this section only describes removals but does not exclude emission reduction  activities. The MEP notes that in some instances these terms may also be used in the  context of methodologies for emission reduction activities. 3.2.2. Definitions (section 3.2) 29. This section states the definitions of removals, reversals and activities involving removals.  The MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals  and emission reduction activities with reversal risks. 3.2.3. Monitoring (section 4.1) 30. This section specifies monitoring requirements for removal activities and emission  reduction activities with reversal risks. The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals  Standard refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with  reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP is of the view that the  requirements in this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks, with the exception of those greenhouse  gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 10 of this document10 10. 3.2.4. Reporting (section 4.2) 31. This section specifies reporting requirements without being specific to either activities  involving removals or emission reduction activities with reversal risks. The MEP notes that  paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP  is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply to both activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks, with the exception of those  greenhouse gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 10 of this  document. 3.2.5. Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting (section 4.3) 32. This section articulates activity participants’ obligation to monitor their activities to assess  whether any reversals have occurred in the post-crediting period (paragraph 26 of the  Removals Standard), specifies that activities shall not receive A6.4ERs for any net  removals that occur in the post-crediting period (paragraph 27 of the Removals Standard),  and provides conditions under which an activity participant may request permission from  the Supervisory Body to terminate their monitoring obligations in the post-crediting period  (paragraph 28 of the Removals Standard). The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the  Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism.  12 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0 33. The MEP is of the view that the requirements in this section should apply to activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks as follows:  (a) For those greenhouse gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in  paragraph 10 of this document, only the provisions of paragraph 27 of the  Removals Standard should apply;  (b) For all other greenhouse gas reservoirs, all provisions in this section should apply. 3.2.6. Accounting for removals (section 4.4) 34. This section articulates how greenhouse gas accounting shall operate in the context of  calculating net removals. The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard  refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks  under the Article 6.4 mechanism. Therefore, the MEP is of the view that the requirements  of this section should apply to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks. 3.2.7. Methodologies applicable for a renewed crediting period (section 4.5) 35. This section specifies that, at the renewal of the crediting period, the activity participants  shall apply the latest version of the applicable methodology. The MEP notes that  paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP  is of the view that this section should apply to both activities involving removals and  emission reduction activities. 3.2.8. Addressing reversals (section 4.6) 36. This section articulates how activities involving removals shall conduct reversal risk  assessment (section 4.6.1 of the Removals Standard); notify the Supervisory Body of any  potential reversals and provide assessment of the consequences of any potential reversal  events (section 4.6.2 of the Removals Standard); and remediate reversals through the  operation of a buffer pool mechanism (section 4.6.3 of the Removals Standard). The MEP  notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals  and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism. 37. The MEP is of the view that the requirements in this section should apply to activities  involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks as follows:  (a) For those greenhouse gas reservoirs subject to the conditions specified in  paragraph 10 of this document, only the provisions of section 4.6.1 of the Removals  Standard should apply;  (b) For all other greenhouse gas reservoirs, all provisions in this section should apply. 3.2.9. Avoidance of leakage (section 4.7) 38. This section specifies that activity participants shall address the risk of leakage and  account for any residual leakage in the calculation of net removals in accordance with the  requirements set out in the Methodologies Standard. The MEP notes that paragraph 10 of  the Removals Standard refers to activities involving removals and emission reduction  activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas paragraph 64 of  section 4.7 in the Removals Standard makes explicit reference to the Methodologies  13 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  Standard. Therefore, the MEP is of the view that the provisions in this section should apply  to both activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 3.2.10. Avoidance of other negative environmental and social impacts and respecting  human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples (section 4.8) 39. This section specifies that activity participants shall apply robust social and environmental  safeguards to minimize and, where possible, avoid negative environmental and social  impacts of the activity in accordance with the requirements referred to in this section. The  MEP notes that paragraph 10 of the Removals Standard refers to activities involving  removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4  mechanism. Therefore, the MEP is of the view that this section should apply to both  activities involving removals and emission reduction activities. 4. Impacts 40. This concept note provides further clarity on the applicability of different sections of the  Methodologies Standard and the Removals Standard. This will facilitate and inform the  further development of relevant standards (e.g., on addressing non-permanence) and the  development of mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. 5. Subsequent work and timelines 41. The MEP will consider and incorporate the analysis conducted in this concept note in the  development and further revision of relevant standards (e.g., on additionality, baselines,  addressing non-permanence, leakage, suppressed demand) and in assessing and  recommending mechanism methodologies and methodological tools for approval by the  Supervisory Body. 6. Recommendations to the Supervisory Body 42. The MEP recommends that the Supervisory Body considers and takes note of this concept  note.  -----  14 of 15  A6.4-MEP007-A03 Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa Version 02.0  Document information  Version Date Description  02.0 14 July 2025 MEP 007, Annex 3.

Procedural background 1. The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism, at its tenth meeting, approved its  workplan for 2024 and requested the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) to prepare  recommendations on products related to addressing reversals. 2. In particular, the Supervisory Body requested the MEP to prepare recommendations on  the following products relating to the recommendation on removals:  (a) Guidance on post-crediting period monitoring, reporting, and remediation of  reversals, post-reversal action and host Party roles;  (b) Guidance on late, incomplete, or missing monitoring report submissions and  treatment of activities for which a reversal results in removals level that falls below  baseline;  (c) Reversal risk assessment tool;  (d) Guidance on avoidable and unavoidable reversals and reversal compensation. 3. At its first meeting, the MEP initiated its work on the above issues and agreed to  recommend that, due to the overlap and interdependencies between the four separate  elements listed in paragraph 2, as well as additional removal-related issues in the  “Recommendation: Activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” on  which the Supervisory Body requested input, the four elements mentioned above should  be incorporated into a single integrated standard on addressing non-permanence and  reversals. 4. The Supervisory Body, at its eleventh meeting, agreed with the recommendation of the  MEP to consolidate the four related issues and to develop a standard on addressing non-  permanence and reversals covering these issues.1 5. The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Requirements  for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” (A6.4-STAN-METH-002,  hereinafter referred to as the “Removals Standard”)2 and made specific recommendations  to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris  Agreement (CMA). At that meeting, the Supervisory Body also requested the MEP to  continue its work on the above issues on the basis of the adopted Removals Standard.  Subsequently, the CMA took note of the adoption of the document by the Supervisory  Body. 1 See document A6.4-SB011-A02: Workplan of the Methodological Expert Panel 2024. 2 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf.  2 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 6. At its fifteenth meeting, the Supervisory Body adopted the work plan for the MEP for 2025.  The workplan also includes the development of a “Tool: Reversal risk assessment”,  including:  (a) Whether upper limits are needed with respect of the risk rating (overall) or specific  risk factors (within the tool), including options and science-based rationales for  upper limit(s);  (b) Risk rating that constitutes a negligible risk;  (c) Any further categorization of risk; and  (d) How remediation measures are taken into account in the risk assessment tool. 7. At its seventh meeting, the MEP continued to work on the draft standard and released for  public consultation a draft standard, consisting of two alternative proposals. Specifically,  the MEP was divided as to whether it is necessary to address some requirements in a  standard directed to activity participants and some requirements in a standard directed to  mechanism methodologies or whether all requirements to address non-permanence and  reversals can be provided in a standard directed to activity participants. To reflect the  different views and options, the MEP elaborated three different Appendices for the  purpose of seeking public inputs, with one option consisting in Appendix one and Appendix  two and the other option consisting in Appendix three. 8. The call for public inputs opened for a three (3) week period from 15 July to 4 August 2025.  The MEP received 112 inputs, which are publicly available on the UNFCCC website3. The  secretariat prepared an internal compilation and synthesis of stakeholder inputs. 9. At its seventeenth meeting, the Supervisory Body noted the MEP’s ongoing work on  implementation of the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the  Article 6.4 mechanism” related to addressing non-permanence and reversals. The  Supervisory Body requested the MEP to prepare a single recommendation, identifying  options where necessary. The Supervisory Body underlined that, while the MEP is invited  to explore the full range of potential approaches to operationalize the requirements of the  Removals Standard for consideration of the Supervisory Body, it shall stay within the  mandate set by the previous decisions of the Supervisory Body including the Removals  Standard. In relation to the request for clarification concerning the role of the host Party in  the Removals Standard, the Supervisory Body acknowledged that there is no need for  specific focus on “host Party roles” and decided to remove the “host Party roles” from  Table 1 of the MEP workplan. 2. Purpose 10. The purpose of this document is to address the mandate provided by the Supervisory  Body to develop a standard on addressing non-permanence and reversals, while  considering the guidance provided by the Supervisory Body at its seventeenth meeting. 3 See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/stakeholder-  engagement/calls-for-input/2025-non-permanence-reversals  3 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 3. Key issues and proposed solutions 3.1. Summary of public comments addressed in the recommendation by the MEP 11. At its eighth meeting, the MEP continued to work on the draft reversals standard and  considered stakeholder inputs received during the public consultation. The MEP  considered the large number of inputs received, with appreciation for stakeholders’  engagement, and revised the draft standard accordingly. The following non-exhaustive list  of changes may be of particular interest to stakeholders:  (a) A new option for mechanism methodologies to apply a materiality threshold for  determining that a release of stored greenhouse gases is not a reversal. This  flexibility maintains environmental integrity and allows mechanism methodologies  to avoid situations where a small loss of greenhouse gas storage triggers a  notification and mandatory reporting requirements that are unnecessary due to the  natural recovery of greenhouse gas storage within a monitoring period. This  provision is implemented in paragraph 39 of Appendix 1;  (b) An update to the definition of a “negligible risk of reversal\". The draft standard  released for public consultation proposed a range of views that would establish the  definition as meaning a loss of no more than between 0.1 per cent and 5 per cent  of A6.4ERs over a 100-year period. This document includes a narrower range of  views, from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent over a 100-year period and recommends  that the Supervisory Body select a value from within this range. This provision is  implemented in paragraph 3(g) of Appendix 1;  (c) A refined approach to allow for alternative approaches to reversal-related  monitoring and reporting requirements under a limited set of conditions. These  alternative approaches apply where it is practically infeasible to account for  reversals in the way set out in the standard. The MEP also further clarified in the  text that alternative approaches may only be used where this ensures, with a high  level of confidence, that potential reversals from Article 6.4 activities are fully  remediated in the crediting period and post-crediting monitoring period and do not  cause instances of moral hazard. These provisions are implemented in section 5  of Appendix 1;  (d) An updated approach to determine the contribution to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. The draft standard released for public consultation did not clarify  that the reversal risk assessment tool would be applied exclusively to changes in  storage in greenhouse gas reservoirs, which is now clarified here. These  provisions are implemented in section 6.5 of Appendix 1;  (e) A single approach to implement the fraction of total A6.4ER issuance transferred  to the Adaptation Fund (to implement share of proceeds (SOP)) and the fund for  cancellation to support overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE). In the draft  standard released for public consultation, the MEP proposed two alternative  options (Option 1 and Option 2). The current document now implements one option  (formerly Option 1). These provisions are implemented in sections 6.6 and 6.7 of  Appendix 1; and  (f) More flexibility with regard to the timelines for submitting reversal-related reports.  In response to public comments, Appendix 2 includes longer grace periods until  4 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  reports are considered missing and provides a more flexible option to request for  the extension of submission deadlines, including an automatic 90-day extension in  cases of force majeure or the unavailability of a DOE. These provisions are  implemented in sections 2 and 2.1 of Appendix 2, and are summarized in Table 1  and Table 2 in Appendix 2. 12. In addition to the changes referenced in paragraph 11 above, the MEP also takes note of  the following matters:  (a) Applicability conditions. The MEP clarifies that the list of examples of activities to  which this draft standard would apply should not be interpreted to prejudice either  the approval of any applicable mechanism methodology or the eligibility of such  activities for registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism. They are listed only to  clarify whether this standard would apply to the activity type if the Supervisory Body  were to approve it for registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism. This provision  is implemented in section 3 of Appendix 1;  (b) Annual reversal reports. The MEP notes that many public comments addressed  the requirements of annual reversal reports and seeks to clarify that the annual  reversal reports would be simple forms that ensure ongoing communication  between Article 6.4 activities and the Supervisory Body. Annual reversal reports  would either list the notifications of potential reversal events already provided to  the secretariat during the previous calendar year, or a declaration that none  occurred. No additional reporting would be required, and to minimize the burden  on activity participants annual reversal reports could be verified as part of  subsequent monitoring reports. These provisions are implemented in section 1.3  of Appendix 2;  (c) Treatment of reversals below baselines. The MEP has elaborated a single  approach to addressing reversals below baselines. These provisions are  implemented in section 4.3 of Appendix 2;  (d) Provisions for activity de-registrations. The MEP has elaborated a single approach  to activity de-registration requirements. These provisions are implemented in  section 4.4 of Appendix 2; and  (e) Other changes. The MEP has made numerous other technical and editorial  changes in response to stakeholder input. These provisions are implemented  throughout the document and referenced elsewhere in the cover note where  notable. 13. The MEP also took note of the comments received on procedural matters, including  requests for additional calls for input, webinars, and other opportunities for stakeholder  engagement. 3.2. Summary of public comments not addressed in the recommendation by the MEP 14. The MEP notes that some comments were not addressed in the revision of the documents  and the recommendation by the MEP because they:  (a) Were found to be not aligned with the Removals Standard (see paragraph 15 of  this cover note);  5 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (b) Relate to other standards that have already been adopted by the Supervisory Body  (see paragraph 16 of this cover note); or  (c) Relate to ongoing and future work by the Supervisory Body and the MEP on other  regulatory documents (see paragraph 17 of this cover note). 15. A summary of comments not aligned with the Removals Standard includes, non-  exhaustively, the following:  (a) Use of the terms avoidable/unavoidable versus intentional/unintentional reversals.  Paragraphs 9(e) and 9(f) of the Removals Standard define reversals using the  terms avoidable and unavoidable reversals. Some comments supported the  adoption of the terms intentional and unintentional reversals;  (b) Use of the terms ‘acceptable risk of reversal’ instead of ‘negligible risk of reversal’.  Paragraph 28(a) of the Removals Standard uses the term ‘negligible risk of  reversal’. Some comments supported the adoption of the term ‘acceptable risk of  reversal’;  (c) Duration of post-crediting period monitoring and reporting. Paragraphs 26 and 28  of the Removals Standard do not provide a fixed period for post-crediting period  monitoring and reporting. Some comments suggested using a maximum fixed  period for post-crediting monitoring and reporting;  (d) Reversal-related reporting requirements. Section 4.6.2 of the Removals Standard  requires activity participants to report observed events that could lead to a reversal,  submit preliminary assessment reports that determine whether a reversal has  occurred, and submit a monitoring report to quantify the amount and classify the  type(s) of reversals that occur. Some comments suggested not to include  provisions requiring notification of observed events, preliminary assessment  reports, and/or monitoring reports. Some comments also raised concerns about  the overall burden of these reporting requirements; and  (e) Addressing reversals. Paragraph 38 and section 4.6.3.1 of the Removals Standard  require activity participants to conduct reversal risk assessments by using the  reversal risk assessment tool and contribute A6.4ERs to a Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. Some comments suggested the inclusion of alternative reversal risk  assessment mechanisms that would not require the use of the reversal risk  assessment tool or contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account.4 16. Some comments relate to other standards that have already been adopted by the  Supervisory Body. This includes, non-exhaustively, the following:  (a) Leakage standard: Some comments suggested that international leakage not be  considered or recommended alternative approaches to calculating leakage. 4 The MEP notes that some suggestions in this category may be aligned with the Removals Standard and  are part of ongoing MEP work, as referenced in paragraph 17(c) of this cover note and indicated in  section 3.2.1 of Appendix 2.  6 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 17. Some comments also referred to work that is ongoing or will be undertaken. This includes,  non-exhaustively, the following:  (a) Large-scale crediting programmes: Some comments flagged that the current  provisions are not applicable or practicable for large-scale crediting programmes.  The MEP notes that the proposed standard is only applicable to projects and that  the Supervisory Body has requested the MEP to work on a concept note on large-  scale crediting programmes. The MEP will consider these comments in preparing  the concept note;  (b) Reversal risk assessment tool: Some comments related to the estimation of  reversal risk using the reversal risk assessment tool and raised the concern about  their ability to comment on the treatment of reversal risks without publication of a  draft reversal risk assessment tool. The MEP notes that the Supervisory Body has  requested the MEP to expedite work on a reversal risk assessment tool and will  consider the comments in elaborating the tool; and  (c) Use of insurance programs, host Party guarantees, and other reversal-risk-related  management provisions. Some comments suggested the use of mechanisms for  addressing reversal risks that were not elaborated in the draft document and which  are consistent with the Removals Standard. The MEP notes that the Supervisory  Body has requested the MEP to work on a concept note addressing options for  implementing paragraph 62 of the Removals Standard, as indicated in paragraph  57(b) of this cover note. 3.3. Structure and scope of documents to address non-permanence and reversals 18. In its work on the mandates provided by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraphs 6 and 9  above, the MEP prepared a document that provides direction to mechanism  methodologies on how to implement the requirements of the Removals Standard. This  content is found in Appendix 1 to this document. 19. In its work on the mandates provided by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraphs 6 and 9,  the MEP agreed that for several issues, a single solution could be applicable to all types  of Article 6.4 activities that are subject to reversal risks. This content is found in Appendix 2  to this document. 20. The MEP did not achieve full consensus in respect to the progression of the Standard:  Addressing non-permanence and reversals. A member of the MEP requests that the  Supervisory Body consider concerns that the draft standard would preclude participation  by land-based activities due to the required consistency with the Removals Standard for  the reasons listed below and believes that amendments to the Removals Standard would  allow more equal participation opportunity to both technological and land-based activity  types without lessening the credibility of the outcome. There are four main areas where  concerns are held in this respect, including in particular:  (a) Requirement for standard monitoring reports to be used for reversals monitoring  and reporting, with specifications that could trigger frequent monitoring, reporting  and verification into the long-term, incurring substantial cost that would  disincentivise participation by the land sector;  (b) Requirement to undertake post-crediting monitoring and reporting on an indefinite  basis in the absence of achieving termination of post-crediting monitoring from  7 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  demonstration of negligible risk of reversal of stored GHGs or remediation  according to paragraph 28(b) of the Removals Standard;  (c) Requirement to include avoidable reversals within the risk rating calculation, which  would be difficult to undertake and would inappropriately elevate the risk rating for  land sector activities;  (d) Requirement of immediate registry suspensions under certain conditions related to  observed events, which would create considerable investment risk. 21. The other members of the MEP noted that the MEP was mandated to work within the  scope of the Removal Standard and was not requested to provide feedback on the  Removals Standard as part of this work. 22. The other members of the MEP further note that the draft standard responds to the  mandate from the Supervisory Body to implement the Removals Standard and observe  that the draft standard was improved by incorporating stakeholder input to provide  additional flexibility to Article 6.4 activities, including in the land sector. These elements  include:  (a) Simplified methods for monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring  period, including methods to establish that no reversals have occurred for the  purposes of monitoring (section 6.1 of Appendix 1);  (b) A recommendation that the Supervisory Body request the secretariat to develop a  simplified template for monitoring reports used in the post-crediting monitoring  period (paragraph 61 of the cover note);  (c) A materiality threshold to ensure that land-sector projects are not required to report  immaterial and temporary losses of greenhouse gas storage as potential or actual  reversals (paragraph 39 of Appendix 1); and  (d) The potential for additional options to terminate post-crediting period monitoring  and reporting obligations, as mandated by the Supervisory Body’s request to  develop a concept note on this topic (paragraph 57 of the cover note) and as  indicated in the draft standard that additional approaches consistent with  paragraph 62 of the Removals Standard may be developed in the future  (section 3.2.1 of Appendix 2). 3.4. Appendix 1 (direction for mechanism methodologies) 3.4.1. Negligible risk of reversal 23. Paragraph 28 of the Removals Standard provides that activity participants may request to  terminate their obligations to conduct post-crediting period monitoring if they can  demonstrate that their storage of greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse gases  is at a negligible risk of reversal. In paragraph 3(g) of Appendix 1, the MEP agreed to  define negligible risk of reversal as a maximum percentage loss of the emission reductions  and/or net removals for which A6.4ERs have been issued, as calculated over 100 years  starting from no earlier than the end of the last active crediting period for an activity. The  MEP notes that, in further work on the reversal risk assessment tool, additional work may  be needed to address considerations related to the likelihood of reversal, the magnitude  8 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  of potential reversals, and the interactions between likelihood of reversal and magnitude  of potential reversals. 24. The MEP noted that the percentage chosen is a normative policy decision. The MEP  recommends the Supervisory Body choose a value within the range between 0.5 to  2.5 percent. The MEP further notes that a relatively lower percentage provides a relatively  higher confidence that no reversals may occur but may make it also more difficult to  terminate monitoring through the demonstration of negligible risk. The MEP further notes  that the percentage chosen has implications on the remaining risk that the buffer pool  needs to cover, with relatively larger percentages causing the buffer pool to bear a  relatively larger risk. 25. To assist the Supervisory Body in its decision-making process, the MEP notes related  definitions taken by other relevant actors in other circumstances. The MEP further notes  that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defines the term “virtually certain” as  indicating at least a 99 per cent probability in the context of describing the degree of  certainty in findings of the IPCC assessment process, analogous to a choice of no more  than 1 percent.5 3.4.2. Identification of applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs 26. Section 5 of Appendix 1 provides a procedure for how mechanism methodologies shall  identify relevant greenhouse gas reservoirs for the purposes of applying the mechanism’s  reversal risk assessment tool and allowing for alternative approaches to reversal-related  monitoring and reporting requirements under a limited set of conditions. 27. The MEP considered the concerns expressed by the Supervisory Body with respect to the  exemptions proposed in the “Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission  reduction activities and vice versa” and implemented a refined approach of the proposal  in Appendix 1. The MEP retained the three criteria included in the concept note in which  a simplified approach may be used but added footnotes to further clarify the approach,  including a specific example. The MEP also noted that the three conditions must be fulfilled  in conjunction which means that they only apply to a limited set of situations. Furthermore,  the proponents of mechanism methodologies shall appropriately justify that the conditions  apply, which shall be assessed by the MEP and the Supervisory Body. This ensures that  the provisions cannot be interpreted in ways that were unintended. 28. The MEP further notes that in circumstances where these conditions apply it is practically  infeasible to account for reversals in the way set out in the standard. This raises the  concern that certain types of activities, such as efficient cookstove projects, would  otherwise not qualify to register under the mechanism. The MEP also further clarified in  the text that alternative approaches may only be used where this ensures, with a high level  of confidence, that potential reversals from Article 6.4 activities are fully remediated in the  crediting period and post-crediting monitoring period and do not cause instances of moral  hazard. The MEP also clarified that the reversal risk assessment tool shall be applied by  all activities subject to reversal risks. 5 IPCC (2010) Guidance Note for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on the Consistent  Treatment of Uncertainties:  https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/05/uncertainty-guidance-note.pdf.  The MEP notes that these definitions are still in active use by the IPCC.  9 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 3.4.3. Quantification of emission reductions and/or net removals and reversals 29. Section 6 of Appendix 1 provides a procedure for how to quantify an Article 6.4 activity’s  emission reductions and/or net removals as well as how to quantify any reversals that may  occur. Paragraph 9 of the Removals Standard defines a reversal in relation to section 4.4  of the Removals Standard (“Accounting for removals”). Accordingly, the MEP  implemented a set of equations operationalizing section 4.4 of the Removals Standard to  address the following components:  (a) Net change in storage of a greenhouse gas or precursors of greenhouse gases:  Equation 1 specifies how to calculate the net change in storage during the activity’s  active crediting period, which is calculated in relation to an activity’s baseline  scenario. Equation 2 specifies how to calculate the net change in storage in the  post-crediting monitoring period, which, as a default matter, is not calculated in  relation to an activity’s baseline scenario. Together, both equations provide a  formal definition of what a reversal is and how to quantify the amount of a reversal;  (b) Net change in greenhouse gas emissions: Equation 3 specifies how to calculate  the net change in emissions in the Article 6.4 activity scenario, in the Article 6.4  activity’s baseline scenario, and due to leakage;  (c) Total A6.4ERs issuance: Equation 4 specifies how to calculate the total number of  A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to an Article 6.4 activity’s emission reductions  and/or net removals, drawing on the earlier equations and accounting for any  crediting deficit as discussed below;  (d) Crediting deficit: Because the net change in storage and net change in emissions  can lead to a calculation of negative A6.4ER issuance, it is necessary to track any  such crediting deficits and include them in the calculation of future credit issuance.  Equations 5, 6, and 7 specify how to calculate and update the crediting deficit;  (e) A6.4ER contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account: Equation  8 specifies how to calculate the number of total A6.4ERs that would be contributed  to the buffer pool, based on the application of the reversal risk assessment tool;  (f) A6.4ER contributions to the Adaptation Fund and contributions to overall mitigation  in global emissions: Equations 9 and 10 specify how to calculate the faction of total  A6.4ERs that would be contributed to the Adaptation Fund (to implement the share  of proceeds requirement, or SOP) and to the account for cancellation towards  delivering overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE), respectively;  (g) A6.4ER issuance to activity participants: Equation 11 specifies how to calculate  the number of A6.4ERs issued to activity participants, net of the contribution to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, the Adaptation Fund (SOP), and the account  for cancelation toward delivering OMGE. 30. In elaborating the provisions identified in paragraph 29(f) above, the MEP included in  Appendix 1 to its draft standard finalized for public comments at its seventh meeting two  alternative options to calculate the fraction of A6.4ERs to be contributed to the Adaptation  Fund (SOP) and OMGE. Alternative option 1 calculated the share of A6.4ERs contributed  to the Adaptation Fund and OMGE using the total number of issued A6.4ERs as the  denominator, whereas alternative option 2 calculated the share using a subset of the total  number of issued A6.4ERs, net of the buffer pool contribution, as the denominator.  10 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 31. The MEP further analysed these options and sought legal advice on this matter from the  secretariat. The MEP noted that the provisions in the CMA decisions and the Removals  Standard do not address the forwarding of A6.4ERs from the pending account to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. The MEP further noted that paragraph 58 and 67 of  the RMPs (decision 3/CMA.3) refer to the contribution for the Adaptation Fund to be  applied “at issuance”. Additional provisions set out in the transaction procedure in  paragraph 37 of the Annex I to decision 7/CMA.4 specify that first all A6.4ERs are issued  into a pending account. Subsequently, five percent of “issued A6.4ERs” are forwarded or  first transferred to the Adaptation Fund (paragraph 39), two percent of “issued A6.4ERs”  are cancelled to deliver OMGE (paragraph 40), and the “remaining” A6.4ERs are  forwarded or first transferred to holding accounts of activity participants or Parties involved  (paragraph 41). Based on these considerations, it appears that the share of SOP and  OMGE should be determined based on the total number of A6.4ERs issued into the  pending account, which corresponds to the Alternative Option 1 included in the document  prepared at MEP 007. This is consistent with the legal advice by the secretariat. Based on  this analysis, the MEP implemented this option in Appendix 1. In its further work on the  reversal risk assessment tool, the MEP will consider any implications for determining  contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. 32. In elaborating the provisions identified in paragraph 31 above, the MEP also noted that  neither the relevant Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 decisions by the CMA6 nor the Removals  Standard explicitly address the question of whether a contribution to the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account is a forwarding or a first transfer of A6.4ERs. In the draft standard,  the MEP included an approach that is consistent with the approach for SOP and OMGE  in decision 4/CMA.4, i.e. that mitigation contribution A6.4ERs are to be forwarded to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account without effecting a first transfer and that the forwarding  of authorised A6.4ERs is to be effected as a first transfer. The MEP requests the  Supervisory Body to confirm that this approach is appropriate. 33. In elaborating the provisions identified in paragraphs 29(e) and 29(f), the MEP also noted  that the requirements for quantifying the contribution of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, the Adaptation Fund, and the account for cancellation towards  delivering OMGE could be implemented in one or more higher-level regulatory documents,  such as the standard “Article 6.4 activity standard for projects” (A6.4-STAN-AC-002),7 the  procedure “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002),8 and/or  the procedure “Article 6.4 mechanism registry” (A6.4-PROC-REGS-001).9 3.4.4. Identification and quantification of reversals 34. Section 7 of Appendix 1 provides a procedure for how to identify reversals, quantify  reversals, and classify reversals as avoidable or unavoidable. It also provides direction to  mechanism methodologies to specify the data and methods that activity participants  should use to prepare monitoring reports and to conduct monitoring and reporting in the  post-crediting monitoring period. 6 See Decisions 2/CMA.3, 3/CMA.3, 6/CMA.4, 7/CMA.4, 4/CMA.6, 5/CMA.6 and 6/CMA.6. 7 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002-v01.0.pdf. 8 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-AC-002.pdf. 9 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-REGS-001.pdf.  11 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 35. Paragraph 39 of Appendix 1 also provides the option for mechanism methodologies to  determine a materiality threshold that applies to observed events involving the release of  stored greenhouse gases. This provision allows mechanism methodologies to  conservatively quantify the removals expected within a monitoring period on an ex-ante  basis. If an observed event leads to a release of greenhouse gases that is smaller than  this threshold, then the observed event is deemed not to constitute a reversal and the  activity participant does not need to notify the secretariat of the observed event or prepare  a preliminary assessment report. The MEP notes that these provisions only apply,  however, to activity types that generate ongoing net removals without ongoing  interventions by the activity participant. 3.5. Appendix 2 (direction for activity participants) 3.5.1. Reversal-related notifications and reports  Table 1. Summary of reversal-related reporting requirements  Timing of Whether verification is  Requirement Purpose  submission required  Notification Inform the Within 30 days of the No  Supervisory Body end of an observed  of a potential event  reversal  Preliminary Determine whether Within 90 days of the Yes, but only if the  assessment report a reversal has end of an observed preliminary assessment  occurred event report concludes that a  reversal has not occurred  Monitoring report Quantify amount Within 365 days of Yes  and classify the the end of an  type of reversal observed event  Annual reversal Ensure regular Annually, due 31 Yes, and verification can  report communication with March each year be done ex post as part of  activity participants the verification of a  monitoring report 36. Section 1.2 of Appendix 2 provides a procedure on how to identify potential reversal  events and prepare a preliminary assessment report to determine whether a reversal has  occurred. If a preliminary assessment report indicates that a reversal has occurred, a  monitoring report is required to determine the amount and type of the reversal. 37. Consistent with section 4.6.2 of the Removals Standard, section 1.2 of Appendix 2  provides for the temporary suspension of an affected activity’s registry account  functionality when a potential reversal event is detected and the restoration of that registry  account functionality once an activity participant either:  (a) Confirms that no reversal has occurred through a verified preliminary assessment  report; or  (b) Remediates any actual reversals per the provisions of section 4 of Appendix 2. 38. Because monitoring reports could be relatively infrequent for some activity types,  section 1.3 of Appendix 2 also requires activity participants to prepare annual reversal  12 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  reports. In cases where no reversals or potential reversal events occurred in the calendar-  year period covered by an annual reversal report, an annual reversal report may simply  state this conclusion. In cases where a reversal or potential reversal event occurred, the  reversal report will list the relevant events and notifications. No other information is  required. 39. The MEP notes that the purpose of the annual reversal report is to require a regular form  of communication with Article 6.4 activities. To reduce the burden on activity participants,  the annual reversal report(s) may be included within the next monitoring report for  verification. 40. The MEP also noted that the volume of information that must be included in monitoring  reports during the post-crediting monitoring period is significantly more limited than is  required during the crediting period. In this regard, the MEP recommends that the  secretariat develops a separate template for monitoring reports for the post-crediting  monitoring period that is simpler than the form for monitoring reports for the crediting  periods (A6.4-FORM-AC-021). 3.5.2. Late, incomplete or missing report submissions 41. Section 2 of Appendix 2 defines late and missing preliminary assessment report  submissions, annual reversal reports, and monitoring reports, along with a procedure for  how the secretariat will review submissions for completeness. Section 2 of Appendix 2  also provides for a series of escalating consequences that shall apply in cases of late and  missing monitoring reports. 42. Late reports trigger the temporary suspension of an activity participant’s registry account  functionality, which can be restored by the submission of the required reports before the  reports are classified as missing. Because a preliminary assessment report is required  whenever there is an observed event that could potentially lead to a reversal, and that  observed event separately triggers the same temporary suspension of an activity  participants’ registry account functionality, no additional consequence is imposed for late  preliminary assessment reports. 43. The consequences for missing reports are as follows. In the event of a missing preliminary  assessment report, the activity participant is required to prepare a full monitoring report.  In the event of a missing annual reversal report or a missing monitoring report, the Article  6.4 activity will be deemed to have experienced avoidable reversals equivalent to the total  number of A6.4ERs issued with respect to the activity’s emission reductions and/or net  removals and the activity participant is obligated to remediate this reversal according to  the provisions of section 4.2 of Appendix 2. 3.5.3. Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting 44. Section 3 of Appendix 2 describes activity participants’ obligations to conduct post-  crediting period monitoring of greenhouse gas reservoirs and reporting related to any  potential or actual reversals. 45. Consistent with section 4.3 of the Removals Standard, the obligation to monitor and report  in the post-crediting period is ongoing until activity participants can demonstrate either that  the stored greenhouse gases or their precursors have a negligible risk of reversal or that  the potential future reversal of this storage has been remediated. As a result, the time  13 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  period for post-crediting period monitoring and reporting may be indefinite. Some MEP  members are of the view that the post-crediting period monitoring could be limited in time.  However, the MEP notes that the Removals Standard does not provide for a definite limit  for the maximum duration of monitoring and therefore this option was not included. 46. Section 3 of Appendix 2 also provides a procedure for when and how activity participants  may request the Supervisory Body to terminate their post-crediting period monitoring and  reporting obligations. 47. As elaborated in Section 3.2.1 of Appendix 2, activity participants may cancel A6.4ERs,  with the number of A6.4ERs cancelled equal to the total number of A6.4ERs issued with  respect to the activity’s emission reductions and/or net removals. Cancellation of  authorized A6.4ERs is required for any authorized A6.4ERs issued with respect to the  activity’s emission reductions and/or net removals. Activity participants are eligible to  undertake these provisions at any point in the post-crediting monitoring period. 48. As elaborated in Section 3.2.2 of Appendix 2, activity participants may demonstrate that  their stored greenhouse gases or greenhouse gas precursors are subject to a negligible  risk of reversal, using methods identified by mechanism methodologies consistent with  section 7.4 of Appendix 1. Activity participants are eligible to undertake these provisions  only after a minimum period of time has elapsed in the post-crediting monitoring period,  as defined by mechanism methodologies consistent with section 7.4 of Appendix 1. 3.5.4. Post-reversal actions 49. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Appendix 2 provides a procedure for how unavoidable and  avoidable reversals shall be remediated. Unavoidable reversals are remediated by  cancelling A6.4ERs in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, with the number cancelled  equal to the amount of the unavoidable reversals expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide  equivalent. Avoidable reversals are remediated in the same manner, with the additional  requirement that activity participants shall replenish the buffer pool with an equal number  of A6.4ERs. For both avoidable and unavailable reversals, remediation requires the  cancellation of authorized A6.4ERs for reversals involving authorized A6.4ERs. 3.5.5. Reversals below baselines 50. Section 4.3 of Appendix 2 addresses the situation in which a reversal reduces greenhouse  gas storage below baseline levels (a “reversal below baseline”). It clarifies that the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account only remediates greenhouse gas storage losses for  which A6.4ERs have been issued. 51. Section 4.3 of Appendix 2 further clarifies that A6.4ERs will not be issued to Article 6.4  activities for any enhancements to greenhouse gas storage that are below baseline levels.  Article 6.4 activities that experience a reversal below baseline levels may continue to  enhance greenhouse gas storage and return to baseline levels, and A6.4ERs will be  issued for greenhouse gas storage enhancements above baseline level as usual. 3.5.6. De-registration of activities 52. Section 4.4 of Appendix 2 provides a procedure for how Article 6.4 activities subject to risk  of reversals can de-register. De-registration requires the cancellation of A6.4ERs, with the  number of A6.4ERs cancelled equal to the total number of A6.4ERs issued with respect  to the Article 6.4 activity’s emission reductions and/or net removals.  14 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 53. When an activity de-registers, the secretariat shall cancel A6.4ERs in the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, with the number of A6.4ERs cancelled equal to the total A6.4ER  contributions made to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account with respect to the Article  6.4 activity. The activity participant shall make the rest of the necessary cancellations. 3.5.7. Insurance coverage for reversals 54. The MEP notes that paragraph 59 of the Removals Standard provides that activity  participants should obtain and maintain sufficient coverage under an insurance policy or  comparable guarantee products to cover the risk that avoidable reversals occur. The MEP  was unable to identify any comparable types of insurance products. Accordingly, the MEP  has not included a requirement that activity participants obtain insurance or other  comparable guarantee products to cover activity participants’ avoidable reversal risks. 55. The MEP further proposes to address separate, insurance-related issues in the context of  remediating potential future reversals in the concept note requested from the Supervisory  Body pursuant to paragraph 57(b) below. 4. Impacts 56. The proposed recommendation will provide further clarity on the requirements with regard  to addressing non-permanence and reversals. 5. Subsequent work and timelines 57. The MEP will continue working on some elements of the mandates provided by the  Supervisory Body, including:  (a) A reversal risk assessment tool that addresses:  (i) Whether upper limits are needed in respect of the overall risk rating or  specific risk factors are to be included within the tool, including options and  science-based rationales for upper limit(s);  (ii) Risk rating that constitutes a negligible risk;  (iii) Any further categorization of risk; and  (iv) How remediation measures are taken into account in the risk assessment  tool.  (b) A concept note on options for the implementation of paragraph 62 of the “Standard:  Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. 58. The MEP notes that the proposed standard is only applicable to projects and not to large-  scale crediting programmes. The MEP further notes that several public comments raised  that provisions in the current standard are not applicable or practical for large-scale  crediting programmes, such as jurisdictional approaches for reducing emissions from  deforestation. After finalising a concept note on large-scale crediting programmes, this  standard could be amended in the future to address large-scale crediting programmes. 59. The MEP notes that many public comments referred to the challenge for private sector  entities to assume responsibility for monitoring and compensating for long or undefined  periods in the case of project-level activities. In this respect, the MEP notes that this  15 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  standard does not yet incorporate any possible alternative approaches for addressing  reversals in the post-crediting monitoring period that will be explored within the mandate  provided to develop a concept note by the Supervisory Body referred to in paragraph 57(b)  of this cover note. The MEP further notes that the standard could be amended, following  the finalisation of the concept note, to incorporate such approaches. 60. Similarly, the MEP notes that many public comments referred to the role of host Parties in  addressing reversals, such as in assuming long term liability and the linkage between  reversals under the Article 6.4 mechanism and reporting requirements under the Paris  Agreement. Because the Supervisory Body has clarified that the potential role of host  Parties is not within the MEP’s mandate for the current agenda item, the draft standard  does not address host Party roles. However, the MEP further notes that the standard could  be amended to address host Party roles following the preparation of the concept note  referred to in paragraph 57(b) of this cover note. 6. Recommendations to the Supervisory Body 61. The MEP recommends the Supervisory Body to:  (a) Consider the range of values proposed for defining a negligible risk of reversal,  specify a single value to be adopted for the definition of a negligible risk of reversal,  and adopt the draft standard “Addressing non-permanence and reversals in  mechanism methodologies” included in Appendix 1;  (b) Agree on the “Elements for inclusion in relevant regulatory documents” included in  Appendix 2 and request the secretariat, in consultation with the MEP, to  incorporate these elements into a draft revision of the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity  standard for projects” (A6.4-STAN-AC-002), the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity  cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002), the “Procedure: Article 6.4  mechanism registry” (A6.4-PROC-REGS-001), and the “Standard: validation and  verification standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-003)” for consideration by the  Supervisory Body at a future meeting;  (c) Request the secretariat to review and update, in consultation with the MEP, all  cross-references made between Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 to reflect the  approved “Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals in mechanism  methodologies” and to reflect the appropriate elements of the revised Standards  and Procedures referenced in paragraph 61(b);  (d) Confirm that the approach implemented in section 6.6 and 6.7 of the draft standard  is appropriate that mitigation contribution A6.4ERs are to be forwarded to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account without effecting a first transfer and that the  forwarding of authorised A6.4ERs is to be effected as a first transfer, consistent  with the approach for OMGE and SOP; and  (e) Request the secretariat to develop a simplified template for monitoring reports for  the post-crediting monitoring period.  16 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 TABLE OF CONTENTS Page APPENDIX 1.

Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence  and reversals in mechanism methodologies 1. Introduction 1.1. Scope 1. This standard sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies to address non-  permanence and reversals. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies  in developing methodologies and by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Methodological Expert  Panel (MEP) and the Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism  methodologies for approval. 1.2. Entry into force 2. This document enters into force on # date #. 2. Definitions 3. The following definitions shall apply:  (a) Active crediting period: The first crediting period of an Article 6.4 activity and any  subsequent crediting period that has been renewed;  (b)  DRAFT  Avoidable reversals: Reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have influence or control;  (c) Carbon stock: The quantity of carbon in a greenhouse gas reservoir;  (d) Crediting deficit: A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an  Article 6.4 activity caused by factors other than reversals1  (e) Greenhouse gas reservoir: A component or components of the global climate  system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored. For  the purposes of the Article 6.4 mechanism, this term excludes the atmosphere and  includes the biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere;  (f) Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent  agreements, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding  mandates, noting that regulatory environments may vary;  (g) Negligible risk of reversal: A risk of reversal that would result in a loss of no more  than [X] 2 percent of all the A6.4ERs issued with respect to the total emission  reductions and/or net removals achieved by the activity during its active crediting  period,3 calculated over a 100-year timeframe starting from no earlier than the end  of the last active crediting period;  (h) Observed event: An indication of any occurrence involving the release of stored  greenhouse gases that could potentially lead to a reversal; 1 See section 6.4 of this Appendix. 2 See section 3.4.1 of the cover note. The MEP recommends the SBM adopt a value within the range  between 0.5 to 2.5 percent. 3 Consistent with section 6.3 of this Appendix.  18 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (i) Post-crediting monitoring period: The period that follows the last active crediting  period, during which time activity participants monitor greenhouse gas reservoirs  for reversals and no A6.4ERs shall be generated;  (j) Reversal: A net loss in the storage of a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas for which A6.4ERs have been issued, calculated across all  applicable greenhouse gas reservoir(s) over a period of time covered by a  monitoring report;  (k) Reversal risk assessment tool: A methodological tool that is used to determine  the fraction of the total number of A6.4ERs to be contributed to the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account and whether an activity faces a negligible risk of reversal;  (l) Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account: A registry account, administered by the  secretariat in its role as administrator of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry, from  which A6.4ERs are cancelled to remediate reversals;  (m) Unavoidable reversals: Reversals caused by factors over which the activity  participants have no influence or control. 3. Applicability 4. This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for  activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to  also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes  of activities, policies, sectoral approaches). 5.  DRAFT  None of the types of activities or examples mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 7 is intended  to prejudice whether an activity or example is or should be eligible for registration under  the Article 6.4 mechanism. They are listed only to clarify whether this standard would apply  to the activity type if the Supervisory Body were to approve it for registration under the  Article 6.4 mechanism. 6. The standard applies to mechanism methodologies for activities involving emission  reductions with reversal risks and activities involving removals with reversal risks. This  includes, but is not limited to, the following types of activities:  (a) Activities increasing carbon stocks or reducing the loss of carbon stocks, relative  to the baseline, in any of the greenhouse gas reservoirs of the biosphere;4  (b) Activities increasing the storage of greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse  gases, relative to the baseline, in products or materials;5  (c) Activities increasing the storage of greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse  gases, relative to the baseline, in geological reservoirs;6 4 This includes, for example, afforestation, reduced deforestation, peatland rewetting, agricultural  practices to enhance soil organic carbon, activities reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass. 5 This includes, for example, capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its storage in construction  materials, such as concrete, or the storage of carbon in biochar or in harvested wood products. 6 This includes, for example, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in a geological  reservoir or capturing greenhouse gases from point sources (e.g., cement production plants, biomass  combustion) and storing them in a geological reservoir.  19 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (d) Activities accelerating, relative to the baseline, natural processes by which  minerals react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and lock it away as  carbonates;7  (e) Activities increasing, relative to the baseline, the capacity of the hydrosphere to  store greenhouse gases or precursors of greenhouse gases;8  (f) Activities preventing the release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels that in their  natural deposits or during storage after extraction would, in the baseline scenario,  interact with the atmosphere.9 7. The following types of activities are deemed not to be subject to reversal risks:  (a) Activities reducing the combustion of fossil fuels that, in their natural deposits or  during storage after extraction, do not interact with the atmosphere;10  (b) Activities reducing greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide through processes  not related to storage in a greenhouse gas reservoir.11 4. General principles and requirements 4.1. Principles 8. The following principles shall be applied in the context of addressing reversals to ensure  that information provided is a true and fair account. These principles shall be the basis for  and guide the development of mechanism methodologies:  (a)  DRAFT  Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for addressing  reversals shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters that may  have an impact on how reversals are addressed shall be included;  (b) Completeness: All relevant information to address reversals shall be provided;  (c) Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across  similar circumstances;  (d) Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative  information shall be reduced as far as it is practical;  (e) Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow  intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency  relates to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied;  referencing background material; stating documentation changes; and stating and  justifying all data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the  outcomes can be reproduced. 7 This includes, for example, enhanced weathering. 8 This includes, for example, storing carbon dioxide in the water column of oceans or enhancing the  alkalinity of oceans. 9 This includes, for example, closing abandoned oil wells, extinguishing coal mine fires, or preventing fires  from gas and oil wells. 10 This includes, for example, renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, and fossil  fuel switching. 11 This includes, for example, landfill gas capture and utilisation, abatement of nitrous oxide emissions from  nitric acid production, reduction of N 2O emissions from fertilizer application, or reduction of methane  emissions from rice cultivation or enteric fermentation.  20 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 4.2. General requirements 9. Mechanism methodologies shall ensure conservativeness in addressing reversals. This  shall apply to all data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used in the analysis  (e.g., assumptions made in the risk assessment). The degree of conservativeness shall  be based on the overall level of uncertainty. All sources of uncertainty shall be considered,  including uncertainty in data, parameters, assumptions, and methods. 10. Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the provisions in mechanism  methodologies to address reversals consider all national or sub-national policies, including  legal requirements, that are applicable to the relevant Article 6.4 activity. 5. Identification of applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs 11. Mechanism methodologies shall identify all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs:  (a) That may be affected by Article 6.4 activities covered by that methodology; and  (b) For which changes in the storage of a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas are eligible for the issuance of A6.4ERs. 12. Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to apply the reversal risk  assessment tool to the greenhouse gas reservoirs identified in paragraph 11 to determine  the fraction of the total number of A6.4ERs to be contributed to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. 13. The proponents of a mechanism methodology may propose alternative approaches to the  DRAFT  provisions listed in paragraph 15 if these alternative approaches ensure, with a high level  of confidence, that reversals from Article 6.4 activities are fully remediated in the crediting  period and post-crediting monitoring period and ensure that the alternative approaches do  not cause instances of moral hazard.12 These approaches may only be proposed if all of  the following conditions are satisfied for the applicable greenhouse gas reservoir:  (a) That activity participants using the mechanism methodology have no control over  the greenhouse gas reservoir;13  (b) That the greenhouse gas reservoir is not in the same location as where the  mitigation activity is implemented; and  (c) That changes observed in the greenhouse gas reservoir cannot be attributed to  the mitigation activity.14 12 Moral hazard issues do not arise because proponents of mechanism methodologies may propose  alternative approaches only where activity participants have no direction or influence over the relevant  greenhouse gas reservoirs, which is required to satisfy paragraph 13(a). In contrast, moral hazard issues  would be present if activity participants have direction or influence over the relevant greenhouse gas  reservoirs. In that case, however, proponents of mechanism methodologies would not be allowed to  propose alternative approaches because they would fail the requirements of paragraph 13(a). 13 In this context, control means that the activity participants have direction and influence on the  greenhouse gas reservoir through financial, policy, management or other instruments. 14 This could apply, for example, to a cookstove efficiency project that reduces demand for non-renewable  biomass, and that biomass is collected by individuals from forests on publicly held lands located a few  kilometres from their residences. Neither the cookstove project owner nor the participating households  have control over the forests from which biomass is sourced. The public entity could implement forest  management practices that enhance biomass stocks, unrelated to the impacts of the project; similarly,  the public entity could implement harvesting that would reduce biomass stocks, once again affecting the  reservoir but unrelated to the impacts of the project.  21 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 14. When a proponent of a mechanism methodology proposes alternative approaches for any  of the provisions listed in paragraph 15, they shall provide appropriate justification for why  the conditions set out in paragraph 13 apply to each relevant greenhouse gas reservoir. 15. Proponents of mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches to any of  the following provisions, so long as those alternative approaches meet the conditions of  paragraphs 13 and 14:  (a) General requirements for the identification and quantification of reversals (section  7.1 of this document);  (b) Frequency of submitting monitoring reports (section 7.2 of this document);  (c) Monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting period (section 7.4 of this document);  (d) Reversal-related notifications and reports (section 1 of Appendix 2);  (e) Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting (section 3 of Appendix 2); and  (f) Post-reversal actions (section 4 of Appendix 2). 16. None of the alternative approaches proposed per paragraph 15 shall limit or exempt Article  6.4 activities from following any other requirements, including, without limitation:  (a) The “Tool: Reversal risk assessment”;15  (b) The “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool” (A6.4-TOOL-AC-001);16 and 17.  (c)  DRAFT  Any monitoring and reporting obligations unrelated to the management of non-  permanence and reversals.

Quantification of emission reductions and/or net removals and reversals 18. Mechanism methodologies shall quantify emission reductions and/or net removals, and  any reversals, consistent with the equations set out in this section as follows:  (a) Mechanism methodologies shall apply all subsections of this section for use during  an Article 6.4 activity’s crediting period; and  (b) Mechanism methodologies shall apply section 6.1 for use during an Article 6.4  activity’s post-crediting monitoring period. 6.1.

Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine, for use during the  Article 6.4 activity’s crediting period, the net change in storage resulting from the Article  6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, consistent with the  following equation:18  ∆𝑆𝑡 = ∑ [(𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 − 𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 ) Equation (1)  𝑖  − (𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 − 𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 )]  Where:  ∆𝑆𝑡 = The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  applicable reservoirs i over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 =  DRAFT  The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  at the end of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t,  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 = The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  at the start of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t,  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑡 = The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the baseline scenario at the  end of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, expressed in  metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  𝑆𝑖,𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒,𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡,𝑡 = The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the baseline scenario at the  start of the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, expressed in  metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  𝑖 = The greenhouse gas reservoir(s) identified in paragraph 11 above and  included in the activity boundary of an Article 6.4 activity  𝑡 = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the report of the first  monitoring period 18 Note that ∆S may be determined by monitoring different parameters than those in this equation as long  t  as this delivers an equivalent outcome. For example, in the case of carbon capture and storage in  geological reservoirs, the flux of carbon injected in the reservoir may be a key parameter to estimate the  stock, rather than directly measuring the stock within the reservoir. Similarly, in the land-use sector, the  increment in stocks rather than the total stocks may be measured. For some activities, where direct  measurements are infeasible, it may be appropriate to use mass balances and/or modelling approaches.  23 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 20. A reversal occurs during an Article 6.4 activity’s active crediting period when the net  change in storage is less than zero (∆St < 0) in the monitoring report for any monitoring  period after the first one (i.e., for t ≥ 2), with the quantity of the reversal specified by ∆St.19 21. For monitoring reports used to quantify reversals during an Article 6.4 activity’s post-  crediting monitoring period, mechanism methodologies shall include equations that  determine the net change in storage resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period  of time covered by a monitoring report k in the post-crediting monitoring period, consistent  with the following equation:  Equation (2)  ∆𝑆𝑃𝐶,𝑘 = ∑ [(𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑘 − 𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 )]  𝑖  Where:  The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  ∆𝑆𝑃𝐶,𝑘 = applicable reservoirs i over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report k in the post-crediting monitoring period, expressed in metric  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑒𝑛𝑑,𝑘 = at the end of the period of time covered by a monitoring report k in the  post-crediting monitoring period, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  DRAFT  The quantity of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a greenhouse gas,  stored in the greenhouse gas reservoir i in the Article 6.4 activity scenario  𝑆𝑖,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 =  at the end of the Article 6.4 activity’s last active crediting period,  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  The greenhouse gas reservoir(s) identified in paragraph 11 above and  i =  included in the activity boundary of an Article 6.4 activity  The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the post-  k = crediting monitoring period, with k = 1 for the first monitoring report in the  post-crediting monitoring period 22. For monitoring reports used to establish that no reversal has occurred in the post-crediting  monitoring period, mechanism methodologies may include provisions to establish that no  reversal has occurred (∆SPC,k ≥ 0) without quantifying the amount of greenhouse gases or  their precursors stored in each applicable greenhouse gas reservoir (Si,activity,end,k). 23. For the purpose of paragraphs 21 and 22, a reversal occurs during an Article 6.4 activity’s  post-crediting monitoring period when ∆SPC,k < 0. 24. The approach set out in paragraphs 21 and 22 will in most instances result in a  conservative quantification of reversals. In few instances, the approach may need to be 19 Note that although the net change in greenhouse gas storage could be negative for t = 1 (∆S1 < 0), this  would not constitute a reversal because no A6.4ERs would have been issued to the Article 6.4 activity  24 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  amended or revised to ensure conservativeness. 20 In such instances, the mechanism  methodology shall include provisions for amending or revising the approach accordingly. 6.2. Net change in emissions of greenhouse gases 25. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine the net change in  emissions resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a  monitoring report t. This shall not include any emissions from losses of storage from the  greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in Equation 1 above.21 The net change in emissions  shall be determined consistent with the following equation:  ∆𝐸𝑡 = ∑ 𝐴𝐸𝑠,𝑡 + max (0, ∑ 𝐿𝐸𝑗,𝑡 ) − ∑ 𝐵𝐸𝑠,𝑡 Equation (3)  𝑠 𝑗 𝑠  Where:  ∆𝐸𝑡 = The net change in greenhouse gas emissions, from sources other than  any losses in storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  Equation 1, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  𝐴𝐸𝑠,𝑡 = Greenhouse gas emissions from source s included in the activity  boundary, occurring in the Article 6.4 activity scenario over the period of  time covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  DRAFT  𝐿𝐸𝑗,𝑡 = Greenhouse gas emissions from leakage source j resulting from the  Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report  t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e).22  𝐵𝐸𝑠,𝑡 = Greenhouse gas emissions from source s in the baseline scenario over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t, expressed in metric  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  𝑠 = Emission sources included in the activity boundary in the Article 6.4  activity scenario and baseline scenario, other than emissions from losses  in carbon storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  Equation 1  𝑗 = Leakage sources considered in the mechanism methodology in the  Article 6.4 activity scenario and, where applicable, the baseline scenario 20 For example, a single geological reservoir could be used by different activities, including activities  registered under other carbon crediting programmes or covered by emissions trading schemes. In these  instances, the methodology may need to include additional provisions to allocate any losses to the  different activities. Another example could be an afforestation activity where reversal could occur if no  further carbon is accumulated in the Article 6.4 scenario whereas further carbon would be accumulated  over time in the baseline, i.e. in the absence of the Article 6.4 activity. 21 For example, in the case of an afforestation activity, such emissions may include emissions from road  transportation or fertilizer application but do not include any carbon dioxide emissions from loss of above-  ground biomass, as the latter is included in the term ∆St in Equation 1. In the case of a direct air carbon  capture and storage activity, such emissions could include emissions from consumption of electricity  required for the operation of the capture plant. 22 Note that the maximum of zero and the sum of all leakage emissions is used in Equation 3 because, in  accordance with paragraph 10 of the standard “Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies”,  leakage shall be set to zero if the sum of all sources of leakage results in a net decrease in greenhouse  gas emissions or increase in greenhouse gas removals.  25 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  t = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 6.3. Total A6.4ER issuance 26. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine the total number of  A6.4ERs to be issued for an Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a  monitoring report t, consistent with the following equation:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = ∆𝑆𝑡 − ∆𝐸𝑡 − 𝐶𝐷𝑡−𝑖 Equation (4)  Where:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t  ∆𝑆𝑡 = The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  applicable reservoirs over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  ∆𝐸𝑡 = The net change in greenhouse gas emissions, from sources other than  any losses in storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  Equation 1, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  𝐶𝐷𝑡−𝑖 =  DRAFT  A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an Article 6.4  activity caused by factors other than reversals (a “crediting deficit”),  applicable to the monitoring report t-1 and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  𝑡 = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 6.4. Crediting deficit 27. Mechanism methodologies shall include equations that determine any crediting deficit  resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report  t (CDt), consistent with the following equations:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 ≥ 0, then 𝐶𝐷𝑡 = 0 Equation (5)  If 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 < 0 and ∆𝑆𝑡 ≥ 0, then 𝐶𝐷𝑡 = −1 × 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 Equation (6)  If 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 < 0 and ∆𝑆𝑡 < 0, then 𝐶𝐷𝑡 = max(0, 𝐶𝐷𝑡−1 + ∆𝐸𝑡 ) Equation (7)  Where:  The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 = reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t.  26 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity across all  ∆𝑆𝑡 =  applicable reservoirs over the period of time covered by a monitoring  report t, expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  The net change in greenhouse gas emissions, from sources other than  any losses in storage from the greenhouse gas reservoir(s) included in  ∆𝐸𝑡 = Equation 1, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)  A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an Article 6.4  activity caused by factors other than reversals (a “crediting deficit”),  𝐶𝐷𝑡 =  applicable to the monitoring report t and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  A net increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from an Article 6.4  activity caused by factors other than reversals (a “crediting deficit”),  𝐶𝐷𝑡−1 =  applicable to the monitoring report t-1 and expressed in metric tonnes of  carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).  The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  t =  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report. 28. When the crediting deficit is greater than zero, it reflects a net increase in greenhouse gas  emissions resulting from an Article 6.4 activity due to factors other than reversals. A  crediting deficit can occur when the net change in storage (∆St) over the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t is positive, but smaller than a net increase in emissions  over the same time period (i.e., ∆Et ≥ ∆St).23 A crediting deficit can persist from one period  DRAFT  of time to the next, so long as A6.4ER issuance is too small to compensate for the crediting  deficit. If a crediting deficit persists at the end of the last active crediting period, any such  deficit will remain unaddressed. 29. Crediting deficits affect future A6.4ER issuance requests and are adjusted, as applicable,  at each A6.4ER issuance request. When there is a crediting deficit from the period of time  covered by a monitoring report t-1, any non-zero A6.4ER issuance for the period of time  covered by the monitoring report t will be reduced and the crediting deficit updated  accordingly. This can happen in three ways:  (a) If total A6.4ER issuance is greater than or equal to zero (A6.4ERtotal,t ≥ 0), then  Equation 5 applies. This indicates that the quantity of emission reductions and/or  net removals in the period of time covered by the monitoring report t was sufficient  to eliminate the crediting deficit, if any, from the period of time covered by the  monitoring report t-1. If the crediting deficit from the period of time covered by the  monitoring report t-1 is positive, then the A6.ER issuance for the period of time  covered by the monitoring report t is reduced by the same quantity; and if the  crediting deficit from the period of time covered by the monitoring report t-1 is zero,  then the A6.ER issuance for the period of time covered by the monitoring report t  is unchanged. In either case, the crediting deficit for the period of time covered by  the monitoring report t is zero;  (b) If total A6.4ER issuance is less than zero (A6.4ERtotal,t < 0) and the net change in  storage is greater than or equal to zero (∆St ≥ 0), then Equation 6 applies. In this 23 For example, this could occur where an afforestation activity maintains previously achieved carbon  stocks but does not further enhance carbon stocks, while still causing emissions from road transportation.  This could also occur if a bioenergy project with carbon capture and storage or a direct air capture project  stores carbon dioxide in a subsurface geologic reservoir while emitting a greater quantity of carbon  dioxide to the atmosphere from its operations.  27 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  case, there is a crediting deficit for the period of time covered by the monitoring  report t equal to the total A6.4ER issuance (A6.4ERtotal,t) multiplied by negative 1.  This situation occurs when there is no reversal and therefore an overall increase  in total greenhouse gas storage (∆St ≥ 0), but the combination of any net change  in greenhouse gas emissions and any previous crediting deficit is greater than the  net change in greenhouse gas storage (i.e., ∆Et + CDt-1 ≥ ∆St);  (c) If both the total A6.4ER issuance and the net change in storage are less than zero  (A6.4ERtotal,t < 0 and ∆St < 0), then Equation 7 applies. This situation results in a  different formula for the calculation of the crediting deficit because the net loss in  greenhouse gas storage (∆St < 0) is addressed by operations of the Reversal Risk  Buffer Pool Account, rather than through reductions in subsequent A6.4ER  issuance. 30. The initial crediting deficit at the start of the first monitoring period t = 1 of an Article 6.4  activity (CD0) is set to zero by definition. 6.5. A6.4ER contributions to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account 31. Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, as follows:  Equation (8)  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑡 = ∑ [𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, ∆𝑆𝑖,𝑡 ) × 𝐹𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑖,𝑡 ]  𝑖  Where:  DRAFT  The number of A6.4ERs that are issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑡 =  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or  first transferred, as applicable, to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account  The net change in storage of a greenhouse gas, or a precursor of a  greenhouse gas in greenhouse gas reservoir i, resulting from the Article  ∆𝑆𝑖,𝑡 =  6.4 activity over the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and  expressed in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e)  The fraction of the net enhancement in storage of a greenhouse gas or a  precursor in reservoir i, resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over the  period of time covered by monitoring report t, as determined by the  𝐹𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑖,𝑡 =  reversal risk assessment tool, and used for the purpose of determining  the number of A6.4ERs to be forwarded or first transferred, as applicable,  to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account  The greenhouse gas reservoir(s) identified in paragraph 11 above and  i =  included in the activity boundary of an Article 6.4 activity  The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  t =  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 32. Mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches to determine  A6.4ERbuffer,t if:  (a) The outcome is aligned with the approach in equation 8; or  (b) The proponent of the mechanism methodology justifies, with appropriate evidence,  that a different approach that applies to Article 6.4 activities involving more than  one greenhouse gas reservoir will result in a conservative treatment of reversal  risks.  28 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 6.6. A6.4ER contributions to the Adaptation Fund 33. Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the total number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to an account held by the Adaptation Fund in the mechanism  registry for assisting developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the  adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation, as follows:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑆𝑂𝑃,𝑡 = 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 × 𝑆𝑂𝑃 Equation (9)  Where:  A6.4ERSOP,t = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or  first transferred, as applicable, to an account of the Adaptation Fund in  the mechanism registry  A6.4ERtotal,t = The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t  SOP = The share of proceeds designated to support the Adaptation Fund  t = The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 34.

The term OMGE shall be set at a minimum of 2 percent, pursuant to paragraph 95 of  Appendix 1 of decision 3/CMA.3. 6.8. A6.4ER issuance to activity participants 37. Mechanism methodologies shall include an equation that determines the number of  mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be forwarded or authorised A6.4ERs to be first  transferred, as applicable, to the accounts of activity participants as follows:  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑡 = 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙,𝑡 − 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑆𝑂𝑃,𝑡 − 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑂𝑀𝐺𝐸,𝑡 − 𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟,𝑡 Equation (11)  Where:  The number of Article 6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  𝐴6.4𝐸𝑅𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑡 =  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t and to be forwarded or  first transferred, as applicable, to accounts of the activity participants  The total number of A6.4ERs to be issued with respect to emission  A6.4ERtotal,t = reductions and/or net removals resulting from the Article 6.4 activity over  the period of time covered by a monitoring report t.

The number of the Article 6.4 activity monitoring report during the Article  t =  6.4 activity’s crediting period, with t = 1 for the first monitoring report 7. Identification and quantification of reversals 7.1. General requirements 38. Mechanism methodologies shall specify the data and methods required to:  (a) Detect changes in the quantity of greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in  all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs, consistent with section 6.1;  (b) Quantify changes in the quantity of greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in  all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs in the Article 6.4 activity scenario and the  baseline scenario, consistent with section 6.1;  (c) Determine whether a reversal has occurred, consistent with section 6.1; and  (d) Classify any reversal as being avoidable, unavoidable, or partially avoidable and  partially unavoidable, consistent with section 7.3.  30 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 39. For the purpose of identifying whether any observed event involving the release of stored  greenhouse gases has led to a reversal, mechanism methodologies may include  provisions to conservatively calculate the total removals expected to occur within the  monitoring period in which the observed event took place. If the total expected removals  within the monitoring period are larger than the sum of emissions from all observed events  involving the release of stored greenhouse gases within the same monitoring period, then  methodologies may determine that no reversal is deemed to have occurred for the purpose  of notifying the Supervisory Body of observed events involving the release of stored  greenhouse gases. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to activity types that  generate ongoing net removals without ongoing interventions by the activity participant,24  and shall not be applied to any other matters, such as quantification of emission reductions  and/or net removals. 40. For the purpose of preparing preliminary assessment reports, mechanism methodologies  shall require activity participants to submit a monitoring report in cases where it is  ambiguous as to whether an observed event of greenhouse gas release constitutes a  reversal. 41. For the purpose of preparing monitoring reports only for the post-crediting monitoring  period and only in cases where no reversal is reported, mechanism methodologies may  establish provisions for activity participants to demonstrate that no reversal has occurred  (i.e., to show that ∆SPC,k ≥ 0) rather than quantify the amount of the net change in storage  (∆SPC,k). 7.2. Frequency of submitting monitoring reports 42.  DRAFT  Mechanism methodologies shall specify the minimum frequency at which monitoring  reports must be submitted during the crediting periods and post-crediting monitoring  period. The minimum frequency shall be between one and five years and be based on the  nature, the type, and the risk of reversals. A less frequent requirement from within this  range (i.e., a larger gap between monitoring reports) is appropriate where the  quantification of emission reductions or net removals is associated with considerable  costs25 and/or where emission reductions or net removals can only be observed over  longer time periods.26 The minimum frequency may also change over time, while being  within the above specified range. 7.3. Determination of whether reversals are avoidable or unavoidable 43. Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to classify reversals as avoidable or  unavoidable, taking into the account the type of activities eligible under the methodology.  Where necessary, mechanism methodologies shall also include a procedure to apportion  the total amount of reversals into a portion of avoidable reversals and a portion of  unavoidable reversals. 24 This includes, for example, many forestry activities. 25 For example, costs for sampling the carbon content at plots in the land-use sector. 26 Forexample, changes in soil organic carbon following changes in land-use practices may only be  observable over longer time periods.  31 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 44. Mechanism methodologies shall classify the following types of reversals, inter alia, as  avoidable:  (a) Reversals resulting from the management of the Article 6.4 activity and any other  wilful actions by the activity participants;27  (b) Reversals resulting from mismanagement, neglect or illegal actions by the activity  participants, including as a consequence of bankruptcy, insolvency, or default;  (c) Reversals resulting from the intentional use of a product or material, in which a  greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas was stored under an Article  6.4 activity, such that a greenhouse gas is released to the atmosphere;28  (d) Reversals that have occurred following a failure to implement the risk mitigation  plan that is attributable to the activity participants; and  (e) Reversals deemed to have occurred when an annual reversal report or a  monitoring report is missing, as defined in section 2.3 of Appendix 2. 45. Mechanism methodologies shall classify the following types of reversals, inter alia, as  unavoidable:  (a) Reversals resulting from natural disturbances and extreme events;29  (b) Reversals resulting from declared war, undeclared war, or acts of terrorism;  (c) Reversals resulting from changes in policies or legal requirements that prevent the  activity participants from implementing risk mitigation plans; and  (d) DRAFT  Reversals resulting from illegal action by third parties that cannot be controlled,  influenced or managed using legal means by the activity participants. 46. Reversals caused by any factors that were not identified in an Article 6.4 activity’s reversal  risk assessment(s), as updated, shall be classified as avoidable reversals by default and  may only be classified as unavoidable with due justification (e.g., in cases of clear “force  majeure”). 7.4. Monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period 47. Mechanism methodologies may identify conditions under which activity participants may  or shall update their monitoring plan for the post-crediting monitoring period, e.g., updates  to monitoring techniques or approaches. 48. Mechanism methodologies shall define a minimum period for monitoring during the post-  crediting monitoring period, after which activity participants may submit a request for  termination of monitoring during the post-crediting monitoring period through  demonstration of a negligible risk of reversal. The minimum period shall be informed by,  inter alia, a consideration of the mitigation activity type and its associated reversal risks. 27 For example, harvesting of trees, slash burns, land conversion, changes in land management practices  that were not described in the PDD, induced seismicity or fractures in geological reservoirs due to  injection practices. 28 For example, combustion of biomass previously stored in buildings. 29 For example, wildfires, accidental fires in the built environment, pests and disease infestation, droughts,  hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.  32 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 49. Mechanism methodologies shall define a set of conditions or criteria that must be satisfied  in order for activity participants to demonstrate negligible risk of reversal,30 considering the  mitigation activity type and its associated reversal risks. The conditions or criteria shall  ensure that the greenhouse gases or their precursors that are stored by the Article 6.4  activity within the applicable greenhouse gas reservoir(s) have reached and will remain in  a steady state or, where relevant, are stabilized for at least 100 years from the year of  demonstration of negligible risk of reversal.  DRAFT 30 For example, in the case of sub-surface CO  2 storage, such conditions and criteria may pertain to the  behaviour of the stored CO2 in the geological reservoir. For biochar, conditions and criteria may pertain,  inter alia, to restrictions on applications that could result in the release of the carbon stored in biochar  (such as through combustion) and criteria on the characteristics of the biochar.  33 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 Appendix 2. Elements for inclusion in relevant regulatory  documents 1. This Appendix sets out requirements that are directed to activity participants and DOEs.  The elements in this Appendix shall be included, as applicable, in the:  (a) “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects” (A6.4-STAN-AC-002)1;  (b) “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”  (A6.4-PROC-AC-002)2;  (c) “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry” (A6.4-PROC-REGS-001)3; and/or  (d) “Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects”  (A6.4-STAN-AC-003)4. 1. Reversal-related notifications and reports 1.1. Overview of reversal-related notifications and reports 2. This section establishes requirements in relation to the following types of notifications and  reports:  (a) Notifications of observed event: The purpose of this notification is to inform the  (b) DRAFT  Supervisory Body about an observed event;  Preliminary assessment report: The purpose of this report is to determine whether  an observed event has resulted in a reversal;  (c) Annual reversal report: The purpose of this report is to indicate whether, at any  point in the previous calendar year, any observed events occurred or, if none  occurred, to document that outcome;  (d) Monitoring report: During the crediting periods of an Article 6.4 activity, the purpose  of this report is to quantify emission reductions and/or net removals for issuing  A6.4ERs or to quantify any reversals. For these periods, the provisions on  monitoring reports in this document complement provisions on monitoring reports  in other regulatory documents by elements that are relevant to activities that are  subject to risks of reversals. During the post-crediting monitoring period, the  purpose of this report is to demonstrate that no reversal has occurred or, if  reversals have occurred, to quantify the amount of reversals. 1 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf. 2 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-AC-002.pdf. 3 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-REGS-001.pdf. 4 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-003.pdf.  34 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  Table 1.

Observed events that could lead to a reversal 3. Activity participants shall notify the secretariat of any observed event involving the release  of stored greenhouse gases that could potentially lead to a reversal within 30 days of  becoming aware of the observed event. This notification shall include:  (a)  (b)  DRAFT  A description of the observed event;  The date(s) of the occurrence of the observed event, including a statement  indicating whether the event is ongoing at the time of notification;  (c) The location of the event; and  (d) Any additional information as required by the mechanism methodology. 4. If the secretariat becomes aware of a potential reversal event affecting an Article 6.4  activity, but has not received a notification from the activity participants pursuant to  paragraph 3, the secretariat shall notify the activity participants of its understanding and  request that, within 30 days, the activity participants either provide a notification pursuant  to paragraph 3 or an explanation of why no such notification is required. All notifications  and explanations provided under this paragraph shall be made publicly available. 5. When the secretariat receives a notification pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4, the secretariat  shall suspend the activity-specific registry operations of issuance, transfer, cancellation,  and retirement of A6.4ERs, except for transfers of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. The same registry operations shall be reinstated when an activity participant  satisfies the requirements of paragraphs 8 or 11, as applicable. 6. In the event of notification to the secretariat pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4, activity  participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report to determine whether the  observed event has resulted in a reversal and submit the preliminary assessment report  to the secretariat. The preliminary assessment report shall include:  (a) A description of the activities and methods used to monitor for potential reversals;  (b) A determination of whether a reversal has occurred; and  35 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (c) The data collected to inform the preliminary assessment report’s conclusions,  including remote sensing data where applicable. Activity participants may elect to  summarize the applicable data in the preliminary assessment report, provided that  the complete data are made available to the Supervisory Body as part of the  preliminary assessment report’s submission. 7. Preliminary assessment reports shall be submitted to the secretariat within 90 days of the  end of the observed event. 8. When a preliminary assessment report concludes, on the basis of transparent and  verifiable evidence, that a reversal has not occurred, it shall be verified and submitted  through a DOE. After conducting a completeness check, the secretariat shall forward the  preliminary assessment report to the Supervisory Body along with a recommendation on  whether the Supervisory Body should approve it:  (a) If the Supervisory Body approves a preliminary assessment report that concludes  a reversal has not occurred, it shall notify the activity participants of such approval  and shall instruct the mechanism registry administrator to resume the registry  operations suspended by operation of paragraph 5;  (b) If the Supervisory Body does not approve a preliminary assessment report, the  activity participant shall follow the requirements of paragraph 10. 9. When a preliminary assessment report concludes that a reversal has occurred, it shall not  be verified and shall be submitted directly by an activity participant. In this case, the  preliminary assessment report shall serve only as notice that a monitoring report is  required, and no further actions are required from the secretariat or Supervisory Body. 10. DRAFT  If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the  preliminary assessment report concludes that a reversal has occurred, the activity  participant shall submit, through the DOE, a verified monitoring report to the Supervisory  Body within 365 calendar days of the end of the observed event. The verified monitoring  report shall:  (a) Include a description of the monitoring activities and methods used;  (b) Identify the location of the event in the form of Keyhole Markup Language files or  similar formats as one or more polygon(s) or by specifying the coordinates of the  geographic boundary using a known coordinate system;  (c) Quantify the amount of the reversal by using the upper bound of the uncertainty  interval at a 90 per cent confidence level, with a description of how the amount was  quantified;  (d) Include data, records, and logs related to the observed event of greenhouse gas  release. If the data set is too large, a summary of the data and an indication of how  the full data set can be accessed may be provided in the monitoring report;  (e) Classify the reversals as being avoidable, unavoidable, or partially avoidable and  partially unavoidable. In cases where the reversals are partially avoidable and  partially unavoidable, the monitoring report shall quantify the amount of avoidable  reversals and the amount of unavoidable reversals, with the sum equal to the  amount of the total reversals;  (f) Review the activity’s reversal risk assessment and, if necessary, revise the  percentage contribution the activity makes to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool  Account; and  36 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  (g) Review the Article 6.4 activity's compliance with the requirements of the  Sustainable development tool, including by taking into account any negative  environmental or social impacts caused by the reversal and developing or updating  plans to prevent the recurrence of reversal-related negative environmental and  social impacts. 11. Upon the Supervisory Body’s determination that a verified monitoring report submitted  pursuant to paragraph 10 has correctly quantified the magnitude of the reversal and  characterized the type of reversal the following actions shall be taken:  (a) The secretariat shall take the actions described in section 4.1 of this Appendix to  address the avoidable and/or unavoidable reversals identified in the verified  monitoring report;  (b) The activity participant shall take the actions described in section 4.2 of this  Appendix to address the avoidable reversals identified, if any, in the verified  monitoring report; and  (c) Following the satisfactory completion of the actions described in subparagraphs  (a) and (b) as applicable, the secretariat shall reinstate all registry operations that  were previously suspended by operation of paragraph 5. 1.3. Annual reversal report 12. Activity participants shall submit to the secretariat, by 31 March each year, an annual  reversal report that indicates whether, at any point in the previous calendar year, any  observed events involving the release of stored greenhouse gases that could potentially 13.  have led to a reversal.  DRAFT  Annual reversal reports shall be prepared following any guidance provided in the  applicable mechanism methodology regarding the appropriate data and methods for  determining whether any such observed event has occurred. 14. If an annual reversal report indicates the presence of any such observed events, it shall  identify and list them along with the corresponding notification(s) provided to the  secretariat pursuant to paragraphs 3 or 4. 15. If the annual reversal report indicates the absence of any such observed event, it shall  state the basis for this conclusion. 16. Annual reversal reports shall be verified either:  (a) Prior to their submission to the secretariat; or  (b) Retroactively as part of the verification of monitoring reports, such that the  verification of a monitoring report also covers all previously unverified annual  reversal reports that pertain to the time period covered by the verified monitoring  report. 2. Late, incomplete or missing report submissions 17. Monitoring reports, preliminary assessment reports, and annual reversal reports shall be  submitted to the Supervisory Body on or before their respective deadlines.  37 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 18. Activity participants may make a request to extend a deadline by submitting a request to  the Supervisory Body through the secretariat. The secretariat shall review any request and  take the following actions:  (a) When a request is made because the activity participant’s process for DOE  contracting evidence the unavailability of DOEs or because of force majeure, the  secretariat shall automatically approve a single, 90-day extension of the applicable  deadline; and  (b) For all other requests, including requests for extensions beyond those granted  under subparagraph (a), the secretariat shall recommend that the Supervisory  Body grant the extension for any request that is justified with appropriate evidence  or deny the request;  (c) All requests and grants of extension or denials of requests shall be made publicly  available. 19. The Supervisory Body may develop additional guidance and consequences to address  matters not elaborated here, including to address any patterns of late, incomplete or  missing submissions that may arise in practice. 2.1. Late report submissions 20. A monitoring report, preliminary assessment report, or annual reversal report that is not  submitted on or before its deadline shall be designated as late. 21. Whenever a monitoring report, preliminary assessment report, or annual reversal report  DRAFT  has been designated as late, the secretariat shall provide an automated electronic notice  to activity participants that the monitoring report, preliminary assessment report, or annual  reversal report has not been received on time and has therefore been designated as late. 22. Whenever a monitoring report has been designated as late, the secretariat shall suspend  the activity-specific registry operations of issuance, transfer, cancellation and retirement  of A6.4ERs, except for transfers of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. If  an activity participant submits a late monitoring report before it is designated as missing  pursuant to paragraph 32, the secretariat shall reinstate all registry operations that were  previously suspended by operation of this paragraph. 23. Whenever an annual reversal report has been designated as late and it has not been  submitted within 30 calendar days since the notification referenced in paragraph 21, the  secretariat shall suspend the activity-specific registry operations of issuance, transfer,  cancellation and retirement, except for transfers of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer  Pool Account. If an activity participant submits a late annual reversal report before it is  designated as missing pursuant to paragraph 34, the secretariat shall reinstate all registry  operations that were previously suspended by operation of this paragraph. 2.2. Incomplete report submissions 24. The secretariat shall, subject to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct within  seven days a completeness check in accordance with the completeness check checklist  for following submission types, as applicable:  (a) Monitoring report submissions;  (b) Preliminary assessment report submissions that conclude an observed event has  not led to a reversal; and  (c) Annual reversal report submissions.  38 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 25. A preliminary assessment report that concludes that a reversal has occurred shall  automatically be deemed to be complete. The secretariat shall not perform a  completeness check for this submission type. 26. If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or  consistency in the submission, it shall request by email the activity participants or the DOE,  copying the activity participants, as applicable, to submit revised documents and/or  information. In this case, the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, shall submit  the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the request.  If the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, does not submit the requested  documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the  request submission is incomplete unless the activity participants or the DOE, as  applicable, provides a justification by this deadline, consistent with the requirements of  paragraph 18, for not submitting the requested documents and/or information on time. In  this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly. 27. Upon conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall notify the activity  participants or the DOE, as applicable, of the conclusion of the completeness check stage.  If the submission does not meet the requirements of the completeness check, the  secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants or  the DOE, as applicable, and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website. In  this case, the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, may resubmit the monitoring  report, preliminary assessment report, or annual reversal report with revised  documentation. The deadline for any such resubmission shall be 60 days from the date of  notification. 28.  DRAFT  Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject  to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct within 21 days a substantive check in  accordance with the substantive check checklist for submissions of monitoring reports,  preliminary assessment reports, and annual reversal reports. 29. If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or  missing basic information, it shall request by email the activity participants or the DOE,  copying the activity participants, as applicable, to submit revised documents and/or  information. In this case, the activity participants or the DOE, as applicable, shall submit  the requested documents and/or information within 60 calendar days of receipt of the  request. If the activity participants or DOE, as applicable, does not submit the requested  documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the  request submission is incomplete unless the activity participants or DOE, as applicable,  provides a justification by this deadline for not submitting the requested documents and/or  information on time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly. 30. Upon conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall notify the activity  participants and, where applicable, the DOE of the conclusion of the substantive check  stage. If the submission does not meet the requirements of the substantive check, the  secretariat shall conclude that the submission is incomplete and communicate the  underlying reasons to the activity participants and, where applicable, the DOE, and make  them publicly available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the activity participants or  the DOE, as applicable, may resubmit the monitoring report, preliminary assessment  report, or annual reversal report with revised documentation. The deadline for any such  resubmission shall be 60 days from the date of notification. 31. Any submission deadline established pursuant to paragraph 30 shall be subject to the  provisions for late, incomplete and missing report submissions.  39 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 2.3. Missing report submissions 32. A monitoring report shall be considered missing if it has not been received within 180  calendar days of the date of the notice referenced in paragraph 21. 33. A preliminary assessment report shall be considered missing if it has not been received  within 60 calendar days of the date of the notice referenced in paragraph 21. 34. An annual reversal report shall be considered missing if it has not been received within 90  calendar days of the date of the notice referenced in paragraph 21. 35. Whenever a monitoring report or annual reversal report is designated as missing, the  Article 6.4 activity shall be deemed to have experienced avoidable reversals. The  secretariat shall provide electronic notice to the activity participant and inform the activity  participant that it shall mitigate the avoidable reversals following the provisions of section  4 of this document. 36. The quantity of the avoidable reversals designated in paragraph 35 shall be deemed to be  equal to the total number of A6.4ERs issued with respect to the Article 6.4 activity,  cumulatively from the Article 6.4 activity’s start date through the date that the monitoring  report or annual reversal report is designated as missing, inclusive of the number of  A6.4ERs forwarded or first transferred, as applicable, to:  (a) The activity participants;  (b) The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account;  (c) The mechanism registry account held by the Adaptation Fund; and  (d) DRAFT  The mechanism registry account for cancellation towards delivering overall  mitigation in global emissions. 37. Whenever a preliminary assessment report is designated as missing, the observed event  in question will be deemed to have resulted in a reversal and a monitoring report  submission shall be required pursuant to the terms of paragraph 10. 38. Table 2 summarizes the consequences of late or missing report submissions, as described  above.  Table 2.

Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting 3.1. General obligations and duration of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period 39. For Article 6.4 activities that are subject to reversal risks, activity participants shall continue  to monitor applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs in the post-crediting monitoring period,  applying the provisions of sections 1 and 2, as applicable, to:  (a) Assess and determine whether any reversals have occurred;  (b) Quantify the amount of any such reversals; and  (c) Ensure remediation of reversals subject to the provisions of section 4. 40. The post-crediting monitoring period shall start on the first day after the end of the last  active crediting period. The post-crediting monitoring period shall continue indefinitely or  until one of the conditions in section 3.2 below is satisfied. 41. Activity participants may use a third party to perform monitoring in the post-crediting  monitoring period for the Article 6.4 activity. 42. Activity participants may at any time update their monitoring plan for the post-crediting  monitoring period as part of a request for a post-registration change, subject to any  conditions and provisions included in the mechanism methodology. 43. Activity participants shall submit, through a DOE, a monitoring report for the post-crediting  monitoring period no later than the date it is due, with the due date determined according  DRAFT  to the minimum frequency for the submission of monitoring reports as specified in the  mechanism methodology. If a monitoring report is submitted before the due date (an “early  submission”), the due date for the next monitoring report shall be the date of the early  submission plus the timeframe corresponding to the minimum frequency, as applicable on  the date of the early submission. 3.2. Termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period 3.2.1. Remediation of potential future reversals5 44. Activity participants may request to terminate their monitoring and reporting obligations in  the post-crediting monitoring period if they have mitigated all potential reversals for all  A6.4ERs issued to the Article 6.4 activity for emission reductions and/or net removals that  are subject to a risk of reversal (i.e., considering all issuances to the Article 6.4 activity  from the start of the first crediting period), as referred to in section 6.3 of Appendix 1,  directly through the cancellation of a corresponding number of A6.4ER units from any  Article 6.4 activity to a dedicated cancellation account in the mechanism registry for the  purpose of remediation of future reversals. For any authorised A6.4ERs issued to the  Article 6.4 activity, the cancellation shall be made using authorised A6.4ERs. 45. Once an activity participant has cancelled A6.4ERs pursuant to paragraph 44, it may,  through a DOE, request the Supervisory Body to terminate its monitoring and reporting  obligations in the post-crediting monitoring period at any time during the post-crediting  monitoring period. Within 28 days of receiving such a request, the secretariat shall  determine whether it complies with paragraph 44. If the secretariat determines that the  requirements of paragraph 44 have been satisfied, it shall notify the DOE and activity 5 Note that additional approaches consistent with paragraph 62 of the Removals Standard may be  developed in the future.  41 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  participants that the Article 6.4 activity is relieved of all obligations under section 3.1 and  make this information available on the UNFCCC website. 3.2.2. Negligible risk of reversal 46. At any time after the minimum post-crediting monitoring period defined in an activity’s  mechanism methodology has elapsed, activity participants may submit, through a DOE, a  request to the Supervisory Body to terminate post-crediting period monitoring and  reporting, accompanied by a verification of the conditions and information required. The  request shall demonstrate that:  (a) The stored greenhouse gases, or precursors of greenhouse gases, are at a  negligible risk of reversal, as defined in paragraph 3(g) of Appendix 1, calculated  over at least a 100-year timeframe starting from the year of submission of the  request; and  (b) All conditions or criteria set in the mechanism methodology for termination of post-  crediting period monitoring have been fulfilled. 47. To demonstrate negligible risk of reversal, activity participants shall:  (a) Provide evidence in the form of modelling or other methods, where relevant, about  the long-term stability6 of stored greenhouse gases, or precursors of greenhouse  gases, within the applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs in the presence of all  reversal risks that exist or are reasonably foreseeable based on current scientific  evidence after termination of the monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period for the Article 6.4 activity;  (b) DRAFT  Apply a conservative approach to ensure that the reversal risks are very unlikely  to be underestimated, taking into account the overall uncertainty in their  quantification;  (c) Implement conservativeness in determining the reversal risks (e.g., through  conservative assumptions, parameters, discounts) based on the level of  uncertainty (e.g., assuming higher risk values in case of higher uncertainties);  (d) Consider all causes of uncertainty, including uncertainty in data (e.g.,  measurements), parameters (e.g., representativeness of default values),  assumptions (e.g., projection of the future sequence of events within the project  boundary or space affected by the mitigation activity), and methods (e.g., models  used in quantifying the reversal risk factors and the reversal risk rating);  (e) Use the higher or lower bound, as appropriate, of the uncertainty interval at a 95  per cent confidence level to ensure conservativeness; and  (f) Confirm the outcome of the negligible risk demonstration by sensitivity analysis. A  negative outcome of the sensitivity analysis indicates that the risk of reversal  cannot be classified as negligible. 48. Upon submission of a request for termination of post-crediting period monitoring through  demonstration of negligible risk of reversal as per paragraphs 46 and 47, the secretariat  shall, subject to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, perform a completeness check. 6 As defined in the methodology.  42 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2 49. Complete requests for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period submitted to the secretariat shall be posted on the UNFCCC website for  public comments for a period of 30 days. 50. Within 60 days of the completion of the public review process, the secretariat shall make  a draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body to approve or reject the Article 6.4  activity’s request for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting  monitoring period. 51. The Supervisory Body may request additional information from the activity participant,  including based on inputs received during the public comments period, which the  participant shall communicate within 30 days of receiving the request. If the activity  participant fails to respond within this timeframe, the request for termination of monitoring  and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period shall be considered to be withdrawn. 52. If the request for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring  period is approved by the Supervisory Body, activity participants shall be relieved of all  obligations under section 3.1. The secretariat shall inform the DOE and the activity  participants of the approval and publish the decision by the Supervisory Body together  with documentation for demonstration of negligible risk of reversal assessment for the  Article 6.4 activity on the UNFCCC website. 53. When a request for termination of monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring  period through demonstration of negligible risk of reversal is rejected by the Supervisory  Body, the activity participants shall not submit a further request for termination of  monitoring and reporting in the post-crediting monitoring period through demonstration of 4. Post-reversal actions DRAFT  negligible risk of reversal for at least three years. 4.1. Remediating unavoidable reversals 54. When the secretariat has received a complete and verified monitoring report indicating  that unavoidable reversals have occurred, the secretariat, as the registry administrator,  shall cancel A6.4ERs held in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account as follows:  (a) The number of A6.4ERs cancelled shall be equal to the amount of the unavoidable  reversals, as expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;  (b) The number of each type of A6.4ERs cancelled (whether Mitigation Contribution  Units or authorized A6.4ERs) shall be based on the proportion of Mitigation  Contribution Units or authorized A6.4ERs issued for the Article 6.4 activity’s  emission reductions and/or net removals at the time of the reversal;  (c) The cancellation of A6.4ERs from the Article 6.4 activity experiencing the reversal  shall be prioritised over A6.4ERs from other Article 6.4 activities, until no such  A6.4ERs are available in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account; and  (d) According to further criteria that may be specified at a future point in time. 55. The mechanism registry shall indicate that the A6.4ERs were cancelled for the purpose of  remediating unavoidable reversals and publish the serial numbers of A6.4ERs cancelled. 4.2. Remediating avoidable reversals 56. When the secretariat has received a complete and verified monitoring report indicating  that avoidable reversals have occurred, or when an activity is deemed to have experienced  43 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  avoidable reversals subject to section 2.3, the secretariat, as the registry administrator,  shall cancel A6.4ERs held in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account as follows:  (a) The number of A6.4ERs cancelled shall be equal to the amount of the avoidable  reversals, as expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;  (b) The number of each type of A6.4ERs cancelled (whether mitigation contribution  A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs) shall be based on the proportion of mitigation  contribution A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs issued for the Article 6.4 activity’s  emission reductions and/or net removals at the time of the reversal;  (c) The cancellation of A6.4ERs from the Article 6.4 activity experiencing the reversal  shall be prioritised over A6.4ERs from other Article 6.4 activities, until no such  A6.4ERs are available in the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account; and  (d) According to further criteria that may be specified at a future point in time. 57. The mechanism registry shall indicate that the A6.4ERs were cancelled for the purpose of  remediating avoidable reversals and publish the serial numbers of the A6.4ERs cancelled. 58. When avoidable reversals occur, activity participants shall forward or first transfer, as  applicable, A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account as follows:  (a) The number of A6.4ERs forwarded or first transferred shall be equal to the amount  of the avoidable reversals, as expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent;  and  (b) The number of each type of A6.4ERs cancelled (whether mitigation contribution  DRAFT  A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs) shall be based on the proportion of mitigation  contribution A6.4ERs or authorized A6.4ERs issued for the activity’s emission  reductions and/or net removals, cumulatively from the Article 6.4 activity start date  through the time of the reversal; and  (c) According to further criteria that may be specified at a future point in time. 4.3. Reversals below baseline 59. Only the fraction of a reversal that corresponds to a net change in storage of greenhouse  gases or their precursors for which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be remediated  through the provisions of sections 4.1 and 4.2. Reversals below an Article 6.4 activity’s  baseline, as determined by mechanism methodologies, shall not be remediated through  the provisions of sections 4.1 and 4.2. 60. When an Article 6.4 activity experiences a reversal below its baseline, as determined by  mechanism methodologies, A6.4ERs shall not be subsequently issued for a net change  in storage of greenhouse gases or their precursors, unless the sum of the quantity of  greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs  in the Article 6.4 activity scenario is greater than or equal to the sum of the quantity of  greenhouse gases or their precursors stored in all applicable greenhouse gas reservoirs  44 of 45  A6.4-MEP008-A03 Draft Standard: Addressing non-permanence and reversals Version 02.2  in the Article 6.4 activity’s baseline, as determined by mechanism methodologies, with  both sums expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.7 4.4. De-registration of activities 61. When an activity participant makes a request to de-register a registered Article 6.4 activity  that is subject to reversal risks, the following steps shall be taken:  (a) The activity participant shall cancel A6.4ERs, with the number of A6.4ERs  cancelled equal to the number of A6.4ERs that have been issued with respect to  emission reductions and/or net removals from that activity to date, except for those  A6.4ERs that were contributed to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account; and  (b) The secretariat, acting as the registry administrator, shall cancel A6.4ERs held in  the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, with the number cancelled equal to the  number of A6.4ERs that have been issued with respect to emission reductions  and/or net removals from that activity to date and that were contributed to the  Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account.  -----  Document information  Version Date Description  02.2 16 September 2025  DRAFT  MEP008, Annex 3.  Editorial changes removing duplication and enhance clarity.  02.1 11 September 2025 MEP 008, Annex 3.

This  version takes into account the inputs received in response to the  call for input on this draft document.  01.0 15 July 2025 MEP 007, Annex 4.  A call for input on this document will be issued following the  conclusion of MEP 007 meeting. The input received will be  considered by the MEP for the further development of this  document at MEP 008. If no input is received, this document will  be considered by the SBM at its next meeting.  Decision Class: Regulatory  Document Type: Standard  Business Function: Methodology, Activity Participants  Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, reversals, non-permanence, methodologies, activity participants 7 For example, the greenhouse gases stored in a greenhouse gas reservoir in an Article 6.4 activity could  be 30 tCO2e at the start of the period covered by a monitoring report and fall to 10 tCO2e at the end of  that period due to an unavoidable reversal, while the baseline storage is 20 tCO2e throughout the period.  In this case, the reversal due to the decline from 30 to 20 tCO2e would be remediated by the Reversal  Risk Buffer Pool Account, while the reversal due to the decline from 20 to 10 would not. To address this  latter reversal, the activity participants would only be able to request for issuance of A6.4ERs for  enhancements in stored greenhouse gases above 20 tCO2e.  45 of 45"}]
