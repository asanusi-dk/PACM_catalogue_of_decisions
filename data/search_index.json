Introduction\n1.1.     Background\n1.       The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n         Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism\n         established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to\n         ensure transparency of decision-making and make publicly available its decision-making\n         framework and decisions, including standards, procedures and related documents.1\n\n2.       This document addresses the mandate of the CMA. It will be updated, as required, should\n         changes to the classes of decisions and types of documents be requested by the\n         Supervisory Body.\n\n1.2.     Objective\n3.       The objectives of this document are to:\n         (a)    Ensure transparency, consistency and clarity within the body of decisions and\n                documents issued by the Supervisory Body;\n\n         (b)    Contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory management under the\n                Supervisory Body and assist stakeholders in locating requirements of the Article\n                6.4 mechanism in a timely and efficient manner;\n\n         (c)    Facilitate the successful operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n2.       Scope\n4.       This document describes:\n\n         (a)    The hierarchical relationship between decisions taken by the CMA and decisions\n                of the Supervisory Body;\n\n         (b)    The different classes of decisions taken by the Supervisory Body;\n\n         (c)    The different document types containing these decisions;\n\n         (d)    The hierarchical relationship between Supervisory Body document types;\n\n         (e)    The relationship between Supervisory Body decision classes and document types;\n\n         (f)    The control and limitation of documents issued by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n1    See decision 3/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 21 contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1\n     available at: https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.\n\n\n\n                                               3 of 10\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-005\nDecision and documentation framework\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n3.        Decision hierarchy between the CMA and the Supervisory\n          Body\n5.        The CMA is the ultimate decision-making body of the Article 6.4 mechanism. The CMA\n          has authority over and provides guidance to the Supervisory Body through the adoption\n          of decisions, which are published in reports of the CMA. The decisions of the CMA outline\n          formal expectations with respect to the Article 6.4 mechanism. They set direction and\n          establish precedents which serve as reference for future decision-making and the basis\n          for operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism. CMA decisions are treated as mandatory\n          requirements or rules intended to ensure the successful implementation of the Paris\n          Agreement.2\n\n6.        The Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of the Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under\n          the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory\n          Body has authority over and provides guidance to the activities and processes of the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the Supervisory Body elaborate upon and\n          must be consistent with decisions of the CMA.\n\n7.        Decisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded in the meeting reports of the Supervisory\n          Body and their accompanying annexes, which together form the official record of the\n          proceedings of the Supervisory Body meetings. The authoritative set of documents\n          containing regulatory decisions is published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of\n          the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website.\n\n4.        Supervisory Body decision classes\n8.        Taking into account both the rule-making and rule-enforcing roles of the Supervisory Body,\n          decisions of the Supervisory Body are divided into three classes:\n\n          (a)     Regulatory decisions: relate to the adoption of, or revision to, the Article 6.4\n                  mechanism rules and requirements developed under the direction of the\n                  Supervisory Body, to be followed by the Supervisory Body, its support structure\n                  and stakeholders.3 Regulatory decisions are reflected in the adoption of, or\n                  revisions to, standards (including policy standards, methodologies and\n                  standardized baselines), procedures, tools (including policy and methodological\n                  tools), guidelines and clarifications (including policy and methodological\n                  clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the\n                  Supervisory Body;\n\n\n\n\n2    The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196\n     Parties at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris, on 12 December and entered\n     into force on 4 November 2016. Information on the Paris Agreement, including the text of the agreement,\n     is available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement.\n3     ‘Support structure’ refers to, for example, experts, supporting bodies established by the Supervisory\n     Body and/or the secretariat. ‘Stakeholder’ refers to the entities, groups, fora, communities or individuals\n     that have a role in the implementation of the functions of the Supervisory Body or that may affect or be\n     directly affected by the recommendations and actions of the Supervisory Body .\n\n\n\n                                                     4 of 10\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-005\nDecision and documentation framework\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n          (b)     Rulings: relate to the determination of whether the actions of participants of an\n                  activity4 under the Article 6.4 mechanism, applicant entities (AEs), or designated\n                  operational entities (DOEs) are in compliance with the Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n                  and requirements. Rulings of the Supervisory Body are published in the main body\n                  of the meeting reports of the Supervisory Body and/or as separate documents;\n\n          (c)     Operational decisions: relate to the functioning of the Supervisory Body and its\n                  support structure (for example, experts, supporting bodies and secretariat) and\n                  include decisions on finance; administration; programmes of work; internal\n                  operating procedures; and the establishment of supporting bodies. Operational\n                  decisions are either published within the main body of the meeting reports of the\n                  Supervisory Body or reflected in the adoption of, or revision to, internal\n                  standards, procedures and guidelines, or in the publishing of information notes.\n\nFigure 1.       Decision classes\n\n\n\n\n                                            CMA decisions\n\n                                      provides for authority over and\n                                         guidance relating to the\n                                            A6.4 mechanism\n\n\n\n\n        Supervisory Body                 Supervisory Body                Supervisory Body\n       regulatory decisions                   rulings                   operational decisions\n\n      provides for the adoption          provides for decisions             provides for the\n       and revision of Article          on compliance with the             functioning of the\n        6.4 mechanism rules              Article 6.4 mechanism          Supervisory Body and its\n                                        rules and requirements           supporting structures\n          and requirements\n\n\n\n\n5.        Document types\n9.        The body of documents developed under the direction of the Supervisory Body that serve\n          to operationalize the Article 6.4 mechanism, includes:\n\n          (a)     Standards: Standards are designed to achieve a uniform approach to compliance\n                  with the rules, modalities and procedures for the Article 6.4 mechanism (RMP). A\n                  standard describes mandatory levels of performance and/or provides mandatory\n\n4    The activity may be a project, programme of activities or other type of activity approved by the\n     Supervisory Body, as paragraph 31(b) of the rules, modalities and procedures for the Article 6.4\n     mechanism.\n\n\n\n                                                 5 of 10\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-005\nDecision and documentation framework\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                specifications and as such sets out the requirements against which compliance is\n                evaluated. Article 6.4 mechanism standards include:\n\n                (i)     Policy standards: A standard relating to the activity cycle, accreditation, the\n                        development and/or application of methodologies or standardized baselines,\n                        or governance of the Article 6.4 mechanism (which is not a methodology or\n                        standardized baseline);\n                (ii)    Methodologies: A baseline and monitoring methodology that prescribes\n                        requirements to establish the baseline scenario, demonstrate additionality,\n                        define the activity boundary, and calculate and monitor greenhouse gas\n                        (GHG) emission reductions5 for Article 6.4 mechanism activities;\n\n                (iii)   Standardized baselines: A baseline developed for a Party on a sub-national\n                        or national basis to facilitate the calculation of GHG emission reductions\n                        and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 mechanism activities,\n                        while providing assistance for assuring environmental integrity;\n\n         (b)    Procedures: A procedure contains a mandatory series of actions that must be\n                undertaken to demonstrate in a uniform and consistent way that the Supervisory\n                Body, the secretariat, activity participants, DOEs/AEs, and designated national\n                authorities (DNAs) comply with the RMP and the standards issued by the\n                Supervisory Body. Procedures contain requirements with regard to regulatory\n                processes in the Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle and in the accreditation of\n                operational entities, and operational processes of the Supervisory Body and its\n                support structure;\n\n         (c)    Tools: A tool is a means of demonstrating (e.g. by calculating, determining,\n                estimating, elaborating, identifying or testing) that a specific requirement in a\n                standard or procedure is met. A standard or procedure indicates whether the use\n                of a tool is voluntary or mandatory. A voluntary tool cannot be mandatory. Article\n                6.4 mechanism tools include:\n\n                (i)     Policy tool: Supports or is a part of a standard or procedure relating to the\n                        activity cycle, accreditation, the development of methodologies or\n                        standardized baselines, or governance of the Article 6.4 mechanism (which\n                        is not a methodological tool);\n\n                (ii)    Methodological tool: A standardized, stepwise approach to determine or\n                        establish parameters, or identify information, and/or demonstrate\n                        requirements relating to, or for application in, Article 6.4 mechanism\n                        activities;\n\n         (d)    Guidelines: A guideline contains supplemental information such as recommended\n                methods for satisfying requirements identified in the RMP or standards and\n                procedures issued by the Supervisory Body or best practice examples. Guidelines\n                are designed to promote a uniform approach to compliance with the applicable\n                standards or procedures;\n\n\n\n5   ‘Emission reductions’ – Reducing emissions, increasing removals and mitigation co-benefits of\n    adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans are collectively referred to as ‘emission\n    reductions’ in this document.\n\n\n\n                                                 6 of 10\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-005\nDecision and documentation framework\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n       (e)    Clarifications: A clarification is issued to alleviate confusion relating to the\n              application of requirements in a regulatory standard or procedure. Two types of\n              clarifications are issued by the Supervisory Body:\n\n              (i)    Policy clarification: A policy clarification is published as an annex to the\n                     report of a Supervisory Body meeting. It does not change the scope of the\n                     requirement(s) that it is clarifying. A policy clarification is transitory in nature,\n                     pending the subsequent revision of the related policy standard or procedure\n                     which takes into account and incorporates the clarification;\n\n              (ii)   Methodological clarification: A clarification issued in response to an\n                     activity participant(s), DOE or other stakeholder wishing to seek clarification\n                     on a methodology, standardized baseline, or a methodological tool. A\n                     methodological clarification is issued in accordance with the relevant\n                     procedure;\n\n       (f)    Information notes: An information note contains factual and/or analytical\n              information on a particular subject matter relating to the Article 6.4 mechanism\n              rules and requirements, rulings of the Supervisory Body (that is, the reasons for\n              the decision), or the functioning of the Supervisory Body and its support structure.\n              Information notes do not contain requirements and may be published as annexes\n              to the Supervisory Body meeting annotated agendas or reports, and/or directly in\n              the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website in cases where\n              the secretariat is mandated to produce such notes;\n\n       (g)    Forms: Forms are used to capture data or information required in Article 6.4\n              mechanism processes. A form contains pre-defined fields to be filled in by activity\n              participants, AEs/DOEs or DNAs. Completing and submitting forms is part of a\n              series of actions (how to) required by the RMP, or a standard or procedure issued\n              by the Supervisory Body. Forms are published directly in the Article 6.4\n              Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website;\n\n       (h)    Glossaries: A glossary is an alphabetical list of terms relating to the Article 6.4\n              mechanism issued by the Supervisory Body to facilitate a common understanding\n              of terminology used in documentation of the Article 6.4 mechanism;\n\n       (i)    Recommendations: A recommendation is a document recommending, endorsing\n              or supporting a course of action. Recommendations from support structures to the\n              Supervisory Body are published as annexes to the meeting reports of the support\n              structure, or directly published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the\n              UNFCCC website. Recommendations from the Supervisory Body to the CMA may\n              be published as annexes to the meeting reports of the Supervisory Body and are\n              included in the Supervisory Body’s annual report to the CMA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7 of 10\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-005\nDecision and documentation framework\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Control and limitation of documents issued by the\n       Supervisory Body\n10.    When considering issuing a new document or revising and existing document, the\n       Supervisory Body keeps in mind the priority to consolidate, streamline and ensure\n       consistency of all its documentation.\n\n11.    Documents issued by the Supervisory Body, with the exception of methodological tools,\n       can be amended as described below:\n\n       (a)    Substantive revision: When substantive changes are made to a document, the\n              document is replaced with a new document version and issued with a new primary\n              version number;\n\n              Example: Version 2.0 of a document is replaced by version 3.0, where the number\n              “3” indicates a substantive change to the information contained in the document.\n\n       (b)    Corrective or editorial revisions: Corrections or editorial changes do not\n              constitute a substantive revision to the document. When corrections or editorial\n\n\n\n\n                                           9 of 10\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-005\nDecision and documentation framework\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                   changes are made to a document, the document is re-issued under the same\n                   primary version number;\n\n                   Example: Version 2.0 of a document is replaced by version 2.1, where the number\n                   “1” indicates a revision due to corrections or editorial changes.\n\n           (c)     Withdrawal: Documents are withdrawn from active circulation when the\n                   information they contain is no longer applicable, relevant, or correct.\n\n12.        To increase transparency and ensure that users are aware of the latest versions of the\n           Supervisory Body’s regulatory documentation:\n\n           (a)     The version containing substantive changes will be recorded in and annexed to the\n                   meeting report of the Supervisory Body and published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory\n                   Body section of the UNFCCC website. The latest version of the document becomes\n                   effective; unless otherwise stated in the meeting report or in the document itself,\n                   on the date of publication of the meeting report in which the document was revised;\n\n           (b)     The version containing the changes of a corrective or editorial nature will be\n                   published in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the UNFCCC website and\n                   will become applicable on the date of publication. Documents having undergone\n                   corrective or editorial revisions will be noted in the next meeting report of the\n                   Supervisory Body. Unless otherwise stated in the revised document, a grace\n                   period will apply between the date of publication of the version containing the\n                   corrective or editorial revisions in the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body section of the\n                   UNFCCC website and the official notification of the corrective or editorial revisions\n                   in the next meeting report of the Supervisory Body;\n\n           (c)     Stakeholders are encouraged to regularly review the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body\n                   section of the UNFCCC website to ensure that they have the latest versions of\n                   documents, especially for forms that are required as part of a submission process\n                   in the Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle.\n\n13.        Each published Supervisory Body document includes on its last page a “Document\n           information” box which contains contextual information, including the nature and date of\n           changes made to the document. Readers should routinely consult this information when\n           making use of a document.\n\n                                                      -----\n\n\n                                         Document information\n\n Version         Date                   Description\n\n\n      01.0              10 March 2023                            SB 004 Annex 4\n                                                                 Initial adoption.\n Decision Class: Operational\n Document Type: Information note\n Business Function: Governance\n Keywords: management of official documentation, transparency\n\n\n\n\n                                                      10 of 10\n"

Introduction\n1.        Article 6 of the Paris Agreement1 established three instruments for Parties to use in\n          pursuing voluntary cooperation when implementing their nationally determined\n          contributions (NDCs): cooperative approaches involving the use of internationally\n          transferred mitigation outcomes (Article 6, paragraph 2); a mechanism to contribute to the\n          mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6,\n          paragraph 4); and non-market approaches to enable cooperation on mitigation,\n          adaptation, and the development of clean energy sources (Article 6, paragraph 8).\n\n2.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA) adopted, at its third meeting, the “Rules, modalities and procedures for\n          the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”.2 This\n          “rulebook” delineates principles, key requirements and processes of the mechanism\n          established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism),\n          including the establishment of a Supervisory Body. The CMA requested the Supervisory\n          Body to consider and further develop various elements in the rules, modalities and\n          procedures for its operationalization.\n\n3.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol\n          (CMP) decided, through its decision 2/CMP.16,3 to authorize the transfer of USD 30 million\n          from the Trust Fund for the Clean Development Mechanism to the Trust Fund for\n          Supplementary Activities to facilitate the expedited implementation of the Article 6.4\n          mechanism by the Supervisory Body.\n\n4.        The Resource Allocation Plan 2024–2025 (RAP 2024–2025) provides an estimated\n          budget for the Supervisory Body to carry out its work in 2024–2025 as specified in its\n          workplan, as well as other activities deemed essential to operationalize the Article 6.4\n          mechanism.\n\n2.        Strategic vision and goals\n5.        The strategic vision of the Supervisory Body is to provide a mechanism that actively\n          contributes to the global mitigation of emissions and sustainable development, as\n          mandated in Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement. It aims do this through a high-\n          quality, robust, and inclusive multilateral crediting mechanism that demonstrates the\n          highest environmental integrity standards and by aiming to become a benchmark-setter.\n\n6.        To support the achievement of the RAP 2024–2025, the Supervisory Body will strive to\n          accomplish the goals described in the following:\n\n\n\n\n1\n     Paris Agreement available at: https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-\n     change-conference-november-2015/paris-agreement.\n2\n     See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 (decision 3/CMA.3) available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.\n3\n     See document FCCC/KP/CMP/2021/8/Add.1 (decision 2/CMP.16) available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/documents/460957.\n\n\n\n                                                 3 of 18\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-007\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n2.1    Goal 1: Facilitate the implementation of mitigation activities through the\n       prompt operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing and\n       adopting efficient and effective procedures, processes and infrastructure\n7.     Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n       (a)     Operate efficient activity assessment processes with a focus on meeting all\n               timelines without compromising the quality of assessments;\n\n       (b)     Operate an effective accreditation framework through the development of\n               accreditation standards and procedures that are clear and easy to apply while\n               ensuring the broadest possible regional availability of designated operational\n               entities (DOEs);\n\n       (c)     Provide effective and user-friendly infrastructure that facilitates the participation of\n               public and private entities in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by\n               enabling access and ease of use;\n\n       (d)     Continuously review and improve the procedures, processes and infrastructure for\n               the Article 6.4 mechanism in a nimble manner as both a driver of innovation and\n               by being responsive to innovation and best practices as they emerge in the carbon\n               credit markets.\n\n2.2    Goal 2: Set the global benchmark for high environmental integrity in the\n       quantification of mitigation outcomes from activities\n8.     Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n\n       (a)     Operate an effective methodology development process that supports the needed\n               transformational change, and facilitate the achievement of ambitious emission\n               reductions and enhancements of long-term removals;\n\n       (b)     Engage the best expert knowledge by applying a science- and evidence-based\n               approach;\n\n       (c)     Ensure transparent and inclusive processes for the engagement of stakeholders\n               and local communities;\n\n       (d)     Take a leading role in the discussions on environmental integrity standards for\n               carbon crediting through outreach and engagement with other crediting standards\n               and initiatives.\n\n2.3    Goal 3: Enable Party and non-Party stakeholders to understand and\n       participate in the Article 6.4 mechanism\n9.     Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n\n       (a)     Support the highest quality of submissions through the development and\n               strengthening of designated national authorities, DOEs, activity participants, and\n               other stakeholders’ capacity and skills regarding the requirements of the Article 6.4\n               mechanism;\n\n       (b)     Present and protect a positive image of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing\n               and proactively disseminating information and materials that promote awareness\n               of the Article 6.4 mechanism and its benefits;\n\n\n\n                                               4 of 18\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-007\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (c)     Empower host Parties to use the Article 6.4 mechanism as part of their national\n               approaches to support the achievement of ambitious NDCs and long-term low-\n               emission development strategies by promoting greater understanding of how the\n               Article 6.4 mechanism works in their interests.\n\n2.4    Goal 4: Ensure that the Article 6.4 mechanism achieves an equitable regional\n       distribution of Article 6.4 activities and an equitable sharing in benefits from\n       those activities\n10.    Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n\n       (a)     Promote the regional distribution of Article 6.4 activities and ensure that no Party\n               is left behind by ensuring the adaptability of the Article 6.4 mechanism to local\n               conditions and actively engaging with potential host Parties through the provision\n               of support by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n               Regional Collaboration Centres, including by the facilitation of market access;\n\n       (b)     Promote the broadest possible participation and ensure that benefits are shared\n               by all, taking into consideration the interests of host Parties, public and private\n               investors, and the users of the Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions\n               (A6.4ERs).\n\n2.5    Goal 5: Nurture the demand for Article 6.4 emission reductions from the\n       Article 6.4 mechanism\n11.    Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n\n       (a)     Engage with regulatory authorities and other entities on the use of authorized\n               A6.4ERs for NDC achievement by showcasing the potential of the Article 6.4\n               mechanism to supply the highest quality credits while ensuring that double-\n               counting is avoided;\n\n       (b)     Take the necessary steps to ensure that the Article 6.4 mechanism is a leading\n               supplier of mitigation outcomes for use in other international mitigation purposes,\n               specifically through direct engagement with existing regulatory and national bodies\n               and with any future market-based mechanism that may be developed;\n\n       (c)     Engage with public and private stakeholders using mitigation contribution units\n               (MCUs) for national policy and voluntary purposes by promoting the use of MCUs\n               for reporting on the climate impact of activities financed through the purchase and\n               voluntary cancellation of MCUs as results-based finance; and/or engage with\n               public and private entities contributing to the achievement of the host Party’s NDC.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5 of 18\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-007\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix.                      Resource allocation plan 2024–2025\n\n1.        Introduction\n1.         This Resource Allocation Plan 2024–2025 (RAP 2024–2025) outlines the activities and\n           resource requirements needed to support the Supervisory Body’s goals for 2024 and 2025\n           under the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement\n           (Article 6.4 mechanism).\n\n2.

The purpose of TCO charges is to ensure the allocation of costs of these support\n       services to the sources of funding to which they relate. In 2024 and 2025, the TCO charge per capita of EUR\n       15,460 will be applied.\n (k)   Engagement agreement (Information Technology) includes IT-related costs to support the implementation of the\n       Resource Allocation Plan, including the development and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the\n       Article 6.4 mechanism information system.\n (l)   Programme support costs (PSC) – In accordance with the financial procedures of the United Nations, 13 per cent\n       of overhead charges are payable on all trust funds of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\n       Change (UNFCCC) to cover administrative services provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva and the\n       UNFCCC secretariat.\n\n7.         For 2024 and 2025, the estimate for staffing needs are 52 staff and 63 staff, respectively.\n           The increase in proposed staff costs, compared to the indicative budgets, mainly reflects\n           the rise in statutory costs. The secretariat applies the United Nations rules governing\n           salaries and employee benefits. Salary and common costs for staff on fixed-term contracts\n           are calculated using standard rates for each grade. The United Nations Framework\n           Convention on Climate Change rates are determined based on a historical analysis of a\n           set of staff cost parameters such as pay scales and employee benefits. This resulted in a\n           change in standard salary staff rates for all levels.\n\n8.         The consultants cost category in the budget proposals is indicative.\n\n9.         The increase in travel of representatives is primarily due to the addition of costs related to\n           the participation of representatives in the designated national authority regional forums.\n\n10.        The increase in travel of representatives — Supervisory Body is due to the addition of\n           costs related to the participation of two members to the Regional Climate Weeks.\n\n11.        The increase in the travel of staff budget also reflects a general increase in travel costs.\n\n12.        The increase in operating expenses is due to additional costs for regional forums.\n\n13.        The training cost category in the budget proposals is indicative.\n14.        The increased engagement agreement (IT) cost category in the budget proposals,\n           compared to the indicative budgets, reflects the development cost of IT systems such as\n           the development and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the Article 6.4\n           mechanism information system. IT development costs for 2024–2025 are initial estimates\n\n\n\n                                                         17 of 18\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-007\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n           and are likely to increase during 2024–2025, taking into account increased clarity on\n           business requirements (scope and scale of development needed), and may require\n           budget adjustments.\n\n4.         Ensuring the prudent management of resources\n\n15.        The secretariat prudently manages and monitors resource allocations against priority\n           areas of work to ensure the optimal use of available staff in delivering high-quality products\n           on time.\n\n16.        A total of 52 posts are included in the RAP for 2024, and 63 posts are included for 2025,\n           compared to 33 posts in 2023. The proposed RAP estimates a resource need of 550\n           person-months (roughly equivalent to 52 staff) in 2024 and 664 person-months (about\n           63 staff) in 2025 to execute the proposed activities.\n\n17.        The Supervisory Body will have opportunities to review the implementation of its RAP\n           2024–2025 and adjust the allocation of resources as appropriate, considering relevant\n           decisions made by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to\n           the Paris Agreement.\n\n                                                  -----\n\n\n                                         Document information\n\n Version                  Date                  Description\n\n\n 01.0                     14 September 2023     SB 007, Annex 1.\n                                                Initial adoption.\n Decision Class: Operational\n Document Type: Information note\n Business Function: Governance\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, budget, resources management, work programme\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18 of 18\n"

Introduction\n1.       The support structure of the Supervisory Body (SBM) of the Article 6.4 mechanism,\n         consisting of the Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP) and Methodological Expert Panel\n         (MEP), is established under the Supervisory Body to assist in the performance of its\n         functions related to the accreditation system and methodological issues concerning\n         Article 6.4 mechanism activities.\n2.       The mandates of the panels are determined by their terms of reference, the rules of\n         procedure of the Supervisory Body, and additional guidance provided by the Supervisory\n         Body.\n3.       The 2025 workplan of the AEP outlines the expected tasks / products for consideration at\n         each meeting throughout the year in support of the work of the Supervisory Body. It has\n         been developed within the context of the Article 6.4 mechanism’s two-year business and\n         resource allocation plan 2024–2025.1 The workplan includes routine operational activities\n         as well as mandates from the Supervisory Body.\n4.       The AEP workplan for 2025 was approved by the Supervisory Body (refer to annex 3 of\n         SBM 015 meeting report). The AEP co-chairs have agreed to cancel the virtual AEP\n         meeting (AEP 004), which was tentatively scheduled for 15 April 2025. The next AEP\n         meeting, currently set for 2 - 3 July 2025, will now be designated as AEP 004.\n\n\n\n\n1    Information note: Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025\n     (A6.4-INFO-GOV-007).

Introduction\n1.       The support structure of the Supervisory Body (SBM) of the Article 6.4 mechanism,\n         consisting of the Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP) and Methodological Expert Panel\n         (MEP), is established under the Supervisory Body to assist in the performance of its\n         functions related to the accreditation system and methodological issues concerning\n         Article 6.4 mechanism activities.\n2.       The mandates of the panels are determined by their terms of reference, the rules of\n         procedure of the Supervisory Body, and additional guidance provided by the Supervisory\n         Body.\n3.       The 2025 workplan of the MEP outlines the expected tasks / products for consideration at\n         each meeting throughout the year in support of the work of the Supervisory Body. It has\n         been developed within the context of the Article 6.4 mechanism’s two-year business and\n         resource allocation plan 2024–20251 and the “Information note: Further work on the\n         methodological products”2, as considered by the Supervisory Body at its 15th meeting\n         (SBM 015). The workplan includes routine operational activities as well as mandates from\n         the Supervisory Body.\n4.       The secretariat will update the workplan to include any new mandates from the\n         Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n1    Information note: Article 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2024–2025\n     (A6.4-INFO-GOV-007).

At SB 011, the\n    Supervisory Body took note of the report from AEP 001, which included the selection of the ARoE.\n\n    According to paragraph 32 of the report of the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body, 30 clean development mechanism (CDM) designated operational\n    entities (DOEs) are authorized to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism. Three\n    CDM DOEs withdrew their CDM accreditation status after the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body; therefore, 27 CDM DOEs are allowed to verify and\n    certify transitioned CDM activities and their current status has been updated on the Article 6.4 public website. A total of 14 applications for initial accreditation\n    under the Article 6.4 mechanism were received and are currently undergoing processing in accordance with the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation\n    procedure8 adopted at SB 008. Overall, 41 entities are under administration, which is higher than the forecasted value due to the implementation of the SB\n    008 decision which authorized 30 CDM DOEs to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities to the Article 6.4\n    mechanism without conducting an accreditation assessment. Due to the same decision, the actual value of assessment planning is 14 which is less than the\n    forecasted value. During the reporting period, there were no complaints or requests for review raised in accordance with the Article 6.4 accreditation\n    procedure.\n\n    The DOE performance monitoring procedure was considered at AEP 002 and subsequently adopted at SBM 014. 9 Therefore, the performance monitoring\n    system will be implemented once submissions are received.\n\n\n\n\n8    Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation (A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001) available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf.\n9    At SB 011, the Supervisory Body adopted ‘SBM’ (with \"M\" signifying \"of the Mechanism\") to refer to its meetings.\n\n\n\n                                                                                   5 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\nTable 2.

Submissions of new methodologies are expected to start in 2025, following the approval by the Supervisory Body and\n endorsement of the Methodologies and Removal Standards 11 by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement\n (CMA). Requests for clarification, deviation from, and revision of methodologies will commence once CDM methodologies transition to the Article 6.4\n mechanism, tentatively scheduled to start in 2025.\n\n At its first meeting (MEP 001), the Methodologies Expert Panel (MEP) considered 29 items 12 and launched a call for public input on the revision of two CDM\n methodologies and a methodological tool13 for their application under the Article 6.4 mechanism. During MEP 001, the MEP agreed to launch a call for public\n\n11   See Standard “Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf and the Standard “Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4\n     mechanism” https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf.\n12   See the MEP 001 meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-MEP001.pdf.\n13   ACM0001: Flaring or use of landfill gas, ACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources, and TOOL07.\n\n\n\n                                                                                13 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n inputs on “ACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources” and “TOOL07: Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity\n system” to gather stakeholder feedback for potential revisions applicable to the Article 6.4 mechanism. The MEP will continue to consider revisions to the\n methodology and TOOL07 based on stakeholder feedback at the next meeting in 2025. Additionally, it launched a call for public input on “ACM0001: Flaring\n or use of landfill gas”.\n\n During its second meeting (MEP 002), the MEP considered 31 items 14 and launched a call for public input on the standard for demonstration of additionality in\n mechanism methodologies.15 The MEP also prioritized work on the standards for setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies; demonstration of\n additionality in mechanism methodologies; and addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies. MEP 003 also prioritized developing a concept note on\n large-scale crediting methodologies, and revision of 12 CDM methodologies and tools. The guidance developed under these standards and tools could\n potentially impact the further development of other products.\n\n During its third meeting (MEP 003), the MEP considered 20 items16 and the MEP finalized the draft “Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism\n methodologies” and agreed to launch a call for public inputs. The MEP will update the aforementioned baseline standard, taking into account the inputs\n received, with the aim to make a recommendation to the Supervisory Body at a future meeting in 2025.\n\n At SB 011, an update on the preparations related to engaging with Parties and stakeholders during the UNFCCC sessions in June 2024 in Bonn was\n discussed to facilitate the work on documents developed by the Supervisory Body at SB 009, namely, A6.4-SB009-A01: “Requirements for the development\n and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” and A6.4-SB009-A02: “Activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”. Guidance\n was provided by the Supervisory Body to the secretariat in this regard.\n\n At SBM 012, the Supervisory Body considered the information notes “Compilation and analysis of stakeholder inputs on the requirements for Article 6.4\n methodologies” and “Compilation and summary of stakeholder inputs on activities involving removals under Article 6.4 mechanism.” The secretariat was\n requested to update these notes based on inputs received at the Supervisory Body’s engagement event at the sixtieth session of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB\n 60) and feedback provided during SBM 012. Subsequently, an information note was prepared for SBM 013.\n\n Regarding support for methodological work and other technical documents, non-staff costs included increased support from consultants to draft Article 6.4\n mechanism methodologies and revise CDM methodologies.\n\n\n\n14   See the MEP 002 meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-MEP002.pdf.\n15   See the call for input available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-64-mechanism/calls-for-input/2024-demonstration-\n     additionality.\n16   See the MEP 003 meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-MEP003%20meeting%20report.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                                              14 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n RCCs provided onsite support to 25 project developers (four in Asia-Pacific, seven in East and Southern Africa, five in Latin America, five in Middle East and\n North Africa, and four in West and Central Africa) regarding transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the role and responsibilities of Article 6.4 DNAs, and\n corresponding adjustments for Article 6.4 activities.

The secretariat also highlighted the possible need for an interim solution in case of any administrative delays related\n to the procurement process. The Supervisory Body requested the secretariat to prepare a procedure for the mechanism registry covering certain elements.\n\n At SB 011, the Supervisory Body considered the draft procedure “A6.4 mechanism registry” and requested the secretariat to evaluate and incorporate the\n following aspects: (a) Transaction rules; (b) Provisions for real-time transparency and interoperability of publicly accessible information, based on best\n practices; (c) Options for the fee schedule; (d) Improvements to document consistency and references, including the necessary references to CMA 3 and\n CMA 4 guidance; (e) Identification of areas pending guidance from the CMA and/or the Supervisory Body, as applicable; (f) Tabular, graphical and other\n visual representations of the transaction rules, accounts and unit life cycles (including the treatment of mitigation contribution units and authorized A6.4\n emission reductions that are user-friendly.\n\n The draft procedure for operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry was considered again by the Supervisory Body at its thirteenth meeting, and it\n requested the secretariat to further develop the draft procedure for consideration at a future meeting, taking into account the guidance provided at the\n meeting.

At SB 011, the Supervisory Body\n finalized and adopted the procedure “Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”, reinforcing the protection of environmental and\n social human rights. The Supervisory Body further requested the secretariat to elaborate a user-friendly explanatory note on the application of the adopted\n procedure “Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and to make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n At SB 011, the Supervisory Body considered the draft tool “Article 6.4 sustainable development tool” (A6.4 SD tool) and requested the secretariat to work\n further on the draft tool in consultation with the informal working group for this matter between that meeting and SBM 013 with the aim of adopting the draft\n\n17   See document here https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64_SB010_aa_an03.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                                            18 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                             Approved non-\n                                                                                     Forecasted\n                                                                                                         Actual volume       staff costs         Actual\n Outputs                   Goals    Activities                      Units            volume\n                                                                                                                             (USD)\n                                                                                     2024                 December 2024 2024                  December 2024\n tool at SBM 013, and to launch a focused call for inputs on the draft A6.4 SD tool, particularly from the CDM DOEs and the validation and verification bodies\n of other market mechanisms.\n\n At SBM 013, the Supervisory Body considered the draft A6.4 SD tool and requested the secretariat to further work on the draft tool in consultation with an\n informal working group for this matter. At SBM 014, the Supervisory Body adopted the “Article 6.4 sustainable development tool” and requested the secretariat\n to prepare the respective forms referred to in the A6.4 SD tool, e.g. A6.4 Environmental and Social Safeguards Risk Assessment Form; A6.4 Sustainable\n Development Tool Form; and A6.4 Environmental and Social Management Plan Form. The Supervisory Body agreed that the A6.4 SD tool shall become\n mandatory to apply to CDM project activities, or PoAs and component project activities, or PoAs and Clean Production Agreements therein, that may\n transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism when the forms are made publicly available on the website.\n\n At SB 011, the Supervisory Body also considered the concept note “Development of activity standard, validation and verification standard, and activity cycle\n procedure for programmes of activities”, the draft procedure “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”, the draft standard “Article 6.4\n activity standard for programmes of activities” and the draft standard “Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities”, and\n provided guidance to these draft regulatory documents for PoAs. Subsequently, the Supervisory Body launched a call for public inputs on the aforementioned\n draft procedure and standards, and requested the secretariat to revise the documents, taking into account the public inputs. At SBM 013, the Supervisory\n Body adopted the procedure and standards for PoAs thus establishing the regulatory framework for programmes of activities under the Article 6.4\n mechanism.18\n At SBM 013, the Supervisory Body adopted the revised procedure for transition of the CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism in order to provide flexibility\n for the transition of multi-country CDM PoAs to the Article 6.4 mechanism and provisions for revising and withdrawing a transition request.\n\n At SBM 014, the Supervisory Body adopted the procedure “Direct communication with stakeholders” that replaces the “Procedure: Consideration of\n unsolicited letters to the Supervisory Body”, which was adopted by the Supervisory Body at SB 004.\n\n At SBM 014, the Supervisory Body adopted the procedure “Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities” and noted that the\n secretariat will publish the DOE performance monitoring reports in accordance with the timelines as specified in the procedure.

Other capacity-building activities,19 including webinars, country support, workshops, and training sessions, were organized across different\n regions.\n Targeted capacity-building support, including through RCCs, in the form of webinars, in-country support, and event presentations has focused on various\n aspects of Article 6 operationalization and engagement, roles and responsibilities of Parties and DNAs, framework and strategy development, and\n\n\n19   For details of activities, see information note available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2024_inf01.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                                                 26 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                         Approved non-\n                                                                                   Forecasted\n                                                                                                      Actual volume      staff costs         Actual\n Outputs                  Goals    Activities                    Units             volume\n                                                                                                                         (USD)\n                                                                                    2024                December 2024 2024                    December 2024\n project/programme development under Article 6. The Article 6 Capacity Building Team, together with the other substantive teams, developed a user-friendly\n manual20 for host Parties’ participation in the Article 6.4 mechanism. The manual was finalized in December 2024 and will be launched in early 2025.\n\n Furthermore, to reduce fragmentation of capacity-building efforts and synergize for greater operational efficiency and impact, various partnerships for\n implementing capacity-building programmes have been developed. A strategic collaboration has been established with the Institute for Global Environmental\n Strategies under the “Article 6 Implementation Partnership”. Efforts are also underway to establish similar partnerships with other stakeholders, including\n United Nations University, Africa Carbon Markets Initiative and the World Bank, among others, to leverage technical expertise and knowledge in delivering\n regional workshops on Article 6 and Carbon Pricing planned in 2025, and other capacity-building products developed by the secretariat.\n\n\n\n\n20   For more information, see document A6.4-SBM015-AA-A04 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A64-SBM015-AA-A04.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                                           27 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\nTable 12.

Issues included both general and substantive inquiries addressed to the secretariat and\n Supervisory Body. Topics covered transitions of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism, clarifications on rules and regulations adopted by the\n Supervisory Body, prior notifications consideration, and fulfilment of host Party participation requirements, among others. Additionally, five unsolicited letters\n were considered during the SB 011, namely: (a) two from Parties and groups of Parties: Honduras (on behalf of the Coalition of Rainforest Nations) and\n Zambia; (b) one from a UNFCCC constituted body: a letter from the co-chairs of the Standing Committee on Finance; and (c) two from other stakeholders: C-\n Quest Capital21 and 44-Moles.22 Furthermore, the secretariat responded to one letter from a stakeholder regarding the handling of inputs related to the draft\n Sustainable Development Tool and draft Appeal and Grievance procedure.\n\n Twenty-eight observers, including Parties, were registered to interact with the Supervisory Body during the tenth, eleventh, thirteenth and fourteenth meetings\n on issues included in the annotated agenda and related annexes of each of its meeting.\n\n During the reporting period 13 calls for inputs were launched on various topics, resulting in a total of 176 inputs received from a wide range of stakeholders.\n At SB 010, the Supervisory Body agreed to establish a forum of the Article 6.4 DNAs, to support the implementation of the Article 6.4 mechanism, and to\n facilitate a dialogue with host Parties. As part of the mandate to organize regular interaction with the Article 6.4 DNAs, the secretariat held a webinar on the\n Article 6.4 implementation update for DNAs on 21 May 2024, which focused on providing updates on the work of the Supervisory Body, regulatory frameworks\n for projects, transition and roles and responsibilities of host Parties.\n\n\n21   See https://cquestcapital.com for more information.\n22   See https://44moles.com for more information.\n\n\n\n                                                                                  29 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation (1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n As part of the secretariat interactions with stakeholders, the secretariat reached out twice to all Parties to the Paris Agreement to designate and communicate\n their national authority for the Article 6.4 mechanism. Accordingly, 97 Parties have designated their national authority thus far.\n\n In addition, the secretariat communicated all eligible CDM activities, including more than 1,600 projects and PoAs that have requested transition, to relevant\n DNAs, copying UNFCCC national focal points, along with the request to fulfil the requirements related to the host Party participation and host Party approval\n for these projects. Ten Parties – Benin, Bhutan, Dominican Republic, Ghana, India, Mali, Morocco, Myanmar, Togo and Uganda – have communicated their\n host Party participation requirements to the Supervisory Body.\n\n With the adoption of the procedure “Direct communication with stakeholders”, the Supervisory Body continued to enhance its engagement with stakeholders.\n In addition, based on the mandate from the SBM 013, the secretariat is currently developing a user-friendly manual on the roles and responsibilities of host\n Parties to facilitate their engagement in the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n As for the Nairobi Framework Partnership coordination and technical support to stakeholders and regional engagement, as well as capacity-building of DOEs,\n the related activities are scheduled to commence in Q1 and Q2 2025.\n\n The RCCs continued identifying and assessing key regional actors that support capacity-building, training, and knowledge-sharing activities related to Article\n 6. This mapping efforts help to understand existing initiatives, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration, ensuring more effective partnerships. A total of 139\n interactions took place, on the margins of 98 capacity-building events on Article 6 organized by the secretariat or external stakeholders.

The secretariat has continued to prudently manage and monitor the resource allocation against priority areas of work to ensure\n the full utilization of available staff in delivering high-quality products on time.\n\n Inputs on the Article 6.4 budget were provided during the reporting period for the secretariat’s budget performance report 2022–2023 and work programme\n 2024–2025.\n\n In Q3 2024, the Internal Service Agreement between the Mitigation and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) divisions was signed. The\n agreement covers the ICT services to support a wide range of activities under the Supervisory Body’s workplan, including ICT services for Supervisory Body\n meetings, stakeholder interactions, MIS, and Article 6.4 Registry for 2024 and 2025.\n\n The information note “Status of Article 6.4 mechanism Resource Allocation Plan 2024-25 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2024)” was submitted to the\n Supervisory Body at SBM 014. In Q4 2024, work began to finalize the end-year review report covering the period 1 January – 31 December 2024 on the\n status of implementation of the RAP 2024–2025.\n\n Actual subscriptions include online portals offering recent intelligence on carbon pricing and climate change policies, as well as newsletter online services for\n Article 6.4 communications.\n\n In accordance with paragraph 16 of the UNFCCC financial procedures contained in Annex I of decision 15/CP.1, and further to decision 7/CMA.4, paragraph\n 27, at the beginning of 2024, the secretariat took steps to establish a separate trust fund for the receipt of the shares of proceeds to cover expenses relating to\n the administration of the Article 6.4 mechanism and to administer other contributions, including the share of proceeds to assist developing country Parties that\n are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation. The Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism Trust Fund\n has been established by the United Nations Secretary-General. It will be administered in conformity with the UNFCCC Financial procedures and the United\n Nations Financial Regulations and Rules and will be managed by the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC secretariat.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              37 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation\n(1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n2.2.

Column (d) in table 15 shows the rate of expenditure as a percentage against the 2024\n        budget for each cost category. The total rate of expenditure (56.6 per cent) is below the\n        linear rate of expenditure (100 percent) for the reporting period.\n7.      Staff costs amount to 60.7 per cent of the 2024 budget for this object of expenditure which\n        is significantly lower than the linear rate of 100 per cent. The lower rate is due to the timing\n        between the selection and onboarding of recruited staff and due to prudent resource\n        management including capitalizing on the synergies with human resources supporting\n        other areas of work.\n8.      Consultant costs amount to 140.0 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of\n        expenditure, which is higher than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The\n        higher expenditure rate is due to obligations (48 per cent of the total consumed USD 733,\n        812) for which the services are to be received in 2025.\n9.      The expert fees amount to 27.3 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of\n        expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per\n        cent). This reflects the fees for the two meetings of the AEP and three meetings of the\n        MEP processed in the period.\n10.     Expert travel amounts to 58.3 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object of\n        expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per\n        cent). This represents travel costs of the in-person meetings of the panels and working\n        groups in 2024.\n11.     With regard to travel of representatives, there were no meetings, workshops or other\n        events during the reporting period.\n12.     Travel of Supervisory Body members amounts to 39.8 per cent of the projected 2024\n        budget for this object of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of\n        expenditure (100 per cent). This represents the cost of the in-person meetings of the\n        regulatory body.\n13.     Travel of staff amounts to 36.4 per cent of the 2024 budget for this object of expenditure,\n        which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The lower\n        expenditure reflects reduced staff participation in events outside of Bonn, due to prudent\n        resource management.\n14.     Training costs amount to 19.2 per cent against the projected 2024 budget, which is\n        significantly lower than the linearly projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent). The lower\n        rate is due to prudent resource management.\n15.     Operating expenses amount to 30.7 per cent of the projected 2024 budget for this object\n        of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per\n        cent). This is due to fewer meetings held throughout the year than anticipated.\n16.     Engagement agreement costs, IT-related, costs amount to 52.1 of the 2024 budget for this\n        object of expenditure, which is lower than the projected rate of expenditure (100 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    39 of 40\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-023\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024 implementation\n(1 January – 31 December 2024)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n                                                -----\n\n\n                                      Document information\n\n\n\n Version               Date                   Description\n\n 01.0                  2 May 2025             Initial publication.\n Decision Class: Operational\n Document Type: Information note\n Business Function: Governance\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, budget, reporting procedures, resources management\n\n\n\n\n                                               40 of 40\n"

Introduction\n1.        Article 6 of the Paris Agreement1 established three instruments for Parties to use in\n          pursuing voluntary cooperation when implementing their nationally determined\n          contributions (NDCs): cooperative approaches involving the use of internationally\n          transferred mitigation outcomes (Article 6, paragraph 2); a mechanism to contribute to the\n          mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development (Article 6,\n          paragraph 4); and non-market approaches to enable cooperation on mitigation,\n          adaptation, and the development of clean energy sources (Article 6, paragraph 8).\n2.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA) adopted, at its third meeting, the “Rules, modalities and procedures for\n          the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”.2 This\n          “rulebook” delineates principles, key requirements and processes of the mechanism\n          established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism),\n          including the establishment of a Supervisory Body. The CMA requested the Supervisory\n          Body to consider and further develop various elements in the rules, modalities and\n          procedures for its operationalization.\n3.        At its 14th meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body adopted new\n          standards facilitating the creation, purchase, and sale of carbon credits. These standards\n          outline methodologies for crediting emissions reductions or removals and provide\n          guidance for developing and accessing Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies, with these\n          it ensures transparency, credibility, and the avoidance of leakage, as well as addressing\n          risks in emissions projects. The CMA took note of these developments, marking a\n          significant step toward operationalizing a global carbon market under the Paris\n          Agreement.\n4.        The Resource Allocation Plan 2026–2027 (RAP 2026–2027) presented in this document\n          provides an estimated budget for the Supervisory Body to carry out its work in 2026–2027\n          as specified in its workplan, as well as other activities deemed essential to operationalize\n          the Article 6.4 mechanism. The RAP 2026-2027 takes into consideration the need for\n          flexibility in deploying resources and was prepared noting that the funding shortfall in 2025\n          had required the implementation of contingency measures to limit expenditures to 72.8 %\n          of the initial budget, and that the prudent management of resources will need to continue\n          in the biennium 2026-2027.\n\n2.        Strategic vision and objectives\n5.        The strategic vision of the Supervisory Body is to provide a mechanism that actively\n          contributes to the global mitigation of emissions and sustainable development, as\n          mandated in Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement. It aims do this through a high-\n          quality, robust and inclusive multilateral crediting mechanism that demonstrates the\n          highest environmental integrity standards and by aiming to become a benchmark-setter.\n\n1\n     See document, The Paris Agreement available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/pastconferences/paris-climate-change-conference-november-\n     2015/paris-agreement.\n2\n     See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 (decision 3/CMA.3) available at\n     https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.\n\n\n\n                                                 3 of 23\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n6.     To support the achievement of the RAP 2026–2027, the Supervisory Body will strive to\n       accomplish the following objectives and related goals:\n\n2.1    Objective 1: Prompt operationalization of the Article 6.4 mechanism as a\n       global benchmark for high-integrity carbon credits\n7.     The Supervisory Body intends to focus its primary efforts on getting the Article 6.4\n       mechanism operational and “open-for-business” so that it can take its place as the only\n       multilaterally agreed and governed crediting mechanism that can be the global benchmark\n       for high integrity carbon credits. Once achieved, this objective will evolve into one focused\n       on maintaining the operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism and that it remains ‘fit-for-\n       purpose’.\n\n2.1.1 Goal 1: Develop and adopt efficient and effective procedures, processes, and\n      infrastructure\n8.     Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n       (a)     Operate efficient activity assessment processes with a focus on meeting all\n               timelines without compromising the quality of assessments;\n       (b)     Operate an effective accreditation framework through the development of\n               accreditation standards and procedures that are clear and easy to apply while\n               ensuring the broadest possible regional availability of designated operational\n               entities (DOEs);\n       (c)     Provide effective and user-friendly infrastructure that facilitates the participation of\n               public and private entities in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions by\n               enabling access and ease of use;\n       (d)     Continuously review and improve the procedures, processes and infrastructure for\n               the Article 6.4 mechanism in a nimble manner as a driver of innovation and by\n               being responsive to innovation and best practices as they emerge in the carbon\n               credit markets;\n       (e)     Support Parties and stakeholders through the completion of the transition of\n               eligible projects and certified emissions reductions (CERs) from the clean\n               development mechanism to the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n2.1.2 Goal 2: Set the global benchmark for high environmental integrity in the\n      quantification of mitigation outcomes from activities\n9.     Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n       (a)     Operate an effective methodology development process that supports the needed\n               transformational change, and facilitate the achievement of ambitious emission\n               reductions that are real, additional and verifiable as well as enhancements of long-\n               term removals;\n       (b)     Engage the best expert knowledge by applying a science- and evidence-based\n               approach;\n       (c)     Ensure transparent and inclusive processes for the engagement of stakeholders\n               and local communities;\n\n\n\n                                               4 of 23\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n         (d)     Take a leading role in the discussions on environmental integrity and\n                 harmonization of standards for carbon crediting through outreach and engagement\n                 with other crediting standards and initiatives.\n\n2.2      Objective 2: To support the effective utilization of the Article 6.4 mechanism\n         by the full range of stakeholders\n10.      Once the Article 6.4 mechanism is sufficiently operational, the Supervisory Body will\n         increase its focus on enhancing the use of the Article 6.4 mechanism by stakeholders,\n         while noting that some activities will be undertaken to support this objective in parallel with\n         the objective above.\n\n2.2.1 Goal 3: Enable Party and non-Party stakeholders to understand and participate in\n      the Article 6.4 mechanism\n11.      Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n         (a)     Support the highest quality of submissions through the development and\n                 strengthening of the capacity and skills of designated national authorities, DOEs,\n                 activity participants and other stakeholders’ regarding the requirements of the\n                 Article 6.4 mechanism;\n         (b)     Present and protect a positive image of the Article 6.4 mechanism by developing\n                 and proactively disseminating information and materials that promote awareness\n                 of the Article 6.4 mechanism and its benefits;\n         (c)     Empower host Parties to use the Article 6.4 mechanism as part of their national\n                 approaches to support the achievement of ambitious NDCs and long-term low-\n                 emission development strategies by promoting greater understanding of how the\n                 Article 6.4 mechanism works in their interests.\n\n2.2.2 Goal 4: Promote that the Article 6.4 mechanism achieves an equitable regional\n      distribution of Article 6.4 activities and an equitable sharing in benefits from those\n      activities\n12.      Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n         (a)     Promote the regional distribution of Article 6.4 activities and ensure that no Party\n                 is left behind by ensuring (i) the adaptability of the Article 6.4 mechanism to local\n                 conditions, (ii) its usability, and (iii) the minimization of its transaction cost and by\n                 actively engaging with potential host Parties through the provision of support by\n                 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Regional\n                 Collaboration Centres, including by the facilitation of market access;\n         (b)     Promote the broadest possible participation and ensure that benefits are shared\n                 by all, taking into consideration the interests of host Parties, public and private\n                 investors, and the users of the Article 6, paragraph 4, mitigation outcomes\n                 (A6.4ERs (either as MCUs3 or AERs4)).\n\n3   Article 6, paragraph 4, emissions reductions (mitigation contribution A6.4ERs), as per decision 6/CMA.4,\n    annex, paragraph 29(b)\n4   Article 6, paragraph 4, emissions reductions (authorized A6.4ERs), as per decision 6/CMA.4, annex,\n    paragraph 29(a)\n\n\n\n                                                   5 of 23\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Goal 5: Enable demand for Article 6.4 mitigation outcomes from the Article 6.4\n      mechanism\n13.    Under this goal, the Supervisory Body intends to:\n       (a)     Engage with public and private stakeholders using MCUs for national policy and\n               voluntary purposes by promoting the use of MCUs for reporting on the climate\n               impact of activities financed through the purchase and voluntary cancellation of\n               MCUs as results-based finance; and/or engage with public and private entities\n               contributing to the achievement of the host Party’s NDC.\n       (b)     Engage with regulatory authorities and other entities on the use of AERs for NDC\n               achievement by showcasing the potential of the Article 6.4 mechanism to supply\n               the highest-quality credits while ensuring that double-counting is avoided;\n       (c)     Take the necessary steps to ensure that the Article 6.4 mechanism is a leading\n               supplier of mitigation outcomes for use in other international mitigation purposes,\n               specifically through direct engagement with existing regulatory and national bodies\n               and with any future market-based mechanism(s) that may be developed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6 of 23\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix.                      Resource Allocation Plan 2026–2027\n\n1.        Introduction\n1.         This Resource Allocation Plan 2026–2027 (RAP 2026–2027) outlines the activities and\n           resource requirements needed to support the Supervisory Body’s goals for 2026 and 2027\n           under the Article 6.4 mechanism, noting that additional funding will be needed to cover the\n           expenditures for both years, considering the available resources and projected income.\n\n2.        Activities, forecasted volumes and resource requirements\n2.         As shown in table 1, the budget proposal covered by the RAP 2026–2027 is\n           USD 20.8 million for 2026 (column (c)) and USD 17.3 million for 2027 (column (d)),\n           compared to the approved budget for 2024 and 2025 of USD 18.6 million (column (a)) and\n           USD 19.8 million (column (b)) respectively.\n3.         In 2026 and 2027, the proposed staff count is 57 per year.\n\nTable 1.

The purpose of TCO charges is to\n     ensure the allocation of costs of these support services to the sources of funding to which they relate. The TCO charge per capita\n     of EUR 17,290 is applied.\n     PSC – In accordance with the financial procedures of the United Nations, 13 per cent of overhead charges are payable on all trust\n     funds of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to cover administrative services provided by\n     the United Nations Office at Geneva and the UNFCCC secretariat.\n\n\n\n\n                                                               7 of 23\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n4.     Table 2 reflects the level of activities that are envisaged under the planned resource allocation for 2026 and 2027. To deliver the proposed\n       activities and outputs, total estimated resource needs are 603 person-months per year. During the implementation of the RAP 2026–2027,\n       adjustments may be necessary. Other Mitigation Division staff resources may be utilized to support the delivery of outputs as required.

The purpose of TCO charges is to ensure the allocation of costs of these support\n       services to the sources of funding to which they relate. The TCO charge per capita of EUR 17,290 is applied.\n (k)   Engagement agreement (Information Technology) includes IT- related costs to support the implementation of the\n       Resource Allocation Plan, including the development and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the\n       Article 6.4 mechanism information system.\n (l)   Programme support costs (PSC) – In accordance with the financial procedures of the United Nations, 13 per cent\n       of overhead charges are payable on all trust funds of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\n       Change (UNFCCC) to cover administrative services provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva and the\n       UNFCCC secretariat.\n\n7.         The increased engagement agreement (Information Technology (IT)) cost category in the\n           budget proposal for 2026, compared to the approved budgets for 2024 and 2025, reflects\n           the continual development costs of IT systems such as the next phases and operation of\n           the Article 6.4 mechanism registry and the Article 6.4 mechanism information system. IT\n           development costs for 2026–2027 are estimates.\n\n4.         Ensuring the prudent management of resources\n8.         The secretariat will continue to ensure the prudent management and monitoring of\n           resource allocations against priority areas of work to ensure the optimal use of available\n           staff in delivering high-quality products on time.\n9.         The Supervisory Body will have opportunities to review the implementation of its RAP\n           2026–2027 and adjust the allocation of resources as appropriate, considering relevant\n           decisions made by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to\n           the Paris Agreement, as well as the funding status of the mechanism established by\n           Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement.\n\n                                                          -----\n\n\n\n\n                                                         22 of 23\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-024\nArticle 6.4 mechanism two-year business and resource allocation plan 2026–2027\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                                      Document information\n\n Version              Date                   Description\n\n\n 01.0                 7 August 2025          SBM 017, Annex 1.\n                                             Initial adoption\n\n Decision Class: Operational\n Document Type: Information note\n Business Function: Governance\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, budget, resources management\n\n\n\n\n                                              23 of 23\n"

Status of outputs\n5.         As outlined in paragraph 32 of the report3 of the tenth meeting of the Supervisory Body (SB 010), 28 clean development mechanism (CDM)\n           designated operational entities (DOEs) were authorized to verify and certify requests for issuance of transitioned CDM activities. Their\n           current status was updated on the Article 6.4 mechanism public website4 until 30 September 2025.\n6.         In addition, one Article 6.4 DOE was accredited at SBM 015, and 16 applicant entities (AEs) have been undergoing initial accreditation\n           assessments in accordance with accreditation procedure of the Article 6.4 mechanism5 adopted at SB 008.\n7.         A total of 22 entities were under administration, exceeding the estimated volume for the reporting period. However, only four assessments\n           were undertaken, which is below the estimated volume for the reporting period. This is due to the implementation of the above-mentioned\n           SB 010 decision, which allows 28 CDM DOEs to conduct verification and certification of requests for issuance of transitioned activities under\n           the Article 6.4 mechanism without undergoing additional accreditation assessment.\n8.         During the reporting period, there were no complaints or requests for review raised in accordance with the accreditation procedure of Article\n           6.4 mechanism.\n9.         The DOE performance monitoring procedure considered at the second meeting of the Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP 002) and adopted\n           at SBM 014 will be implemented once activity submissions requesting registration and issuance under Article 6.4 mechanism are received.\n\n\n\n\n3\n     Meeting report available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/SB010_report.pdf.\n4\n     https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/accreditation#CDM-DOEs-conducting-verification-of-requests-for-issuance-of-\n     transitioned-activities.\n5\n     Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation (A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001) available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-ACCR-001.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          5 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2.

Regular surveillance will be conducted\n        after the completion of the initial accreditation assessments. Therefore, there was no regular surveillance conducted during this reporting\n        period. Also, as no request for issuance was made for 10 transition requests approved by the Supervisory Body during the reporting period,\n        no performance assessments were launched during the reporting period.\n11.

On the development side:\n       (a)     The work on technical and non-technical requirements was continued as planned;\n\n       (b)     Around 1,235 user stories were developed in areas such as methodologies, accreditation, transition, fee-processing, prior\n               consideration, issuance, modality of communication, registration, and access management, thus guiding the development teams.\n17.    On the operational side:\n\n       (a)     At the end of the reporting period, 107 DNAs had submitted documentation and the secretariat reviewed, stored and published it\n               within the expected timeframes;\n\n\n\n                                                                              9 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (b)     During reporting period, a total of 163 prior consideration notifications were processed and published using dedicated workflows and\n               interfaces for PoAs and project activities. At the end of the reporting period, a total of 1,508 cases had correctly requested transition,\n               and over 1,100 cases notified a prior consideration. All of these cases were integrated into the respective workflows, resulting in a\n               significant workload related to user identity confirmation, as well as documentation validation and assessment;\n\n       (c)     Eight accreditation entities submitted documentation using a dedicated interface;\n\n       (d)     During the reporting period 35 activities (17 project activities (PAs), 18 PoAs) received host Party project approval and 10 of them\n               were registered (five PAs, and five PoAs).\n\n       (e)     To facilitate these activities, solutions, interfaces, and public webpages were developed and utilized for efficient submission\n               management.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         10 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n2.1.5.

Requests for clarification of, deviation from, and revision of\n          methodologies will commence once CDM methodologies transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism, which is tentatively scheduled to start in\n          2026.\n19.       During the fourth meeting of the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP 004), the MEP considered 18 items. The MEP 004 finalized the “Draft\n          Standard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies” and “Draft Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism\n          methodologies” for submission to the Supervisory Body for its review and consideration for approval and/or further mandate to finalize the\n          standards. The MEP also finalized the “Draft Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies” and agreed to launch a call for\n          public inputs on this draft standard. Lastly, the MEP requested mandates from the Supervisory Body to:\n\n          (a)     Initiate work on a methodological tool for “Common practice analysis”;\n\n          (b)     Develop a concept note to analyse potential issues related to activities that are supported through a combination of public funding\n                  and carbon revenues;\n\n6\n     https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-6/article-64-pacm/methodologies#submissions.\n\n\n                                                                              12 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (c)     Initiate work to amend the “Draft Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies” to include methodology\n               requirements for PoAs; and renewal of the crediting period.\n20.    At MEP 005, the MEP considered 20 items and, based on guidance received at SBM 015, further revised and finalized the “Draft Standard:\n       Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies” and the “Draft Standard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies” for\n       submission to the Supervisory Body.\n21.    At MEP 006, the MEP considered 14 items and finalized the draft “Standard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies”\n       and the draft “Concept note: Applicability of removal guidance to emission reduction activities and vice versa” and agreed to seek inputs\n       from stakeholders on both documents.\n22.    Regarding support for methodological work and other technical documents, non-staff costs included increased support from consultants to\n       draft Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies and revise CDM methodologies.\n23.    RCCs provided on-site support to 23 project developers (three in Asia-Pacific, two in the Caribbean, five in East and Southern Africa, six in\n       Latin America, and seven in Middle East and North Africa) regarding transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the role and responsibilities of\n       Article 6.4 mechanism DNAs, and approval and authorization matters relating to Article 6.4 mechanism activities. The number of on-site\n       support instances was four times higher than anticipated, underscoring the continuation of an increased demand from stakeholders.\n24.

Status of outputs\n32.    In the reporting period, eight regulations and procedures were considered at the four Supervisory Body meetings, and in total 67 regulatory\n       documents were developed.\n33.    As outlined in the paragraph 20 and 21 of the meeting report of SBM 014, the secretariat made three forms referred in the A6.4 Sustainable\n       Development (SD) tool, i.e. A6.4 Environmental and Social Safeguards Risk Assessment Form (A6.4-FORM-AC-015), A6.4 Sustainable\n       Development Tool Form (A6.4-FORM-AC-016) and A6.4 Environmental and Social Management Plan Form (A6.4-FORM-AC-016), which\n       have been available since 11 February 2025. Therefore, project participants of CDM activities eligible for transition to the Article 6.4\n       mechanism should have begun to use the A6.4 SD tool starting from 09:00 CET of 11 February 2025.\n34.    At SBM 015, the Supervisory Body considered and adopted the revision to the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” and “Activity cycle\n       procedure for programmes of activities”. The revisions provided procedural background for operationalization of the authorization process\n       and exemption of Article 6.4 mechanism activities hosted in the Least Developing Countries (LDCs) and Small Islands Development States\n       (SIDS) including an option for LDCs and SIDS not to apply this exemption, along with other changes. The Supervisory Body requested the\n       secretariat to elaborate an information note with options for a time limit from the date of issuance to when the host Party shall provide a\n       statement of authorization for post-issuance authorization of the A6.4ERs for consideration at a future meeting of the Supervisory Body\n       based on the experience gained from application of the exemption.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         16 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n35.    At SBM 015, the Supervisory Body considered and adopted the revision to “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4\n       mechanism” and “Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” to provide the procedural basis for transition of CDM\n       Afforestation/Reforestation project activities and PoAs. At SBM 016, the Supervisory Body further revised these documents to include\n       provisions on avoidance of double issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities, and provisions which require the\n       use of re-evaluated values for the fraction of non-renewable biomass and the discount factor for the leakage for activities using CDM\n       methodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission reductions.\n36.    At SBM 016, the Supervisory Body considered and adopted the revisions to the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects”, the\n       “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities”, the “Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for\n       projects” and the “Standard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities”. The revisions incorporated relevant\n       elements which must be followed by activity participants to develop and monitor Article 6.4 projects and PoAs, and by DOEs to validate and\n       verify Article 6.4 projects and PoAs, contained in the “Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the\n       development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”, the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under\n       the Article 6.4 mechanism”, the “Standard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies” and the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable\n       development tool”. The revisions also clarified the eligibility date for the start date of Article 6.4 activities, elaborated aspects related to\n       alternative monitoring and deviation processes for activity participants in case of irremediable negative impacts detected, and reflected the\n       outcomes of the structured editorial and legal review.\n37.    The secretariat conducted the initial structured legal and editorial review of the regulations and procedures approved by the Supervisory\n       Body to ensure consistency among the regulations, including with regard to its Rules of Procedure, as mandated by the Supervisory Body\n       at SB 010. The proposed changes in each document were submitted for consideration and approval by the Supervisory Body. In addition,\n       at SBM 016, the Supervisory Body adopted the procedure \"Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory\n       Body’s regulatory documents\".\n38.    For regulatory documents related to governance matters, at SBM 015, the Supervisory Body decided to revise the titles from the chair and\n       vice-chair of the expert panels to co-chairs and adopted the revision of “Procedure: Terms of reference of the Article 6.4 mechanism expert\n       panels” and “Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of the expert panels under the Supervisory Body”. Further, at\n       SBM 016, the Supervisory Body adopted the revised “Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert\n       panels”, “Terms of reference: Article 6.4 expert panels” and “Terms of Reference: Article 6.4 experts.”\n39.    The secretariat developed and published on the UNFCCC website a total of 42 forms related to:\n       (a)     Governance: Appeal and Grievance forms operationalizing the appeals and grievance process as per the procedure “Appeal and\n               grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”; approval, authorization and withdrawal forms associated with the host Party\n\n\n\n                                                                         17 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n               participation requirements for the Article 6.4 mechanism, as envisaged in the procedure “Article 6.4 Activity cycle procedure for\n               projects”; and the procedure “Article 6.4 procedure for programmes of activities;”\n       (b)     Activity cycle: All forms required for Article 6.4 projects, as envisaged in the procedure “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for\n               programmes of activities;”\n       (c)     CDM activity transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism: Revised approval form for CDM activity transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism;\n               addendum to design document for CDM activity transition request; and declaration on avoidance of double issuance for provisional\n               requests for issuance for Article 6.4 transition projects and PoAs, as envisaged in the procedure “Transition of CDM activities to the\n               Article 6.4 mechanism;”\n       (d)     Methodologies and methodological tools: “Global stakeholder consultation form for proposed new baseline and monitoring\n               methodology or methodological tool,” as envisaged in the procedure “Development, revision, and clarification of methodologies and\n               methodological tools.”\n\n2.1.8.

Work on streamlined capacity-building was undertaken in support of enhancing the substantive and operational knowledge of Parties and\n           stakeholders about Article 6.4-related areas. Article 6.4 training products that cater to specialized and broader audiences were under\n           development, with their launch expected in December 2025.\n51.        In the reporting period, three subregional workshops on Article 6 and Carbon Pricing were delivered in South Asia, Middle East and North\n           Africa, and Western and South Africa. An Article 6 implementation laboratory was conducted as part of the implementation forum during the\n           first Climate Week in Panama. During sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 62), an Article 6 side event and Article 6 capacity-building\n           session were organized for Parties and diverse stakeholders. Other capacity-building activities,7 including webinars, country support,\n           workshops and training sessions, were organized across different regions.\n52.        Targeted capacity-building support, including through RCCs, in the form of webinars, in-country support, and event presentations, was\n           focused on various aspects of Article 6.4 operationalization and engagement, roles and responsibilities of host Parties and DNAs, framework\n           and strategy development, and project/programme development under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Article 6 Capacity Building Team,\n           together with the other substantive teams, developed a user-friendly manual8 for host Parties’ participation in the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n\n7\n     For details of activities, see information note available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2024_inf01.pdf.\n8\n     For more information, see document A6.4-SBM015-AA-A04 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A64-SBM015-AA-A04.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                                                           23 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       The manual was launched in early 2025. Additionally, the Article 6 Capacity Building website, along with other knowledge products, such as\n       explainers related to the Article 6.4 host Party participation requirements form, were launched in the first half of 2025.\n\n53.    Furthermore, to reduce fragmentation of capacity-building efforts and synergize for greater operational efficiency and impact, various\n       partnerships for implementing capacity-building programmes were developed. Strategic collaborations were established with the Institute\n       for Global Environmental Strategies under the “Article 6 Implementation Partnership”, with other global entities such as the Copenhagen\n       Climate Centre, International Renewable Energy Agency, United Nations Environment Programme, World Bank, and regional development\n       banks. Efforts were also undertaken to establish similar partnerships with other stakeholders, including Africa Carbon Markets Initiative and\n       the United Nations University to leverage technical expertise and knowledge in delivering regional workshops on the Article 6.4 mechanism\n       and carbon-pricing planned in 2025, and other capacity-building products developed by the secretariat.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         24 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n2.1.12.

Status of outputs\n54.    During the reporting period, more than 258 inquiries were processed. Issues included both general and substantive inquiries addressed to\n       the secretariat and Supervisory Body. Topics covered transitions of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism, clarifications on rules and\n       regulations adopted by the Supervisory Body, prior notifications consideration, fulfilment of host Party participation requirements, host Party\n       approval, Article 6.4 SD tool, Article 6.4 mechanism registry, mechanism methodologies, authorization, appeal and grievance, validation and\n       verification, transfer of certified emission reductions to the Article 6.4 mechanism, transition fee, finalization of provisional issuance, among\n       others. Additionally, two letters were considered during SBM 015.\n55.    Twenty-three observers, including Parties, were registered to interact with the Supervisory Body during its fifteenth and sixteenth meetings\n       on issues included in the annotated agenda and related annexes of each of its meetings.\n56.    During the reporting period, eight calls for input were launched on various topics. A total of 83 inputs were received from a wide range of\n       stakeholders.\n57.    At SB 010, the Supervisory Body agreed to establish a forum of the Article 6.4 DNAs to support the implementation of the Article 6.4\n       mechanism and to facilitate a dialogue with host Parties. As part of this mandate, the Article 6.4 DNA Forum inaugural meeting was held as\n       part of the first UNFCCC Climate Week 2025 in Panama on 20–22 May 2025. The meeting was attended by more than 130 registered\n       participants, including DNAs, representatives of multilateral development banks and the United Nations, as well as by the Chair and members\n       of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body, providing a space for participants to exchange views and knowledge while identifying best practices and\n       common challenges that DNAs may face in operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Forum adopted its Terms of Reference, which\n       provided the governance framework for its operations, and elected Ms. Cristina Figueroa Vargas of Chile as the co-chair representing\n       developing countries. However, the co-chair seat for developed countries remains vacant until nomination and election are completed by\n       the A6.4 DNA Forum.\n58.    A teleconference was organized by the secretariat on 9 January 2025 to update A6.4 AEs on the outcomes of relevant Supervisory Body\n       meetings.\n59.    As part of the secretariat interactions with stakeholders, the secretariat reached out to all Parties to the Paris Agreement to designate and\n       communicate their national authority for the Article 6.4 mechanism. Accordingly, 107 Parties designated their national authority.\n60.    In addition, the secretariat communicated to all relevant DNAs and UNFCCC national focal points regarding the fulfilment of the requirements\n       related to host Party participation in and host Party approval for eligible CDM activities. Twenty Parties – Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Brazil,\n       Cambodia, Chile, Dominican Republic, Georgia, Ghana, India, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Rwanda, Sri Lanka,\n       Togo and Uganda – communicated their host Party participation requirements to the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n                                                                         26 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n61.    With a view to enhance clarity of stakeholders’ engagement with the Supervisory Body, the procedure “Direct communication with\n       stakeholders” was revised by the Supervisory Body at SBM 016.\n62.    To support host Parties and other participating Parties in navigating the activity cycle processes, the Supervisory Body, at SBM 016, took\n       note of the “Article 6.4 manual for host Parties’ participation in the mechanism” and requested the secretariat to continuously update the\n       manual and ensure consistency between the manual and its webpage format.\n63.    The RCCs continued identifying and assessing key regional actors that support capacity-building, training and knowledge-sharing activities\n       related to Article 6.4. This mapping effort increased understanding of existing initiatives, gaps and opportunities for collaboration, ensuring\n       more effective partnerships. A total of 72 interactions took place, including 23 responses to queries on issues related to the transition from\n       the CDM to the Article 6.4 mechanism and revision of modalities of communication, 10 webinars and 39 in-person workshops.

These outputs reinforce the Supervisory Body's commitment to transparency, openness and accessibility, ensuring that the public has\n       access to essential information.\n69.    At the first meeting of 2025 (SBM 015), the Supervisory Body dedicated its first day to a strategic session, focusing on how to prioritize its\n       work and enhance efficiency in delivering its work programme. The Body agreed to prioritize finalizing the remaining guidance necessary\n       for registering activities and establishing the essential infrastructure to ensure the operation of the mechanism in 2025.\n70.    The secretariat-wide responsibilities included providing substantive inputs on Article 6.4 for requests from the Executive Office and\n       Programme Coordination. Specifically, the Mitigation division responded to requests for inputs to speaking points and briefing notes for\n       senior management during the reporting period.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         31 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism resource allocation plan 2024–2025 implementation (1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n71.

It acknowledged that, while current\n       operations are being managed prudently within available funds, there is still an anticipated shortfall in funds by the end of 2025. In response,\n       the Supervisory Body recognized the efforts to reduce planned 2025 expenditures to 72.8 per cent of the original budget to avoid full depletion\n       of funds and agreed to enhance outreach to raise awareness among Parties and include a recommendation on funding in its annual report\n       to CMA 7.\n75.    During the reporting period, the activities on preparation of the RAP 2026–2027 were initiated with the aim to present it at SBM 017 in August\n       2025.\n76.    During the reporting period, recruitment was completed for 52 of the 63 approved positions, and recruitment for the remaining 11 positions\n       was at various stages of the recruitment process. The secretariat continued to prudently manage and monitor the resource allocation against\n       priority areas of work to ensure the full utilization of available staff in delivering high-quality products on time and in circumstances of budget\n       shortfall.\n77.    During the reporting period, inputs on the Article 6.4 budget were provided for the secretariat’s budget performance report 2024 and work\n       programme for 2026–2027.\n78.    The report for Internal Service Agreement 2024–2025 between the Mitigation division and the Information and Communication Technology\n       (ICT) division was finalized. The report covered the ICT services to support a wide range of activities under the Supervisory Body’s workplan,\n       including ICT services for Supervisory Body meetings, stakeholder interactions, the MIS, and the Article 6.4 mechanism registry in 2024.\n79.    In the reporting period, work began on finalizing the mid-year review report covering the period 1 January – 30 June 2025 on the status of\n       implementation of the RAP 2024–2025.\n80.    To build support for operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism, the secretariat organized and participated in Article 6.4-related events during\n       SB 62 in June in Bonn, Germany, as well as other forums. These events attracted a wide range of stakeholders, including governments,\n       intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and technical experts.\n81.    Actual subscriptions included artificial intelligence tools, graphic and interactive course design tools for Article 6.4 capacity-building activities,\n       as well as online portals offering recent intelligence on carbon-pricing and climate change policies and other interactive software to support\n       activities for operationalization of Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          34 of 37\nA6.4-INFO-GOV-025\nStatus of Article 6.4 mechanism                      resource     allocation    plan     2024–2025       implementation\n(1 January – 30 June 2025)\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n2.2.

Column (d) in table 2 shows the rate of expenditure as a percentage against the 2025\n      budget for each cost category. The total rate of expenditure (43.8 per cent) is below the\n      linear rate of expenditure (50 percent) for the reporting period.\n84.   Staff costs amount to 31.1 per cent of the 2025 budget for this object of expenditure, which\n      is significantly lower than the linear rate of 50 per cent. The lower rate is due to prudent\n      resource management, including capitalizing on the synergies with human resources\n      supporting other areas of work.\n85.   Consultant costs amount to 68.3 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of\n      expenditure, which is higher than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The\n      higher expenditure rate is due to obligations for which the services are yet to be received.\n86.   The expert fees amount to 17.3 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of\n      expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per\n      cent). The expenditure includes the fees for the two meetings of the MEP processed in\n      the period.\n87.   Expert travel amounts to 52.7 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object of\n      expenditure, which is slightly higher than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent).\n      This represents travel costs of the in-person meetings of the panels and working groups\n      in 2025.\n88.   With regard to travel of representatives, there were no charges during the reporting period.\n89.   Travel of Supervisory Body members amounts to 35.1 per cent of the projected 2025\n      budget for this object of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of\n      expenditure (50 per cent). This represents the cost of the in-person meetings of the\n      regulatory body.\n90.   Travel of staff amounts to 38.4 per cent of the 2025 budget for this object of expenditure,\n      which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The lower\n      expenditure reflects reduced staff participation in events outside of Bonn, due to prudent\n      resource management.\n91.   Training costs amount to 10.9 per cent against the projected 2025 budget, which is\n      significantly lower than the linearly projected rate of expenditure (50 per cent). The lower\n      rate is due to prudent resource management.\n92.   Operating expenses amount to 31.2 per cent of the projected 2025 budget for this object\n      of expenditure, which is significantly lower than the projected rate of expenditure (50 per\n      cent). The lower rate is due to prudent resource management.\n93.   Engagement agreement (IT) costs amount to 76.6 per cent of the 2025 budget for this\n      object of expenditure, which is significantly higher than the projected rate of expenditure\n      (50 per cent). The prudent management of resources enabled the secretariat to absorb\n      additional funding needs for continued critical IT development.\n\n3.    Conclusions\n94.

These documents identified a number of areas for further work by the Supervisory Body\n         to complement the guidance in the documents.\n\n3.       At its fifth session, the CMA was not able to complete its consideration on matters relating\n         to Article 6, paragraph 4. CMA 5 requested the Supervisory Body to continue the relevant\n         work to operationalize the mechanism with a view to elaborating and further developing\n         recommendations for consideration and adoption by CMA 6.\n\n4.       Also, in the context of developing and approving new methodologies for the Article 6.4\n         mechanism, the CMA,1 at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body to review the\n         baseline and monitoring methodologies in use for the CDM with a view to applying them\n         with revisions, as appropriate, pursuant to chapter V.B of the RMPs for the activities under\n         the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n2.

For the avoidance of doubt, the payment gateway operator, or a financial intermediary\n            (such as a bank), as the case may be, is a third party and accordingly, We do not\n            accept any liability for any actions or omissions by them.\n\n    7.4.    You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the UNFCCC secretariat from and\n            against all suits, proceedings, claims, demands, losses and liability of any kind or\n            nature brought by any third party against the UNFCCC secretariat, including, but not\n            limited to, all litigation costs and expenses, attorney fees, settlement payments and\n            damages, based on, arising from, or relating to, your breach of these Terms and\n            conditions or any Rules or regulations, your improper use of the Registry, or your\n            breach of any law, or the rights of a third party.\n\n    7.5.    In addition to the indemnity obligations set forth in this section, you shall be obligated,\n            at your sole expense, to defend Us pursuant to this section, regardless of whether the\n            suits, proceedings, claims and demands in question actually give rise to or otherwise\n            result in any loss or liability. We shall advise you about any such suits, proceedings,\n            claims, demands, losses or liability within a reasonable period of time after having\n            received actual notice thereof. You shall have the sole control of defence of any such\n            suit, proceedings, claim or demand and of all negotiations in connection with the\n            settlement or compromise thereof, except with respect to the assertion or defence of\n            the privileges and immunities of the secretariat or any matter relating thereto, for\n            which only the UNFCCC secretariat itself is authorized to assert or maintain. We shall\n            have the right, at our own expense, to be represented in any such suit, proceeding,\n            claim or demand by independent counsel of our own choosing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 11\nA6.4-INFO-REGS-001\nInformation note: Terms and conditions for entity account holders\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n    7.6.    You agree that any disputes, claims, or other issues that may arise between you and\n            other account holders or third parties (including, but not limited to, any issues or\n            disputes relating to the validity of project information, transactions in the Registry,\n            ownership of, security over, or proprietary interests in Article 6.4 Emissions\n            Reductions held in the Registry) will be addressed and resolved between you and\n            such account holders or you and third parties, and without our involvement, or the\n            involvement of the United Nations or its subsidiary bodies, except as may be\n            otherwise provided for in these Terms and conditions.\n\n    7.7.    You will use your best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, claim or other issue\n            arising out of or in connection with your use of the Registry, or these Terms and\n            conditions, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof.\n\n    7.8.    If you are unable to resolve any dispute arising in relation to the Registry or these\n            Terms and conditions amicably, then you must seek an amicable settlement through\n            conciliation in accordance with the Conciliation Rules then prevailing of UNCITRAL.\n\n    7.9.    If a dispute remains unresolved sixty (60) days after one party receives a written\n            request from the other party for such amicable settlement, either party may refer the\n            dispute to an arbitral tribunal composed of three members in accordance with the\n            UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules then prevailing. The place of arbitration shall be Geneva,\n            Switzerland.\n\n    7.10. Each party to the dispute shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators thus\n          appointed shall together appoint a third arbitrator as their Chairperson. If one of the\n          parties fails to appoint its arbitrator and has not proceeded to do so within two (2)\n          months after an invitation from the other party to make such an appointment, the other\n          Party may request the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The\n          Hague to make the necessary appointment. If the two arbitrators are unable to reach\n          agreement, in the two months following their appointment, on the choice of the third\n          arbitrator, either party may invite the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of\n          Arbitration at The Hague to make the necessary appointment.\n\n    7.11. The arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award punitive damages. In addition,\n          the arbitral tribunal shall have no authority to award interest in excess of the London\n          Inter-Bank Offered Rate then prevailing, and any interest shall be simple interest only.\n          The parties shall be bound by any arbitration award rendered as a result of such\n          arbitration as the final adjudication of any such dispute, controversy, or claim. We may\n          accept instructions for actions in the Registry from an account holder pursuant to the\n          outcome of the arbitration, with valid and verified evidence of the arbitration outcome.\n\n    7.12. Notwithstanding items 7.7 through 7.11 herein, if a valid and enforceable agreement\n          exists between the disputing parties that contains a dispute resolution mechanism,\n          such mechanism shall take precedence and shall be the exclusive means for\n          resolving disputes between those parties, in lieu of the dispute resolution procedure\n          set forth in these Terms and conditions; provided, however, that such mechanism\n          shall not conflict with, override, or purport to waive any of the provisions contained in\n          items 7.1 through 7.5 and 7.12 of these Terms and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9 of 11\nA6.4-INFO-REGS-001\nInformation note: Terms and conditions for entity account holders\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n     7.13. Nothing in or relating to these Terms and conditions shall be deemed a waiver,\n           express or implied, of any of the privileges and immunities of the UNFCCC secretariat\n           or the United Nations, including its subsidiary organs.\n\n8.      Security\n     8.1.   You should be aware that the Internet, being an ‘open network’, is not completely\n            secure. If you choose to send or receive any electronic communications to or from us\n            by means of the Registry, or if you submit any content or information for publication\n            on the Registry, you do so at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such\n            communications will not be intercepted or changed, or that they will reach the intended\n            recipient without interruption or at all. We will use reasonable endeavours to ensure\n            the Registry is reasonably secure, however, We cannot guarantee that any\n            information displayed on the Registry has not been changed or modified through\n            malicious attacks or any other unauthorized third-party intervention.\n\n     8.2.   It is your responsibility to ensure that your login details remain secure and confidential.\n            You must inform Us as soon as possible if you know or suspect that your login details\n            are known by or available to any third party. If you inform us of any suspected or\n            actual loss or disclosure of your login details, We will suspend your account in\n            accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry”.\n\n     8.3.   You are liable for any use of your login details on the Registry, including any actions\n            taken using your login details.\n\n     8.4.   You are responsible for keeping your login details and contact details up to date in\n            the Registry.\n\n9.      General\n     9.1.   You must not assign or transfer or purport to assign or transfer any of your rights or\n            obligations under these Terms and conditions without our prior written consent.\n\n     9.2.   These Terms and conditions are additional to all other rights, remedies and powers\n            provided in the Rules and regulations, and are additional to the Terms of Use of the\n            UNFCCC as provided at https://unfccc.int/this-site/terms-of-use.\n\n     9.3.   The failure by either you or Us to exercise any of our respective rights, whether under\n            these Terms and conditions or otherwise, is not deemed for any purpose to constitute\n            a waiver by the other party of any such right or remedy associated therewith, and\n            does not relieve the parties of any of their obligations under these Terms and\n            conditions.\n\n     9.4.   All notices and other communications in relation to these Terms and conditions must\n            be sent to Us in writing in English via email at a6.4mechanism-Registry@unfccc.int.\n            Any communication will be deemed duly given if sent during normal business hours\n            of the UNFCCC secretariat during a business day, and otherwise, on the next\n            business day, if sent after outside our normal business hours.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 11\nA6.4-INFO-REGS-001\nInformation note: Terms and conditions for entity account holders\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n     9.5.

The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism). 1 Chapter XI.A of the RMPs contains provisions that allow\n          transition of project activities and programmes of activities (PoAs) registered under the\n          clean development mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol or listed as\n          provisional as per the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Board of the CDM 2\n          (hereinafter referred to as provisional requests) to the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated key conditions and processes for such\n          transition. 3 At the same session, the CMA also requested 4 the Supervisory Body to\n          facilitate the tasks related to the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\n          by:\n          (a)      Developing and operationalizing a procedure for requesting transition, which\n                   includes relevant forms, by no later than June 2023;\n          (b)      Developing and operationalizing the transition process and reporting back to the\n                   CMA at its fifth session.\n3.        The CMA, at its sixth session 5 , decided that afforestation and reforestation project\n          activities and PoAs registered under the CDM may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism,\n          and be registered as Article 6.4 activities. The CMA also elaborated key conditions for\n          such a transition.\n4.        Pursuant to its mandate from the CMA to operationalize the transition process, the\n          Supervisory Body has adopted the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article\n          6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the transition standard) and the “Procedure:\n          Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as this\n          procedure) and relevant forms as contained in this document.\n5.        The Supervisory Body at its 16th meeting agreed to provisions on avoidance of double\n          issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities. The Supervisory\n          Body further decided to require the use of re-evaluated values for the fraction of non-\n          renewable biomass (fNRB) and the discount factor for the leakage for activities using CDM\n          methodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission reductions.\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Process for transition\n5.1.      Submission of transition request\n9.        The project participant of a CDM project activity or PoA other than a CDM A/R project\n          activity or CDM A/R PoA and CPAs therein, that is eligible for transition to the Article 6.4\n          mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard shall, if it\n          wishes for such transition, submit a request for transition to indicate the wish of transition\n\n\n6    In accordance with paragraph 42 of the “CDM project cycle procedure for project activities” (version 03.0)\n     and paragraph 33 of the “CDM project cycle procedure for programmes of activities” (version 03.0), the\n     focal point entities designated by the project participants for scope (c) are granted the authority to\n     communicate on their behalf with the Board and the secretariat on all other project-related matters not\n     covered by: (a) communication in relation to requests for forwarding of certified emission reductions to\n     individual accounts of the project participants; or (b) communication in relation to requests for addition\n     and/or voluntary withdrawal of the project participants and focal points, as well as changes to company\n     names, legal status, contact details and specimen signatures.\n\n\n\n                                                     4 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n         to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the\n         information in the form contained in appendix 1,7 by 31 December 2023, 24:00 (Central\n         European Time).\n10.      The project participant of a CDM A/R project activity or CDM A/R PoA and the CPAs\n         therein, that is eligible for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the\n         relevant provisions of the transition standard shall, if it wishes to transition, submit a\n         request to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website. The\n         project participant shall provide the information in the form contained in Appendix 1 by 31\n         December 2025, at 24:00 hours (Central European Time).\n11.      In requesting the transition of a CDM PoA that had included CPAs under the CDM, the\n         project participant shall specify which of the included CPAs that are eligible for transition\n         to the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition\n         standard it wishes to transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism. CPAs included in a PoA\n         under the CDM may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in conjunction with, or\n         subsequent to, the transition of the PoA to the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n12.      The secretariat shall check the completeness of the information provided in the submitted\n         request for transition and, if found complete, publish the request on the UNFCCC website\n         providing the web link to the project information page of the CDM project activity or CDM\n         PoA on the UNFCCC CDM website, and assigning a unique reference number(s) that\n         enable(s) the identification of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein,\n         transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, distinguishing them from new activities\n         registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall\n         promptly notify the reason for the incompleteness to the project participant. The project\n         participant shall submit a corrected request for transition within 14 days of the notification;\n         otherwise the secretariat shall reject the request.\n13.      After publishing the request for transition on the UNFCCC website, the secretariat shall\n         promptly inform the DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism and the DNA for the CDM of the\n         host Party of the CDM project activity or PoA of the receipt of the request. If the host Party\n         has not yet established the DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism, the secretariat shall inform\n         its national focal point to the UNFCCC (hereinafter collectively referred to as the DNA for\n         the Article 6.4 mechanism) of the request.8 With this, the request for transition shall be\n         deemed as having been submitted by the project participants to both the secretariat and\n         the host Party in accordance with paragraph 73(a) of the RMPs.\n\n5.2.     Global stakeholder consultation\n14.      Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC admitted observer organizations may submit\n         comments, in English, on the transition of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs\n         therein, to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website within 28\n         days of the publication of the request for transition on the UNFCCC website. The\n         submitters of the comments shall provide the names and contact details of the individuals\n\n\n\n\n7   The secretariat may convert the form into an electronic interface.\n8   The contacts of national focal points of Parties to the UNFCCC are listed at:\n    https://unfccc.int/process/parties-non-party-stakeholders/parties/national-focal-point.\n\n\n\n                                                    5 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n         or organizations on whose behalf the comments are submitted. Comments from\n         stakeholders shall:\n         (a)     Be specific to the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, being requested\n                 for transition;\n         (b)     Be related to the compliance with applicable rules and regulations for transition.\n15.      The secretariat shall make the comments that meet the requirements in paragraph 14\n         above publicly available on the UNFCCC website where the transition request is displayed\n         and inform the Supervisory Body and the DNAs of the host Party and other Parties\n         involved that the comments have been made public.\n16.      For a CDM PoA being requested for transition, after the global stakeholder consultation\n         but before the approval by the host Party of the transition in accordance with section 5.3\n         below, the project participants may:\n         (a)     Add eligible CPAs not specified in the initial transition request referred to in\n                 paragraph 11 above; and/or\n         (b)     Remove from the transition request any CPAs specified in the initial transition\n                 request.\n17.      For the cases referred to in paragraph 16 above, the project participants shall submit a\n         revised transition request to the secretariat through the dedicated interface on the\n         UNFCCC website referred to in paragraphs 9 above or 10 above, reflecting the addition\n         and/or removal of CPAs that they wish to transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in\n         conjunction with, or subsequent to, the transition of the PoA. The secretariat shall check\n         the completeness of the revised transition request and, if it is found to be complete, shall\n         publish it on the UNFCCC website, replacing the initial transition request, and promptly\n         inform the DNAs for the Article 6.4 mechanism and the DNAs for the CDM of the host\n         Parties of the receipt of the revised transition request. The revised transition request is not\n         required to undergo a new global stakeholder consultation.\n\n5.3.     Submission of host Party approval\n18.      The host Party of the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, regarding which a\n         request for transition has been published on the UNFCCC website shall, if it approves\n         such transition, submit an approval of transition from its DNA for the Article 6.4 mechanism\n         to the Supervisory Body through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing\n         the information in the form contained in appendix 2,9 by 31 December 2025, 24:00 (Central\n         European Time).\n19.      The least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS) may\n         include information, either when submitting their participation requirements to the Article\n         6.4 mechanism or at the approval stage of an activity, on whether they choose not to\n         exempt the CDM project activity or PoA and CPAs therein, hosted in their territories and\n         requesting transition, from the share of proceeds for adaptation.\n20.      Notwithstanding paragraph 19 above, if an LDC or SIDS host Party has already submitted\n         its participation requirements or provided approval for a CDM project activity or PoA and\n\n\n9   The secretariat may convert the form into an electronic interface.\n\n\n\n                                                   6 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n       CPAs therein hosted in their territories and requesting transition, by the time of entry of\n       force of version 4 of this procedure, the LDCs and SIDS, may provide information on\n       whether they choose not to exempt the CDM project activity or PoA and CPAs therein\n       from the share of proceeds for adaptation by resubmitting the participation requirements\n       and/or the approval form at the latest by 31 December 2025 or at first issuance, whichever\n       is earlier. If no such information is received by the deadline, the exemption from the share\n       of proceeds for adaptation shall be effected.\n21.    A multi-country PoA may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism provided that at least one\n       host Party has provided approval within the deadline referred to in paragraph 18 above. If\n       there is more than one host Party for a CDM PoA10 being requested for transition, only the\n       CPAs in the host Parties that have submitted an approval of transition by the deadline may\n       transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the transition\n       of the PoA.\n22.    The project participant or DOE (hereinafter collectively referred to as the proponent) may\n       proceed with the submission of the additional documentation referred to in section 5.4\n       below after at least one host Party has submitted an approval of transition. If the proponent\n       wishes to transition any of the CPAs specified in the transition request subsequent to the\n       transition of the CDM PoA, the proponent shall prepare the additional documentation\n       referred to in section 5.4 below for each such transition request of CPAs.\n23.    The host Party may submit an approval of transition only after it has fulfilled the\n       requirements for participating in the Article 6.4 mechanism referred to in paragraph 26 of\n       the RMPs by demonstrating the fulfilment in accordance with the relevant provisions in the\n       “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” or the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure\n       for programmes of activities”, as applicable.\n24.    If the host Party approves the transition, it shall provide a statement of authorization on\n       the use of A6.4ERs to be issued for the project or PoA and CPAs therein as early as\n       possible but prior to the first issuance of A6.4ERs for the project, PoA and CPAs therein.11\n       The host Party shall provide such a statement by completing a form, through a dedicated\n       interface on the UNFCCC website.\n25.    If the host Party has indicated that it allows mitigation contribution A6.4ERs to be issued\n       for the project or PoA and CPAs therein, while noting that it may authorize the A6.4ERs\n       at a later stage, the respective rules and requirements shall be applied as per the\n       respective provisions of the procedures “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedures\n       for projects” and “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of\n       activities”.\n26.    The secretariat shall publish the host Party approval of transition on the UNFCCC website\n       and promptly inform the project participant of the receipt of such approval.\n\n\n\n\n10 Under the CDM, a PoA may be designed beyond the border of a country and thus could have more than\n\n  one host Party, while a project activity shall be designed within the border of a country and thus will\n  always have only one host Party.\n11 As per decision -/CMA.6 (Advance unedited version).

Submission of additional documentation\n27.     If the project participant continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology to the\n        transitioning CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, in accordance with the\n        relevant provisions in the transition standard, it shall, within 180 days for emission\n        reduction projects and PoAs of the publication of the host Party approval of transition in\n        accordance with paragraph 26 above and before 31 December 2025 for CDM A/R projects\n        and PoAs, submit to the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n        website, an addendum to the respective project design document (PDD), or PoA design\n        document (PoA-DD) and CPA design documents (CPA-DDs), using the form contained in\n        appendix 312 to attest that the CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, have been\n        implemented in accordance with the registered PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, as well\n        as to demonstrate the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the\n        Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition\n        standard. With the attestation in the addendum, the relevant PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-\n        DDs, shall be deemed submitted by the project participant.\n28.     Notwithstanding paragraph 27 above, for CDM A/R project activities or CDM A/R PoAs\n        and the CPAs therein that have successfully transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the\n        PPs shall request a designated operational entity (DOE) accredited in the relevant sectoral\n        scope under the Article 6.4 mechanism to validate and assess compliance of the additional\n        documentation with the respective applicable requirements for activities involving\n        removals under the mechanism contained in the standard “Requirements for activities\n        involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism” and other applicable methodological\n        regulatory document approved by the Supervisory Body. This validation shall occur in\n        conjunction with verification for first issuance.\n29.     If the project participant voluntarily replaces, or is required to replace, the CDM\n        methodology currently applied to the transitioning CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs\n        therein, with an Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter referred to as mechanism\n        methodology) in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard, it shall\n        revise the PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, accordingly, using the corresponding forms\n        developed for Article 6.4 mechanism activities, and request a designated operational entity\n        (DOE) accredited in the relevant sectoral scope under the Article 6.4 mechanism to\n        validate them to demonstrate appropriate application of the mechanism methodology and\n        the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism in accordance with the relevant provisions in the transition standard. If the\n        validation outcome is positive (i.e. the mechanism methodology is appropriately applied\n        and the compliance with additional requirements for registration under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism is demonstrated), the DOE shall, within one year of the publication of the host\n        Party approval of transition in accordance with paragraph 26 above or within one year\n        after the applicable mechanism methodology becomes available, whichever is later,\n        submit to the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, the\n        revised PDD, or PoA-DD and CPA-DDs, as well as the validation report.\n\n5.5.    Processing of transition request\n30.     The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the additional documentation referred to in paragraph\n        27 or 29 above, issue a statement of the transition fee due, determined based on the\n        following principles, and shall communicate it to the project participant or the DOE who\n\n12 The secretariat may convert this form into an electronic interface for the submission of the addendum.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n       submitted the additional documentation (hereinafter collectively referred to as the\n       proponent):\n       (a)     Requests for transition of CDM project activities, PoAs and CPAs are subject to\n               the share of proceeds applicable to requests for registration of projects and PoAs\n               and inclusion of component projects (CPs), respectively, under the Article 6.4\n               mechanism;13\n       (b)     All fees for requests for registration, issuance, renewal and post-registration\n               changes to project activities and PoAs as well as inclusion of CPs under the Article\n               6.4 mechanism are waived for activities in least developed countries and small\n               island developing States.14\n31.    The project participant shall pay the transition fee by bank transfer, quoting the unique\n       reference number(s) referred to in paragraph 12 above. The project participant shall\n       submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated interface on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n32.    The paid transition fee may be reimbursed in full or partially if the request for transition is\n       withdrawn by the proponent in accordance with section 7 below or rejected by the\n       Supervisory Body in line with the corresponding provisions on the reimbursement of the\n       registration fee as contained in the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” or the\n       “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”.\n33.    The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the proof of payment of the transition fee if it is due,\n       or upon receipt of the additional documentation if the transition fee is not due, commence\n       the completeness check of the additional documentation for transition requests for CDM\n       project activity, or PoA and CPAs for which the host Party(ies) provided approval as per\n       section 5.3 above. To commence the completeness check, the secretariat shall prioritize\n       requests for transition for small-scale CDM project activities and CDM PoAs.\n34.    The secretariat shall conclude the completeness check within seven days of its\n       commencement. If, during the completeness check, the secretariat identifies issues of an\n       editorial nature or of consistency in the documentation, it shall request the proponent to\n       submit revised documents to correct them. In this case, the proponent shall submit the\n       requested documents within two days of receipt of the request. Upon receipt of the revised\n       documents, the secretariat shall resume15 the completeness check. If the proponent does\n       not submit the requested documents by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that\n       the request submission is incomplete and inform the proponent that the request for\n       transition cannot be processed any further. The proponent may restart the process by\n       submitting the additional documentation again with the revised documents in accordance\n       with section 5.4 above, which is subject to a new transition fee.\n35.    Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall commence the\n       substantive check of the additional documentation to determine whether the transitioning\n       CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, complies with the relevant requirements\n       for transition contained in the transition standard within 21 days of its commencement.\n\n13 In accordance with decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, paragraph 14(a).\n\n14 In accordance with decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, paragraph 58.\n\n15 The same deadlines apply to the resumed completeness check as applicable to the initial completeness\n\n  check.\n\n\n\n                                                 9 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n       Upon conclusion of the substantive check, the secretariat shall publish the additional\n       documentation and indicate the completion of the substantive check on the UNFCCC\n       website and notify the host Party and the Supervisory Body of the completion of the\n       substantive check to initiate the review process in accordance with section 5.6 below. If,\n       during the substantive check, the secretariat identifies substantive issues that may be\n       resolved by revising the additional documentation, it shall request the proponent to submit\n       revised documents to resolve them. In this case, the proponent shall submit the requested\n       documents within seven days of receipt of the request. Upon receipt of the revised\n       documents, the secretariat shall resume16 the substantive check. If the proponent does\n       not submit the requested documents by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that\n       the request submission is incomplete.\n36.    The secretariat shall prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the\n       transition request, summarizing its findings in respect of the compliance with the relevant\n       requirements for transition contained in the transition standard and including its\n       recommendation whether to approve the requested transition within 14 days of the date\n       of publication of the additional documentation.\n\n5.6.   Requesting review of transition request\n37.    The host Party of the transitioning CDM project activity or PoA, or any member or alternate\n       member of the Supervisory Body, may request a review of the request for transition within\n       28 days of receipt of the notification of the completion of the substantive check in\n       accordance with paragraph 35 above, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n       website, providing reasons for requesting a review.\n38.    If a review of the request for transition is requested by the host Party or any member or\n       alternate member of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall:\n       (a)     Notify the proponent that the request is under review;\n       (b)     Indicate such status on the UNFCCC website, and request the project participant\n               and/or the DOE to:\n               (i)    Provide responses to the issues identified in the request for review no later\n                      than seven days from the date of notification that the request has been\n                      placed under review;\n               (ii)   For each issue (or sub-issue) raised in the request for review, the project\n                      participant and/or the DOE (if applicable) shall either:\n                       a.     Respond by making any revisions that they deem necessary to the\n                              relevant documentation, submitting revised documents in track\n                              changes and final versions; or\n                       b.     Respond in writing, explaining why no revisions to the documentation\n                              are necessary.\n\n\n\n\n16 The same deadlines apply to the resumed completeness check as applicable to the initial completeness\n\n  check.\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n39.       The secretariat shall present the case to the Supervisory Body at its next meeting or\n          electronically.\n40.       For cases applying a new Article 6.4 methodology, as set out in paragraph 29 above, the\n          review process shall follow the procedures specified in the “Article 6.4 activity cycle\n          procedure for projects” and the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for PoAs”, as\n          applicable.\n\n5.7.      Finalizing transition request\n41.       If no review of the request for transition is requested by the deadline referred to in\n          paragraph 37 above, the request for transition shall be deemed approved by the\n          Supervisory Body.\n42.       Stakeholders, project participants, the host Party or other participating Parties (hereinafter\n          referred to as “eligible individuals, communities and organizations that have standing for\n          filling an appeal”) may, in accordance with the appeal and grievance procedure,17 file an\n          appeal to the Supervisory Body’s decision to approve the transition18 within 28 days of the\n          request for transition being deemed approved. If no appeal is filed by an eligible\n          stakeholder, project participant or Party within this time frame, the transition shall be\n          deemed final. If an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project participant or Party\n          within this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed.\n43.       If a review of the request for transition is requested, the Supervisory Body shall review the\n          request and take one of the following decisions, taking into account the presentation on\n          the case by the secretariat:\n          (a)    Approve the request;\n          (b)    Conditionally approve the request, provided that the project participants agree to\n                 the modifications to the additional documentation proposed by the Supervisory\n                 Body;\n          (c)    Reject the request.\n44.       For the case referred to in paragraph 43(b) above, if the proponent does not agree with\n          the modification within seven days of the decision, the request shall be deemed rejected\n          by the Supervisory Body.\n45.       The secretariat shall notify the decision of the Supervisory Body to the proponent, the host\n          Party and the DOE (if applicable), and indicate it on the UNFCCC website.\n46.       If the decision of the Supervisory Body is to reject the request for transition, the proponent\n          may not resubmit a request for transition of the same CDM project activity, or PoA and\n          CPAs therein.\n47.       If the decision of the Supervisory Body is to approve the transition of the CDM project\n          activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, the secretariat shall inform the Executive Board of the\n\n\n17   “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism” (A6.4-PROC-GOV-006).\n     See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-006.pdf.\n18 For decision on finalization of the provisional request for issuance the deadline for appeal is 14 days as\n\n     per the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”.\n\n\n\n                                                  11 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n       CDM of the decision. The secretariat shall register the activity under the Article 6.4\n       mechanism, to be effective on the day it is deregistered from the CDM.\n48.    Eligible stakeholders, project participants and Parties may, in accordance with the appeal\n       and grievance procedure, file an appeal against the decision of the Supervisory Body\n       within 28 days of the decision19. If no appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project\n       participant or Party within this time frame, the decision of the Supervisory Body shall be\n       deemed final. If an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, project participant or Party\n       within this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed.\n49.    Irrespective of the effective date of transition, the crediting period of the transitioned project\n       activity and CPAs as well as the PoA period of the transitioned PoA under the Article 6.4\n       mechanism shall start from 1 January 2021.\n50.    Once registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the transitioned project activities, PoAs\n       and CPAs for which the host Party(ies) provided approval as per section 5.3 above shall\n       be subject to all relevant requirements under the Article 6.4 mechanism at all subsequent\n       steps in the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism, taking into account the relevant\n       provisions in the transition standard.\n51.    For a multi-country PoA that has transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism, if the transition\n       is processed without having an approval of transition by all host Parties:\n       (a)     Any remaining host Parties may be added to the PoA and the CPAs hosted in those\n               countries may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism after the transition of the PoA\n               in accordance with paragraph 21 above;\n       (b)     If any remaining host Parties miss the deadline for providing an approval of\n               transition referred to in paragraph 18 above, addition of these host Parties to the\n               PoA is still possible by undergoing the post-registration change process under the\n               Article 6.4 mechanism, but the CPAs hosted by these countries and included in the\n               transition request may no longer transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism;\n       (c)     A new host Party may be added to the transitioned PoA in accordance with the\n               relevant provisions under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n6.     Process for finalizing provisional requests\n52.    Process for finalization of provisional requests shall follow the provisions in section 5\n       above, mutatis mutandis, with the following modifications:\n       (a)     The project participant may submit a request for finalization of a provisional request\n               for issuance under the transition procedure if the underlying CDM project activity\n               or PoA continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition,\n               and only after the Supervisory Body has approved the transition of the underlying\n               CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, to the Article 6.4 mechanism. In\n               this case, the deadline for submission for the transition request referred to in\n               paragraph 9 above is not applicable and additional documentation to be submitted\n               in accordance with paragraph 27 above shall be:\n\n\n\n19 See footnote 18.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12 of 24\nA6.4-PROC-AC-001\nProcedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 05.1\n\n\n\n\n                (i)    A revised monitoring report instead of an addendum to the PDD, or PoA-DD\n                       and CPA-DDs, recalculating the emission reductions by applying:\n                         a.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The CMA, at its sixth session, elaborated provisions of the RMPs relating to the\n          authorization of the use of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs) and\n          exemption from the share of proceeds for adaptation for least developed countries (LDCs)\n          and small island developing States (SIDS).4\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable\n          development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool) that provides means for\n          activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory requirements for\n          identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for assessing and\n          enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to sustainable development in line with\n          sustainable development objectives and priorities of the host Party and the sustainable\n          development goals.\n5.        The Supervisory Body, at its sixteenth meeting, adopted revisions to the “Standard: Article\n          6.4 activity standard for projects” (AS-P) which, among other things, included the relevant\n          requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. Additionally, the AS-P included new provisions allowing\n          activity participants to request a deviation through a DOE to the Supervisory Body prior to\n          submitting a request for registration or request for issuance if the DOE or the activity\n          participants identifies the presence of unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the\n          environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by\n          consultation or mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex.

The secretariat shall publish the information provided by host Parties in accordance with\n        paragraphs 10‒12 above on the UNFCCC website.\n\n4.2.    Prior consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism\n15.     The activity participants of a proposed A6.4 project shall demonstrate that the Article 6.4\n        mechanism benefits were considered necessary in the decision to implement the project\n        by notifying the secretariat of their intention to seek registration of the proposed A6.4\n        project under the Article 6.4 mechanism (hereinafter referred to as prior consideration\n        notification) through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website. If the project has\n        already started as per the definition of the “start date” of a project in the “Article 6.4 activity\n        standard for projects” (hereinafter referred to as the activity standard), the activity\n        participants shall submit such notification no later than 180 days after the start date of the\n        project. The prior consideration notification shall accompany a summary of the project\n        information, which shall include, at minimum:\n        (a)     The project title;\n        (b)     The names of the activity participants;\n        (c)     The precise geographical location;\n        (d)     A brief description of the technologies or measures to be deployed;\n        (e)     The Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter referred to as mechanism\n                methodology) to be applied (if known);\n        (f)     The actual or planned start date of the activity;\n        (g)     The type (fixed or renewable), planned start date and duration of the crediting\n                period;\n        (h)     The approximate amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                expected to be achieved by the project annually during the crediting period.\n16.     If the start date of a proposed A6.4 project is after 31 December 2020 and prior to the date\n        of entry into force of version 01.0 of this procedure, if they wish to seek registration of the\n        project under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the activity participants shall, provide a prior\n        consideration notification through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website\n        referred to in paragraph 15 above within 180 days after the entry into force of version 01.0\n        of this procedure.\n17.     Once the secretariat confirms that the required information has been duly provided, it shall\n        promptly assign a unique project reference number and publish the prior consideration\n        notification on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n18.     Upon publication of the prior consideration notification on the UNFCCC website, the\n        secretariat shall inform the host Party of the proposed A6.4 project of the receipt of such\n        notification. The host Party may then indicate through, the dedicated interface on the\n        UNFCCC website that it has no objection to the proposed A6.4 project proceeding with\n        the registration request under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n4.3.    Global stakeholder consultation\n19.     The activity participants shall submit a project design document (PDD) prepared in\n        accordance with the activity standard to the secretariat, using the “Project design\n        document form” within one year of the publication of the prior consideration notification or\n        within one year after the applicable mechanism methodology becomes available,\n        whichever occurs later. The secretariat shall promptly publish the PDD as submitted on\n        the UNFCCC website.\n20.     Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations may submit\n        comments in English on the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website within 28 days of the publication of the PDD on the\n        UNFCCC website. The submitters of the comments shall provide the name and contact\n        details of the individual or organization on whose behalf the comments are submitted.\n        Comments from stakeholders shall:\n        (a)     Be specific to the proposed A6.4 project;\n        (b)     Relate to compliance with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and regulations.\n21.     The secretariat shall make the comments that meet the requirements in paragraph 20\n        above publicly available on the UNFCCC website where the PDD is displayed, and inform\n        the activity participants and the DNA of the host Party of the publication.\n\n4.4.    Host Party approval and authorization of activity participants\n22.     The secretariat shall, upon publication of the PDD on the UNFCCC website, inform the\n        host Party of the receipt of the PDD, and request the host Party, based on the project\n        information contained in the PDD, the implications of hosting the project on the\n        implementation of its NDC, and, if the host Party wishes to do so, taking into account the\n        comments submitted during the global stakeholder consultation and published on the\n        UNFCCC website in accordance with section 4.3 above, to respond to the publication,\n        through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website any time after it has fulfilled the\n        requirements for participating in the Article 6.4 mechanism referred to in paragraph 10\n        above by:\n        (a)     Approving the project to be registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism, noting that\n                the registration of the project is subject to a positive validation outcome by a DOE\n                and approval by the Supervisory Body; or\n        (b)     Rejecting the project to be registered under the Article 6.4 mechanism, providing\n                the reason for rejection.\n23.     The host Party, through its DNA, should respond to the publication promptly and is\n        encouraged to do so within 60 days of the notification or in any longer timeframe to be\n        indicated by the host Party through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website.\n        Before responding, the host Party, through its DNA, may request the activity participants\n\n\n\n                                                  10 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n         to provide additional information on the proposed A6.4 project to support its consideration\n         on whether to approve the project, authorize the activity participants or authorize the use\n         of A6.4ERs towards achievement of NDCs or other international mitigation purposes\n         referred to in decision 2/CMA.3.\n24.

If the changes are determined by the DOE to be significant, the\n        DOE shall request the activity participants to make a revised PDD publicly available for\n        global stakeholder consultation. The DOE or the activity participant may seek guidance\n        from the Supervisory Body on whether a revised PDD shall be published for global\n        stakeholder consultation by submitting such a request in accordance with the “Procedure:\n        Direct communication with stakeholders”.\n29.     The Supervisory Body shall expeditiously consider the case, through electronic means\n        where possible, and provide guidance to the DOE and/or the activity participants. In doing\n        so, the Supervisory Body shall consider the significance of the changes in terms of the\n        impact on the application of the applied methodologies, the other methodological\n        regulatory documents and local stakeholders.\n30.     If the activity participants wish to deviate from the selected mechanism methodology when\n        applying it to the proposed A6.4 project, they shall, prior to the preparation of the PDD,\n        submit a request for clarification to the secretariat on whether such deviation is acceptable\n        in accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of baseline\n        and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”.\n31.     If unavoidable negative impacts are identified by activity participants that exceed the\n        environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by\n        consultation or mitigation, activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE\n        as per the process for requesting a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD\n        Tool described in section 4.6.4 below.\n\n4.6.2. Modalities of communication statement\n32.     The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 project shall designate one or more focal\n        point entities (hereinafter referred to as focal points) to communicate on their behalf with\n        the Supervisory Body and the secretariat within the defined scopes of authority referred to\n        in paragraph 34 below, and include this information in a modalities of communication\n        (MoC) statement using the “Modalities of communication statement form”.\n33.

The activity participants shall grant the focal points the authority to:\n        (a)     Communicate in relation to requests for forwarding of A6.4ERs to individual\n                accounts of the activity participants (scope (a)); and/or\n        (b)     Communicate in relation to changes to the MoC statement (scope (b)); and/or\n        (c)     Communicate on all other project-related matters not covered by (a) or (b) above\n                (scope (c)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n35.     The activity participants may designate one or multiple entities for each scope of authority\n        in a sole, shared or joint focal point role.10\n36.     The activity participants and the focal points may designate one primary authorized\n        signatory and one alternate authorized signatory. The authentication of either the primary\n        or alternate authorized signatory shall suffice for authenticating the activity participant’s or\n        the focal point’s consent or instruction(s). If an entity serves as both an activity participant\n        and a focal point, the same signatory shall represent the entity in both roles.\n37.     The activity participants may voluntarily indicate in the MoC statement the end date of their\n        participation in the proposed A6.4 project. The secretariat shall monitor the end date of\n        participation and mark the activity participants as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website on\n        the day after the end date, provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the\n        host Party of the project remains. The activity participants whose participation in the\n        project has ended may request to be re-included as an activity participant in the same\n        project at any time thereafter in accordance with paragraph 152(a) below.\n38.     The secretariat shall, when conducting the completeness check of the request for\n        registration in accordance with paragraphs 75−77 below, consider the contact details\n        included in the MoC statement to be the valid contact details of the activity participants\n        whenever such details differ from the details of the activity participants and their\n        representatives included in the PDD of the proposed A6.4 project.\n39.     The secretariat shall publish non-confidential information included in the MoC statement\n        on the respective A6.4 project webpage of the UNFCCC website, following the registration\n        of the project under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n4.6.3. Validation of project design document\n40.     The activity participants shall submit the PDD published for the global stakeholder\n        consultation or any later version of the PDD, along with the MoC statement, a declaration\n        that the development, implementation and operation of the proposed A6.4 project do not\n        involve any illegal activities and any supporting documentation to a DOE accredited in the\n        relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participants to perform validation\n        of the project for registration.\n41.     The DOE shall perform validation of whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with the\n        relevant requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4\n        mechanism rules and requirements based on the information provided in the PDD, the\n        MoC statement, any supporting documentation it has received from the activity\n        participants and any further information obtained during the validation activity. The DOE\n        shall prepare a validation report in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and\n        verification standard for projects” (hereinafter referred to as the validation and verification\n        standard), using the “Validation report form for projects”.\n42.     For the purpose of potential selection of the validation activity for performance assessment\n        of the DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”, the DOE shall\n        notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the\n\n\n10 Joint focal point role requires consent from all focal point entities to communicate with the Supervisory\n\n  Body or the secretariat. Shared focal point role allows any focal point entity to communicate with the\n  Supervisory Body or the secretariat without requiring consent from other focal point entities.\n\n\n\n                                                  13 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        scheduled site inspection for the proposed A6.4 project which is to be conducted in\n        accordance with the validation and verification standard, no later than four weeks prior to\n        the inspection.\n\n4.6.4. Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool\n\n4.6.4.1.        Submission of a request for deviation\n43.     The DOE may submit a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool to the\n        secretariat and seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a\n        deviation. Such deviation may be submitted when the activity participants prior to\n        validation or the DOE during validation have identified the presence of unavoidable\n        impacts that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria, and\n        that cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation.\n44.     To seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of the deviation, the\n        DOE shall submit a “Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool request\n        form” and additional documentation through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n        website. In the submission, the DOE shall provide:\n        (a)     A clear and precise assessment of the case, based on evidence provided by the\n                activity participant as per the activity standard, including input from local\n                stakeholders if any;\n        (b)     A description of the impact of the deviation on social, environmental and\n                sustainable development impacts from the proposed project;\n        (c)     A draft PDD with a completed section A: Project description and Section D:\n                Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts\n                including its Appendixes 6 (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                assessment form), 7 (A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form)\n                and/or 8 (A6.4 Sustainable development impact form).\n\n4.6.4.2.        Processing of request for deviation\n45.     The secretariat shall issue a statement of the deviation consideration fee due, or\n        confirmation that no fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions on the fee\n        contained in Appendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE.\n46.     The DOE shall communicate to the activity participants the deviation consideration fee\n        due, or a confirmation that no fee is due.\n47.     The activity participants shall pay the deviation consideration fee by bank transfer, quoting\n        the unique project reference number referred to in paragraph 17 above, within 30 days of\n        the issuance to the DOE of the statement of the deviation consideration fee due.\n48.     The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website.\n49.     If the secretariat does not receive the deviation consideration fee by the 30-day deadline\n        referred to in paragraph 47 above, the request for deviation shall be deemed withdrawn.\n        The DOE may submit a new request for deviation of the same proposed A6.4 project\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        anytime thereafter, following the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements\n        valid at the time of the new submission.\n50.     The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted requests for deviation\n        on the UNFCCC website for which the applicable fee has been received by the secretariat\n        or for which no fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly available the schedule of\n        processing the requests for deviation, including the expected date of commencement. The\n        secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of the requests for\n        deviation in accordance with the secretariat’s operational plans – that is, monthly quotas\n        – which shall also incorporate any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body.\n51.     The secretariat shall commence the processing of the request for deviation in accordance\n        with the schedule. The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check within seven days\n        to determine whether the request submission is complete in accordance with\n        paragraph 44 above.\n52.     If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        inconsistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE, by e-mail, to submit revised\n        documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the requested\n        documents and/or information within two days of receipt of the request. If the DOE does\n        not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat\n        shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless the DOE provides a\n        justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested documents and/or\n        information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly.\n53.     The secretariat shall notify the DOE of the conclusion of the completeness check. If the\n        request submission is found incomplete, the secretariat shall also communicate the\n        underlying reasons to the DOE and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n        In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for deviation with revised documentation.\n        If the resubmission of the request for deviation is made within 28 days of the notification,\n        the secretariat shall promptly commence the completeness check again; otherwise the\n        resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for deviation.\n54.     Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall publish the\n        request for deviation on the UNFCCC website, and the request for deviation shall be\n        deemed received by the Supervisory Body for consideration.\n55.     Within 14 days of the date of publication of the request for deviation, the secretariat shall\n        prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for deviation\n        including a recommendation on the course of action, or with a notification that the case\n        will be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting.\n56.     If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require\n        clarifications from the DOE, it shall request the DOE to submit revised documents and/or\n        information to clarify the issues within 14 days of receipt of the request. If the DOE submits\n        the requested documents and/or information within the deadline, the secretariat,\n        notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 55 above, shall promptly finalize the summary\n        note and send it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of the requested\n        documents and/or information from the DOE. If the DOE does not submit the requested\n        documents and/or information by the deadline, the secretariat shall not process the\n        request submission any further.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n57.     If the request submission is removed from processing in accordance with paragraph 56\n        above, the DOE may request the secretariat, by email through a dedicated email address,\n        to make a telephone call or an internet-based call to the DOE to provide clarifications on\n        the issues identified if they are not clear enough to them. Only one such request shall be\n        allowed per request for deviation. In this case, the DOE shall provide the contact details\n        of the person to be called and the preferred time slots. The secretariat shall fix an\n        appointment for the call within three days of receipt of the request. The secretariat shall\n        record the call.\n58.     If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require\n        inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts, it shall send the case to an\n        appropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide inputs within seven days of receipt\n        of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall, notwithstanding the provisions in\n        paragraphs 55 and 56 above, finalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory\n        Body within 14 days of receipt of the inputs from the expert.\n59.     If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the\n        course of action referred to in paragraph 55 above within 14 days of receipt of the\n        summary note, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision\n        adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n60.     An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n        of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving the reasons in writing. The\n        secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the\n        Supervisory Body.\n61.     If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the\n        course of action more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case\n        shall be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall\n        be placed on the agenda of the subsequent Supervisory Body meeting.\n\n4.6.4.3.        Finalizing a request for deviation\n62.     If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting in accordance with paragraph 55\n        or 61 above, it shall decide on the course of action at the meeting.\n63.     The course of action shall be to:\n        (a)     Approve the deviation and allow submission of a request for registration with the\n                deviation; or\n        (b)     Reject the request.\n64.     Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n        DOE of the decision, the reasons thereof and any guidance provided by the Supervisory\n        Body as applicable, and make the decision, reasons and guidance publicly available on\n        the UNFCCC website by publishing a ruling note within three days of the decision of the\n        Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n4.6.4.4.

A request for registration of a proposed A6.4 project may be submitted any time after the\n        host Party has provided to the Supervisory Body an approval of the project in accordance\n        with paragraph 22(a) above and published on the UNFCCC website in accordance with\n\n11 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        paragraph 25 above but within one year of the publication of such approval. If the start\n        date of the crediting period of the proposed A6.4 project is a future date at the time of the\n        submission of the request for registration, the submission shall be made less than two\n        years before the start date of the crediting period.\n69.     The secretariat shall issue a statement of the registration fee due, or a confirmation that\n        no registration fee is due in accordance with the provisions on the registration fee detailed\n        in Appendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE.\n70.     The DOE shall communicate the registration fee due, or a confirmation that no registration\n        fee is due, to the activity participants.\n71.     The activity participants shall pay the registration fee by bank transfer, quoting the unique\n        project reference number referred to in paragraph 17 above, within one year of the\n        issuance to the DOE of the statement of the registration fee due.\n72.     The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website.

If the secretariat does not receive the deposit of the registration fee by the one-year\n        deadline referred to in paragraph 71 above, the request for registration shall be deemed\n        withdrawn. The same or a different DOE may submit a new request for registration of the\n        same proposed A6.4 project any time thereafter, following the applicable Article 6.4\n        mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of the new submission. In this case,\n        the original prior consideration notification published in accordance with paragraph 17\n        above remains valid for the new request for registration.\n\n5.1.2. Processing of request for registration\n74.     The secretariat shall maintain on the UNFCCC website a publicly available list of all\n        submitted requests for registration for which the applicable registration fee has been\n        received by the secretariat, or for which no registration fee is due. The secretariat shall\n        make publicly available the schedule and status of processing of each request for\n        registration. The secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of the\n        requests for registration in accordance with its operational plans, which incorporate\n        monthly quotas and any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body.\n75.     The secretariat shall commence the completeness check stage in accordance with the\n        established schedule. Upon commencement of the completeness check stage, the\n\n\n\n                                                  18 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        secretariat shall, subject to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct within\n        seven days a completeness check to determine whether the request for registration\n        submission is complete in accordance with the completeness check checklist for requests\n        for registration.\n76.     If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        consistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity\n        participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall\n        submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the\n        request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this\n        deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless\n        the DOE provides a justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested\n        documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended\n        accordingly.\n77.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        completeness check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of\n        the completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons\n        to the activity participants and the DOE and make this information available on the\n        UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for registration with\n        revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for registration is made within\n        28 days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-commence the completeness\n        check, otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for\n        registration.\n78.     Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject\n        to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct a substantive check within 21 days, in\n        accordance with the substantive check checklist for requests for registration.\n79.     If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or\n        missing basic information, it shall request the DOE, copying the activity participants, to\n        submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the\n        requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the request. If the\n        DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the\n        secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless the DOE\n        provides a justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested\n        documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended\n        accordingly.\n80.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        substantive check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of the\n        substantive check, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is\n        incomplete and communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants and the\n        DOE and make this information available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE\n        may resubmit the request for registration with revised documentation. If the resubmission\n        of the request for registration is made within 28 days of the notification, the secretariat\n        shall promptly re-commence the substantive check, otherwise the resubmission shall be\n        treated as a new submission of a request for registration.\n81.     Upon a positive conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall publish\n        the request for registration on the UNFCCC website, and it shall be deemed received by\n        the Supervisory Body for consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                  19 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n82.

Change to registered project\n\n6.2.1. General requirements\n119.    If a change occurred or is expected to occur to a registered A6.4 project, such change\n        (hereinafter referred to as post-registration change) shall be approved by the Supervisory\n        Body in accordance with this section to maintain the project’s registration status under the\n        Article 6.4 mechanism. The post-registration change shall fall within the scope of the\n        following acceptable change categories, and meet the associated conditions, as specified\n        in the activity standard:\n        (a)     Temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms\n                (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4\n                Environmental and social management plan form, and the A6.4 Sustainable\n                development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other\n                methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;\n        (b)     Permanent changes:\n                (i)     Corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of achieved\n                        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (ii)    Changes to the start date of the crediting period.\n                (iii)   Inclusion of a monitoring plan;\n                (iv)    Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool\n                        forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form,\n                        the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4\n                        Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring\n\n\n\n                                                  25 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                       from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or other\n                       methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;\n                (v)    Changes to the project design;\n        (c)     Registration or coverage under, or overlap with other, crediting schemes, other\n                frameworks or environmental markets.\n\n6.2.2. Update of documents and validation or verification\n120.    For the temporary deviation referred to in paragraph 119(a) above, the activity participants\n        shall describe the deviation in the monitoring report, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4\n        Environmental and social management plan form and/or A6.4 Sustainable development\n        impact form) in accordance with the activity standard as part of the preparation of a\n        monitoring report in accordance with section 7.1 and relevant provisions of the A6.4 SD\n        Tool, as applicable, for the monitoring period that covers the period during which the\n        temporary deviation occurred. The deviation shall be subsequently verified by a DOE for\n        requesting issuance for the monitoring period in accordance with sections 7.2 and 9.1\n        below.\n121.    For any of the permanent changes referred to in paragraph 119(b) above, the activity\n        participants shall revise the PDD to reflect the post-registration change. The activity\n        participants shall then submit the revised PDD and any other supporting documentation\n        to a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity\n        participants to perform validation of the post-registration change. If the activity participants\n        wish to appoint this DOE to submit the request for approval of post-registration change\n        under the issuance track referred to in paragraph 122 below, the selection of a DOE shall\n        follow the same rule referred to in paragraph 160 below. If the post-registration change\n        requires approval from the host Party in accordance with the activity standard, the activity\n        participants shall also submit the revised PDD to the secretariat and through which obtain\n        an approval from the host Party. In this case, the secretariat shall promptly publish the\n        revised PDD on the UNFCCC website, inform the host Party of the publication of the\n        revised PDD, and request the host Party to promptly respond to the publication, through\n        a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, either to approve or reject the post-\n        registration change. The timing of submitting the revised PDD to the secretariat shall be\n        at the discretion of the activity participants, either before, in parallel to, or after a DOE has\n        performed validation of the post-registration change.\n\n6.2.3. Submission of request for approval of post-registration change\n122.    After validating that the post-registration changes to the registered A6.4 project meets all\n        applicable requirements for post-registration changes in the activity standard by following\n        the applicable provisions of the validation and verification standard and other applicable\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a request for\n        approval of post-registration change. The request for approval shall be submitted either\n        prior to submitting a request for issuance of A6.4ERs that are affected by the post-\n        registration change (prior-approval track), or together with such request for issuance of\n        A6.4ERs (issuance track) in accordance with paragraph 125 below. The choice of whether\n        the DOE submits the request for approval via the prior-approval track or the issuance track\n        shall be at the discretion of the activity participants, who may wish to consider the\n        indicative list of post-registration changes that may be suitable for approval under the\n        issuance track outlined in Appendix 2.\n\n\n\n                                                  26 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n123.    A request for approval of post-registration change of the permanent changes referred to\n        in paragraph 119(b) above shall be submitted as follows, irrespective of whether it is under\n        the prior-approval track or the issuance track:\n        (a)     At any time for corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of\n                achieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n        (b)     No later than the first issuance request for inclusion of a monitoring plan;\n        (c)     No later than one year after the occurrence of the permanent changes to the\n                registered monitoring plan, permanent deviation of monitoring from the applied\n                methodologies, standardized baselines, or other methodological regulatory\n                documents, or the permanent change to the project design.\n124.    Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 119 above have occurred\n        or are expected to occur to the registered A6.4 project, the DOE shall, wherever possible,\n        combine these changes into a single request for approval of post-registration change.\n125.    Under both the prior-approval track and the issuance track, the DOE shall submit a request\n        for approval of post-registration change to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on\n        the UNFCCC website, attaching:\n        (a)     The revised PDD (in both clean and track-change versions) or a monitoring report,\n                as applicable, and any supporting documentation, prepared by the activity\n                participants in accordance with the activity standard;\n        (b)     The validation report on the post-registration change prepared by the DOE in\n                accordance with the validation and verification standard.\n126.

Change to modalities of communication\n\n6.3.1. General requirements\n134.    If there is a change to the MoC statement, the focal points for scope (b) referred to in\n        paragraph 34 above shall, request approval of the change from the secretariat as soon as\n        possible but no later than 90 days after the change takes place.\n135.    Authorized signatories or legal representatives of the activity participants, focal points, or\n        DNAs of the host Party or any other Parties participating in the A6.4 project may directly\n        notify the secretariat of any issues regarding the MoC statement through a designated e-\n        mail account provided in the mechanism registry section of the UNFCCC website. In this\n        case, the secretariat may request additional clarifications from the notifier. The secretariat\n        may contact any focal points or activity participants of the respective registered A6.4\n        project or, in cases of insolvency, liquidators or administrators, to request additional\n        clarifications. The secretariat shall advise the parties involved on further, including those\n        referred to in section 6.3.2 below.\n136.    The secretariat may request a new submission of an MoC statement whenever it identifies\n        or is notified of inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the MoC. The secretariat may provide\n        specific guidance for the resubmission. In its role as the mechanism registry administrator,\n        the secretariat may, after notifying the focal points and the activity participants, temporarily\n        put on hold the forwarding of A6.4ERs if the inconsistencies or inaccuracies prevent the\n        secretariat from establishing the focal points for scope of authority (a), pending resolution\n        of the inconsistencies or inaccuracies.\n137.    The focal points for scope (b) shall request approval of the change to the modalities of\n        communication to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n        uploading a new MoC statement using the valid version of the “Modalities of\n        communication statement form”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n138.    The focal points for scope (b) or the activity participants who submit a new MoC statement\n        in accordance with paragraph 147 below shall ensure that:\n        (a)     Supporting documentation, including powers of attorney, extracts from board\n                meeting minutes or company association documentation, or extracts/certificates\n                from national company registries that cannot be verified online, is dated or\n                notarized within six months from the time of submission of a request for change to\n                the MoC statement. This time limitation does not apply to copies of national\n                personal identity documents;\n        (b)     To the extent possible, changes applicable to more than one A6.4 project or\n                multiple changes affecting the same project are consolidated in a single change\n                request in accordance with the instructions provided in the mechanism registry\n                section of the UNFCCC website.\n139.    The legal representatives signing on behalf of the focal points or the activity participants\n        shall provide written evidence that they are authorized to sign on behalf of the respective\n        entities. The evidence shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph 138(a) above.\n140.    The secretariat shall process requests for changes to the MoC statement following the\n        steps described in sections 6.3.2–6.3.4 below. Wherever specific steps are not described,\n        the secretariat shall review the requests considering compliance with the documentary\n        requirements. In the absence of clear evidence to support a specific request, the\n        secretariat may request additional information prior to approving or rejecting the request.\n        In the case of a rejection, the secretariat shall provide reasons for the rejection and\n        additional guidance as appropriate.\n141.    The secretariat shall make detailed guidance available on the mechanism registry\n        section of the UNFCCC website on how to request changes to the activity participants and\n        focal points.\n142.

The activity participants or focal points may notify the secretariat of any issues regarding\n        the MoC statement, in accordance with paragraph 135 above, including those arising from\n        insolvency and/or disputes with regard to the designation or changes to the designation\n        of focal points.\n144.    The secretariat may engage the DNAs of the host Party or any other Parties participating\n        in the respective registered A6.4 project whenever issues arising from insolvency and/or\n        disputes over the designation of focal points are communicated to it. The secretariat may\n        provide information, subject to the confidentiality of such information, and/or administrative\n        assistance to the DNAs, upon request by the respective DNAs.\n145.    The secretariat, in its role as the mechanism registry administrator, may, after notifying\n        the focal points and the activity participants, temporarily put on hold the forwarding of\n        A6.4ERs for the registered A6.4 project for which the activity participants or the focal points\n        have communicated a case of insolvency and/or a dispute in relation to the MoC\n\n\n\n\n                                                  29 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        statement, pending resolution of the issues resulting from insolvency or resolution of the\n        disputes.\n146.    The secretariat shall display, subject to the confidentiality, indicative information related to\n        the notifications to the secretariat of issues arising from insolvency and/or of disputes on\n        the respective registered A6.4 project view page on the UNFCCC website, only in cases\n        where the forwarding of A6.4ERs has been temporarily put on hold pending the resolution\n        of the issues, in accordance with paragraph 145 above.\n\n6.3.3. Changes of focal points\n147.    Activity participants of a registered A6.4 project may change the designation of any focal\n        points for any reason and at any time by submitting a new MoC statement duly signed by\n        all activity participants, either through:\n        (a)     The focal points for scope of authority (b); or\n        (b)     Any of the activity participants, in cases of changes made to the MoC statement\n                excluding its annexes.\n148.    For changing the designation of focal points in accordance with paragraph 147 above, the\n        submission shall be made as follows:\n        (a)     A new MoC statement for changes related to designation of focal points, with the\n                exception of changes affecting only contact details and authorized signatories;\n        (b)     Annex 2 to the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication statement\n                form”, for changes related only to contact details and authorized signatories.\n149.    When a focal point who is not an activity participant is added to represent the activity\n        participants for any or all scopes of authority, the new MoC statement referred to in\n        paragraph 148(a) above shall be supported by written evidence of:\n        (a)     The new focal point’s corporate identity, if applicable and\n        (b)     The personal identity and employment status of the new focal point’s authorized\n                signatory(ies), including specimen signature(s).\n150.    The legal representative of a focal point for scope of authority (b) may submit a new\n        annex 2 to the MoC statement if the authorized signatory(ies) of the focal point concerned\n        is(are) no longer available.\n151.    Any focal point of a registered A6.4 project may request voluntary withdrawal from its role\n        as a focal point. Such a request shall cover all scopes of authority assumed by the focal\n        point. The voluntary withdrawal process shall follow the following steps:\n        (a)     The withdrawing focal point shall, directly or through the focal point for scope (b),\n                submit a withdrawal request to the secretariat including:\n                (i)    Annex 3 of the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication\n                       statement form”;\n                (ii)   Evidence of the written communication, sent by the withdrawing focal point\n                       to all other focal points and all activity participants, indicating its intention to\n                       withdraw from its role as a focal point, and inviting the designation of a new\n\n\n\n                                                  30 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                       focal point for the scope(s) of authority from which the focal point is\n                       withdrawing. Such written communications shall be made at least 30 days\n                       prior to the submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.\n        (b)     The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if found\n                complete, approve the withdrawal of the focal point. In doing so, the secretariat\n                may request clarification from the withdrawing focal point, or may contact any of\n                the other focal points or the activity participants to request additional clarifications;\n        (c)     Upon approval of the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat shall publish the\n                annex 3 of the MoC statement on the UNFCCC website. Additionally the secretariat\n                shall communicate the approval of the withdrawal of the focal point and its\n                implications on the MoC to all remaining focal points and activity participants of the\n                project;\n        (d)     The approved withdrawal of focal point shall have no effect on other focal points,\n                except in cases where the withdrawn focal point was part of joint or shared focal\n                point roles. In such cases, the remaining focal points shall continue to act in a sole,\n                shared or joint focal point role, as appropriate. If no focal point remains for a\n                specific scope of authority after the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat\n                shall notify the withdrawal to the remaining focal points for other scopes of\n                authority, or to all activity participants if no focal point remains. The activity\n                participants shall promptly designate a new focal point for any scope of authority\n                for which no focal point remains in accordance with the provisions of this section,\n                to enable further engagement with the Supervisory Body and the secretariat.\n\n6.3.4.

Within seven days of the commencement of the completeness\n        check stage, the secretariat shall, subject to the guidance of the Supervisory Body,\n        conduct a completeness check to determine whether the request for issuance submission\n        is complete in accordance with the completeness check checklist for requests for\n        issuance.\n186.    If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        consistency issues in the submission, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the\n        activity participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE\n        shall submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of\n        the request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by\n        this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete\n        unless the DOE provides a justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the\n        requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be\n        extended accordingly.\n187.    The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        completeness check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of\n        the completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons\n        to the activity participants and the DOE and make this information available on the\n        UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for issuance with\n        revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for issuance is made within 28\n        days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-commence the completeness\n        check again; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a\n        request for issuance.\n188.    Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject\n        to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct within 21 days a substantive check in\n        accordance with the substantive checklist for requests for issuance.\n189.    If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or\n        missing basic information, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity\n        participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall\n        submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the\n        request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this\n        deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless\n        the DOE provides a justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested\n        documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended\n        accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  38 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n190.    The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        substantive check stage.

If the DOE requests the withdrawal after the publication of the\n        request for issuance in accordance with paragraph 191 above, the request for issuance\n        shall be marked as “withdrawn”. The same or a different DOE may resubmit the request\n        for issuance at any time.\n230.    If activity participants wish to change the monitoring period covered by the monitoring\n        report corresponding to the withdrawn request for issuance, and if the final date of the\n        changed monitoring period is after when the DOE conducted an on-site inspection, the\n        same or different DOE shall undertake an additional on-site inspection, or determine if an\n        on-site inspection is necessary to duly perform its verification by following the applicable\n        provisions of the validation and verification standard. Following the verification, the DOE\n        may submit request for issuance for the changed monitoring period as a new submission.\n\n10. Renewal of crediting period\n10.1. General requirements\n231.    If the host Party has provided an approval of renewal of the crediting period of the project\n        at the time of its registration in accordance with paragraph 24(b) above, crediting period\n        of the project may be renewed in accordance with this section.\n232.    Renewal of the crediting period does not require a new approval from the host Party and\n        new authorization of activity participants from the host Party or other participating Parties.\n233.    The new crediting period shall start on the day immediately after the expiration of the\n        current crediting period irrespective of the date when the renewal of the crediting period is\n        approved by the Supervisory Body.\n234.    If the date when the renewal of the crediting period is approved by the Supervisory Body\n        is after the expiration of the current crediting period, and due to this delay or for any other\n        reasons, the monitoring temporarily does not comply with the monitoring plan in the\n        updated PDD approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall request\n        approval of a temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan in accordance with\n        the process for approval of post-registration changes outlined in section 6 above.\n\n10.2.

The activity participants shall\n        ensure that any changes to the list of activity participants in the PDD have been\n        communicated to the secretariat in accordance with section 6.3 above.\n236.    If activity participants plan to make or have made, a post-registration change to the project\n        design effective from the start date of the new crediting period, they shall clearly indicate\n\n\n\n                                                  44 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        the post-registration change in the new version of the PDD, distinguishing the change from\n        other update of information solely related to the renewal of the crediting period.\n237.    If a post-registration change becomes effective either before or after the renewal of the\n        crediting period, it shall not be included in a request for renewal of the crediting period.\n        Instead, the post-registration change shall be submitted for the Supervisory Body approval\n        separately in accordance with section 6 above before or after the submission of the\n        request for renewal of the crediting period, respectively.\n\n10.2.2. Validation of updated project design document\n238.    Activity participants shall submit the new version of the PDD to any DOE accredited in the\n        relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participants to perform the\n        validation for renewal of the crediting period.\n239.    The DOE shall validate that the updated project design complies with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n        and requirements based on the information provided in the new version of the PDD and\n        any supporting documentation it has received from the activity participants and any further\n        information obtained during the validation activity. The DOE shall prepare a validation\n        report, in accordance with the validation and verification standard, using the “Validation\n        report form for renewal of the crediting period for projects”.\n240.    For the purpose of potential selection of the validation activity for performance assessment\n        of the DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”, the DOE shall\n        notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the\n        scheduled site inspection for the A6.4 project, which is to be conducted in accordance with\n        the validation and verification standard, no later than four weeks prior to the inspection.\n\n10.2.3. Submission of request for renewal\n241.    The DOE shall submit a request for renewal of the crediting period to the secretariat, after\n        validating that the project design updated for renewal of the crediting period and described\n        in the new version of the PDD meets all applicable requirements for renewal of the\n        crediting period in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism\n        rules and requirements. The request for renewal shall be submitted through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website, including the reference to the notification of the timing\n        of the site inspection made in accordance with paragraph 240 above, along with the\n        following attachments:\n        (a)     The new version of the PDD prepared by the activity participants in accordance\n                with paragraph 235 above and validated by the DOE in accordance with\n                paragraph 239 above;\n        (b)     The validation report prepared by the DOE in accordance with paragraph 239\n                above.\n242.    A request for renewal of the crediting period shall be submitted no earlier than 270 days\n        prior to, but no later than one year after, the expiration of the crediting period. If a\n        submission was made after this deadline, the crediting period of the project may no longer\n        be renewed. The secretariat shall send a reminder to the activity participants 270 days\n        prior to the expiry of the crediting period, including information on the consequence of\n        missing the deadline.\n\n\n\n                                                  45 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n243.    Notwithstanding paragraph 242 above, for projects that transitioned from the UNFCCC\n        Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to the Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with\n        the “Procedure for transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism”, if the crediting\n        period ended or will end after 31 December 2020, the request for renewal of the crediting\n        period shall be submitted within one year of the approval by the Supervisory Body of the\n        transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism or within one year of the applicable Article 6.4\n        methodology becomes available, whichever occurs later.\n244.    The secretariat shall issue a statement of the renewal fee due, or confirmation that no\n        renewal fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions on the renewal fee\n        contained in Appendix 1, and shall communicate it to the DOE.\n245.    The process for payment of the renewal fee by the activity participants, submission of a\n        proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of no payment of the renewal fee by\n        the deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions for the registration fee outlined in\n        paragraph 70−73 above, mutatis mutandis. If the secretariat does not receive the deposit\n        of the renewal fee by the one-year deadline, the crediting period of the A6.4 project may\n        no longer be renewed in accordance with the condition referred to in paragraph 242 above.\n\n10.2.4. Processing of request for renewal\n246.    For processing of the request for renewal of the crediting period, the provisions in\n        section 5.1.2 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n10.2.5. Requesting review of request for renewal\n247.    For requesting review of the request for renewal of the crediting period, the provisions in\n        section 5.1.3 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n10.2.6. Finalizing request for renewal if no request for review\n248.    For finalizing the request for renewal of the crediting period if no request for review is\n        received by the secretariat within the 28-day deadline, the provisions in section 5.1.4\n        above shall apply mutatis mutandis, except for the start of the new crediting period, which\n        shall be the day immediately following the end of the previous crediting period in\n        accordance with paragraph 233 above regardless of when the renewal of the crediting\n        period is approved by the Supervisory Body.\n\n10.2.7. Review of request for renewal of crediting period\n249.    For a review of the request for renewal of the crediting period, the provisions in section 5.2\n        above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n10.2.8. Withdrawal of request for renewal of crediting period\n250.    For a withdrawal of the request for renewal of the crediting period, the provisions in\n        section 5.3 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  46 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n11. Voluntary deregistration of project\n11.1. Submission of request for deregistration\n251.    Activity participants of a registered A6.4 project may submit to the secretariat, through the\n        focal point for scope (c) referred to in paragraph 34 above, a request for deregistration of\n        the project through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, attaching written\n        agreement of all activity participants of the deregistration using the “Project deregistration\n        no-objection form”.\n\n11.2. Processing of request for deregistration\n252.    The secretariat shall, as soon as possible, and in any case striving to do so within five\n        days of receipt of the request for deregistration, conduct a completeness check of the\n        request and attached written no-objections from all activity participants.\n253.    If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies missing information, it shall\n        request the activity participants to revise the request and/or submit revised written no-\n        objections, providing the missing information. In this case, the activity participants shall\n        revise the request and/or submit revised written no-objections through the dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website. Upon receipt of the complete request and written no-\n        objections, the secretariat shall resume processing the request.\n254.    Upon conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall notify the activity\n        participants of the conclusion of the completeness check and publish the request for\n        deregistration on the UNFCCC website. The request for deregistration shall be deemed\n        received by the Supervisory Body.\n255.    The secretariat shall promptly inform the Supervisory Body of the receipt of the request\n        for deregistration and mark the A6.4 project as “deregistered’’ on the UNFCCC website.\n256.    The secretariat shall inform the host Party and other participating Parties of the\n        deregistration of the A6.4 project.\n\n11.3. Effects of deregistration\n257.    The effective date of deregistration shall be the date when the secretariat received a\n        complete submission of the request for deregistration.\n258.    A DOE may submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs in accordance with section 9.1.1\n        above for the deregistered A6.4 project for the period prior to the effective date of\n        deregistration.\n259.    A DOE shall not make any request for issuance that covers the monitoring period including\n        any date that is on or after the effective date of deregistration. The mechanism registry\n        administrator shall not issue A6.4ERs for the deregistered A6.4 project for the period from\n        the effective date of deregistration.\n260.    An A6.4 project that has been deregistered may not be reregistered under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism or included as a component project activity in a registered A6.4 programme\n        of activities.\n261.    The registration fee shall not be reimbursed for a deregistered A6.4 project.\n\n\n\n                                                  47 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n11.4. Administration period\n262.    During the period from the effective date of deregistration of an A6.4 project until the date\n        that is three calendar years later:\n        (a)     The secretariat shall communicate with the activity participants, the host Party and\n                other participating Parties in order to assist them to settle outstanding matters in\n                relation to the deregistered A6.4 project, including the completion of all issuance\n                requests and forwarding requests in respect of GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals achieved prior to the effective date of deregistration, and such other\n                steps as are necessary to ensure the completion of outstanding matters in relation\n                to the deregistered A6.4 project;\n        (b)     Each activity participant may, after the effective date of deregistration, where\n                necessary, be treated as if it were still an activity participant by the Supervisory\n                Body and the secretariat for the purposes of the activity standard and this\n                procedure in order to allow the secretariat to process instructions relating to GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved prior to the effective date of\n                deregistration from such activity participant in relation to the deregistered A6.4\n                project.\n\n12. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorization of\n    activity participant\n12.1. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant\n\n12.1.1. Submission of withdrawal notification\n263.    The host Party of a proposed or registered A6.4 project may, through its DNA, submit a\n        notification to the secretariat to withdraw the approval of the project or the authorization of\n        any of the activity participants made in accordance with paragraphs 23‒24 above any time\n        through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the following\n        information:\n        (a)     The project title and its unique UNFCCC reference number;\n        (b)     The type of withdrawal (either withdrawal of approval of project or withdrawal of\n                authorization of activity participants);\n        (c)     The names of activity participants to whom the withdrawal of authorization applies\n                (if the withdrawal only relates to the authorization of activity participants);\n        (d)     The effective date of the withdrawal, which shall be at least 60 days after the date\n                of the notification of the withdrawal unless the host Party specifies an earlier date\n                with justification;\n        (e)     The reason(s) for the withdrawal.\n264.    Other participating Parties may withdraw the authorization of activity participants made in\n        accordance with paragraph 26 above, through their DNAs, any time through the dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the information listed in paragraph 263(a)−(e)\n        above.\n\n\n\n                                                  48 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n265.    Upon receipt of the withdrawal notification, the secretariat shall promptly inform the\n        affected activity participants of the notification and check whether the information provided\n        is complete. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall request the DNAs of the Parties\n        submitting the withdrawal to provide the missing information.\n266.    The secretariat shall publish the withdrawal of the approval of the project and/or the\n        authorization of activity participants on the UNFCCC website on the effective date of the\n        withdrawal.\n267.    If the host Party withdraws the approval of the project:\n        (a)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is before the DOE submits a request for\n                registration of the project in accordance with paragraph 67 above, such request\n                may not be submitted;\n        (b)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the DOE has submitted of a request\n                for registration but before the final decision of the Supervisory Body on the request,\n                the request shall not be processed;\n        (c)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the final decision of the Supervisory\n                Body to register the project, the provisions outlined in paragraph 268 below shall\n                apply.\n\n12.1.2. Impact of withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant\n268.    For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party withdrew its approval, requests for\n        issuance of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project before\n        to the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline specified in\n        paragraph 177 above. Consequently, the A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with\n        sections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover a monitoring\n        period from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the project.\n269.    For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party or other participating Parties only\n        withdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project may still be\n        submitted until the deadline specified in paragraph 177 above. Consequently, the\n        A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity\n        participant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance\n        and distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn\n        shall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the project for the monitoring\n        period prior to the date of the withdrawal of the authorization.\n\n13. Appeals and grievances\n270.    Stakeholders, the activity participants, the host Party and other participating Parties,\n        through their DNAs, may appeal decisions of the Supervisory Body or request that a\n        grievance be addressed in accordance with paragraphs 89, 103, 198 and 214 above and\n        the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  49 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. Fee schedule\n\n1.     Background\n1.      This Appendix outlines the fee rates payable by the activity participants of a proposed or\n        registered Article 6, paragraph 4, mechanism projects (A6.4 projects). These fees are\n        intended to cover the administrative expenses for processing requests submitted at\n        various stage of the Article 6, paragraph 4, mechanism (the Article 6.4 mechanism) activity\n        cycle. This Appendix also details the rules of reimbursement of paid fees where requests\n        are withdrawn by the submitting designated operations entities (DOEs), concluded as\n        incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected by the Supervisory Body.\n2.      The fee types and rates are set based on the decisions made by the Conference of the\n        Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) relating to the\n        share of proceeds to cover administrative expenses as outlined in decision 3/CMA3,\n        annex, paragraphs 48, and chapter VII, as elaborated in decision 7/CMA.4, annex I,\n        chapter V.\n\n2.     General\n3.      In accordance with the relevant sections of this procedure, fees outlined in this\n        Appendix shall be paid at the time of submission of the respective requests. The initiation\n        of processing of a request shall be subject to the payment of the fee.\n4.      All fees referred to in this Appendix shall be waived for projects hosted in the least\n        developed countries and small island developing States.\n5.      The Supervisory Body may adjust and implement the fee structure and levels within the\n        boundary set by the CMA in its decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapter V, on the basis of the\n        guiding principles of balancing the income and the expenditure, enabling long-term sound\n        operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism, being fair to activity participants, ensuring\n        administrative efficiency and providing predictability to activity participants and the\n        Supervisory Body.\n\n3.     Registration fee\n6.      The fee for a request for registration of a proposed A6.4 project (the registration fee) shall\n        be fixed and tiered based on the estimated annual average greenhouse gas (GHG)\n        emission reductions or net GHG removals over the first crediting period, if it is renewable,\n        or over the entire crediting period, if it is fixed, as follows:\n        (a)     USD 1,500 for a project achieving annual average GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals over the (first) crediting period of up to 15,000 tonnes of carbon\n                dioxide equivalent (t CO2 eq);\n        (b)     USD 5,000 for a project achieving annual average GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals over the (first) crediting period of between 15,001 and 50,000 t CO2\n                eq;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     USD 10,000 for a project achieving annual average GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals over the (first) crediting period exceeding 50,000 t CO2 eq.\n7.      If the request for registration is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the\n        secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this procedure, the paid\n        registration fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage, or removed due to the withdrawal of host\n                Party approval;\n        (b)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 1,500 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the completeness check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for registration within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 77 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (c)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 5,000 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the substantive check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for registration within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 80 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (d)     No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the substantive\n                check stage or rejected by the Supervisory Body.\n\n4.     Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool consideration fee\n8.      The fee for consideration of a request for deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4\n        SD Tool shall be set at USD 1,500 per request.\n9.      If the request for deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool is withdrawn by\n        the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body,\n        the paid deviation fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following\n        manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage in accordance with this procedure;\n        (b)     No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage.\n\n5.     Post-registration change fee\n10.     The fee for a request for approval of post-registration change to a registered A6.4 project\n        (the post-registration change fee) shall be set at USD 1,500 per request.\n11.     If the post-registration change increases the scale of the project to bring the scale to a\n        higher tier of the registration fee, the difference between the paid registration fee\n        calculated in accordance with paragraph 6 above and the newly calculated fee shall be\n        paid in addition to the post-registration change fee. For any other post-registration\n        changes, any portion of the paid registration fee shall not be reimbursable.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  51 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n12.     If the request for approval of post-registration change is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded\n        as incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body, the paid post-\n        registration fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage in accordance with this procedure;\n        (b)     No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage.\n\n6.     Issuance fee\n13.     The fee for a request for issuance of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs)\n        for a registered A6.4 project (the issuance fee) shall be a proportional levy to the amount\n        of A6.4ERs requested for issuance, set at USD 0.15 per A6.4ER requested for issuance.\n14.     If the request for issuance is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the\n        secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this procedure, the paid\n        issuance fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage;\n        (b)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 1,500 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the completeness check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for issuance within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 187 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (c)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 5,000 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the substantive check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for issuance within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 190 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (d)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 10,000 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE any time after the substantive check stage or rejected by the Supervisory\n                Body.\n15.     If, as a result of the substantive check by the secretariat or the review by the Supervisory\n        Body of the request for issuance, the quantity of A6.4ERs to be issued changed from that\n        in the initial request for issuance, the activity participants or the secretariat shall settle the\n        difference in the issuance fees if the difference is more than USD 300.\n\n7.     Renewal fee\n16.     The fee for a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project\n        (renewal fee) shall be at the same rate as the registration fee specified in paragraph 6\n        above, based on the scale of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals of the\n        project.\n17.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The CMA, at its sixth session, elaborated provisions of the RMPs relating to the\n          authorization of the use of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs) and\n          exemption from the share of proceeds for adaptation for least developed countries (LDCs)\n          and small island developing States (SIDS).4\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable\n          development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool) that provides means for\n          activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory requirements for\n          identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for assessing and\n          enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to sustainable development in line with\n          sustainable development objectives and priorities of the host Party and the sustainable\n          development goals.\n5.        The Supervisory Body, at its sixteenth meeting, adopted revisions to the “Standard: Article\n          6.4 activity standard for projects” (AS-P) which, among other things, included the relevant\n          requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. Additionally, the AS-P included new provisions allowing\n          activity participants to request a deviation through a DOE to the Supervisory Body prior to\n          submitting a request for registration or request for issuance if the DOE or the activity\n          participants identifies the presence of unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the\n          environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by\n          consultation or mitigation.\n\n\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex.

If the design of the proposed A6.4 project has undergone changes after the publication of\n         the PDD for global stakeholder consultation, the DOE shall determine whether these\n\n9   See footnote 8 above.\n\n\n\n                                                  11 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        changes are significant. If the changes are determined by the DOE to be significant, the\n        DOE shall request the activity participants to make a revised PDD publicly available for\n        global stakeholder consultation. The DOE or the activity participant may seek guidance\n        from the Supervisory Body on whether a revised PDD shall be published for global\n        stakeholder consultation by submitting such a request in accordance with the “Procedure:\n        Direct communication with stakeholders”.\n29.     The Supervisory Body shall expeditiously consider the case, through electronic means\n        where possible, and provide guidance to the DOE and/or the activity participants. In doing\n        so, the Supervisory Body shall consider the significance of the changes in terms of the\n        impact on the application of the applied methodologies, the other methodological\n        regulatory documents and local stakeholders.\n30.     If the activity participants wish to deviate from the selected mechanism methodology when\n        applying it to the proposed A6.4 project, they shall, prior to the preparation of the PDD,\n        submit a request for clarification to the secretariat on whether such deviation is acceptable\n        in accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of baseline\n        and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”.\n31.     If unavoidable negative impacts are identified by activity participants that exceed the\n        environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by\n        consultation or mitigation, activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE\n        as per the process for requesting a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD\n        Tool described in section 4.6.4 below.\n\n4.6.2. Modalities of communication statement\n32.     The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 project shall designate one or more focal\n        point entities (hereinafter referred to as focal points) to communicate on their behalf with\n        the Supervisory Body and the secretariat within the defined scopes of authority referred to\n        in paragraph 34 below, and include this information in a modalities of communication\n        (MoC) statement using the “Modalities of communication statement form”.\n33.     After the submission of a request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project in\n        accordance with paragraph 67 below, all official communication between the activity\n        participants and the Supervisory Body or the secretariat for the project shall be conducted\n        in accordance with the MoC statement, with the exception of communications undertaken\n        in accordance with paragraphs 135 and 147(b) below.\n34.     The activity participants shall grant the focal points the authority to:\n        (a)     Communicate in relation to requests for forwarding of A6.4ERs to individual\n                accounts of the activity participants (scope (a)); and/or\n        (b)     Communicate in relation to changes to the MoC statement (scope (b)); and/or\n        (c)     Communicate on all other project-related matters not covered by (a) or (b) above\n                (scope (c)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n35.     The activity participants may designate one or multiple entities for each scope of authority\n        in a sole, shared or joint focal point role.10\n36.     The activity participants and the focal points may designate one primary authorized\n        signatory and one alternate authorized signatory. The authentication of either the primary\n        or alternate authorized signatory shall suffice for authenticating the activity participant’s or\n        the focal point’s consent or instruction(s). If an entity serves as both an activity participant\n        and a focal point, the same signatory shall represent the entity in both roles.\n37.     The activity participants may voluntarily indicate in the MoC statement the end date of their\n        participation in the proposed A6.4 project. The secretariat shall monitor the end date of\n        participation and mark the activity participants as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website on\n        the day after the end date, provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the\n        host Party of the project remains. The activity participants whose participation in the\n        project has ended may request to be re-included as an activity participant in the same\n        project at any time thereafter in accordance with paragraph 152(a) below.\n38.     The secretariat shall, when conducting the completeness check of the request for\n        registration in accordance with paragraphs 75−77 below, consider the contact details\n        included in the MoC statement to be the valid contact details of the activity participants\n        whenever such details differ from the details of the activity participants and their\n        representatives included in the PDD of the proposed A6.4 project.\n39.     The secretariat shall publish non-confidential information included in the MoC statement\n        on the respective A6.4 project webpage of the UNFCCC website, following the registration\n        of the project under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n4.6.3. Validation of project design document\n40.     The activity participants shall submit the PDD published for the global stakeholder\n        consultation or any later version of the PDD, along with the MoC statement, a declaration\n        that the development, implementation and operation of the proposed A6.4 project do not\n        involve any illegal activities and any supporting documentation to a DOE accredited in the\n        relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participants to perform validation\n        of the project for registration.\n41.     The DOE shall perform validation of whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with the\n        relevant requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4\n        mechanism rules and requirements based on the information provided in the PDD, the\n        MoC statement, any supporting documentation it has received from the activity\n        participants and any further information obtained during the validation activity. The DOE\n        shall prepare a validation report in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and\n        verification standard for projects” (hereinafter referred to as the validation and verification\n        standard), using the “Validation report form for projects”.\n42.     For the purpose of potential selection of the validation activity for performance assessment\n        of the DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”, the DOE shall\n        notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the\n\n\n10 Joint focal point role requires consent from all focal point entities to communicate with the Supervisory\n\n  Body or the secretariat. Shared focal point role allows any focal point entity to communicate with the\n  Supervisory Body or the secretariat without requiring consent from other focal point entities.\n\n\n\n                                                  13 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        scheduled site inspection for the proposed A6.4 project which is to be conducted in\n        accordance with the validation and verification standard, no later than four weeks prior to\n        the inspection.\n\n4.6.4. Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool\n\n4.6.4.1.        Submission of a request for deviation\n43.     The DOE may submit a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool to the\n        secretariat and seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a\n        deviation. Such deviation may be submitted when the activity participants prior to\n        validation or the DOE during validation have identified the presence of unavoidable\n        impacts that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria, and\n        that cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation.\n44.     To seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of the deviation, the\n        DOE shall submit a “Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool request\n        form” and additional documentation through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n        website. In the submission, the DOE shall provide:\n        (a)     A clear and precise assessment of the case, based on evidence provided by the\n                activity participant as per the activity standard, including input from local\n                stakeholders if any;\n        (b)     A description of the impact of the deviation on social, environmental and\n                sustainable development impacts from the proposed project;\n        (c)     A draft PDD with a completed section A: Project description and Section D:\n                Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts\n                including its Appendixes 6 (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                assessment form), 7 (A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form)\n                and/or 8 (A6.4 Sustainable development impact form).\n\n4.6.4.2.        Processing of request for deviation\n45.     The secretariat shall issue a statement of the deviation consideration fee due, or\n        confirmation that no fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions on the fee\n        contained in Appendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE.\n46.     The DOE shall communicate to the activity participants the deviation consideration fee\n        due, or a confirmation that no fee is due.\n47.     The activity participants shall pay the deviation consideration fee by bank transfer, quoting\n        the unique project reference number referred to in paragraph 17 above, within 30 days of\n        the issuance to the DOE of the statement of the deviation consideration fee due.\n48.     The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website.\n49.     If the secretariat does not receive the deviation consideration fee by the 30-day deadline\n        referred to in paragraph 47 above, the request for deviation shall be deemed withdrawn.\n        The DOE may submit a new request for deviation of the same proposed A6.4 project\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        anytime thereafter, following the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements\n        valid at the time of the new submission.\n50.     The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted requests for deviation\n        on the UNFCCC website for which the applicable fee has been received by the secretariat\n        or for which no fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly available the schedule of\n        processing the requests for deviation, including the expected date of commencement. The\n        secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of the requests for\n        deviation in accordance with the secretariat’s operational plans – that is, monthly quotas\n        – which shall also incorporate any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body.\n51.     The secretariat shall commence the processing of the request for deviation in accordance\n        with the schedule. The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check within seven days\n        to determine whether the request submission is complete in accordance with\n        paragraph 44 above.\n52.     If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        inconsistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE, by e-mail, to submit revised\n        documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the requested\n        documents and/or information within two days of receipt of the request. If the DOE does\n        not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat\n        shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless the DOE provides a\n        justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested documents and/or\n        information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly.\n53.     The secretariat shall notify the DOE of the conclusion of the completeness check. If the\n        request submission is found incomplete, the secretariat shall also communicate the\n        underlying reasons to the DOE and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n        In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for deviation with revised documentation.\n        If the resubmission of the request for deviation is made within 28 days of the notification,\n        the secretariat shall promptly commence the completeness check again; otherwise the\n        resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for deviation.\n54.     Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall publish the\n        request for deviation on the UNFCCC website, and the request for deviation shall be\n        deemed received by the Supervisory Body for consideration.\n55.     Within 14 days of the date of publication of the request for deviation, the secretariat shall\n        prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for deviation\n        including a recommendation on the course of action, or with a notification that the case\n        will be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting.\n56.     If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require\n        clarifications from the DOE, it shall request the DOE to submit revised documents and/or\n        information to clarify the issues within 14 days of receipt of the request. If the DOE submits\n        the requested documents and/or information within the deadline, the secretariat,\n        notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 55 above, shall promptly finalize the summary\n        note and send it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of the requested\n        documents and/or information from the DOE. If the DOE does not submit the requested\n        documents and/or information by the deadline, the secretariat shall not process the\n        request submission any further.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n57.     If the request submission is removed from processing in accordance with paragraph 56\n        above, the DOE may request the secretariat, by email through a dedicated email address,\n        to make a telephone call or an internet-based call to the DOE to provide clarifications on\n        the issues identified if they are not clear enough to them. Only one such request shall be\n        allowed per request for deviation. In this case, the DOE shall provide the contact details\n        of the person to be called and the preferred time slots. The secretariat shall fix an\n        appointment for the call within three days of receipt of the request. The secretariat shall\n        record the call.\n58.     If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require\n        inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts, it shall send the case to an\n        appropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide inputs within seven days of receipt\n        of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall, notwithstanding the provisions in\n        paragraphs 55 and 56 above, finalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory\n        Body within 14 days of receipt of the inputs from the expert.\n59.     If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the\n        course of action referred to in paragraph 55 above within 14 days of receipt of the\n        summary note, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision\n        adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n60.     An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n        of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving the reasons in writing. The\n        secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the\n        Supervisory Body.\n61.     If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the\n        course of action more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case\n        shall be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall\n        be placed on the agenda of the subsequent Supervisory Body meeting.\n\n4.6.4.3.        Finalizing a request for deviation\n62.     If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting in accordance with paragraph 55\n        or 61 above, it shall decide on the course of action at the meeting.\n63.     The course of action shall be to:\n        (a)     Approve the deviation and allow submission of a request for registration with the\n                deviation; or\n        (b)     Reject the request.\n64.     Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n        DOE of the decision, the reasons thereof and any guidance provided by the Supervisory\n        Body as applicable, and make the decision, reasons and guidance publicly available on\n        the UNFCCC website by publishing a ruling note within three days of the decision of the\n        Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n4.6.4.4.

If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        consistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity\n        participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall\n        submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the\n        request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this\n        deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless\n        the DOE provides a justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested\n        documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended\n        accordingly.\n77.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        completeness check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of\n        the completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons\n        to the activity participants and the DOE and make this information available on the\n        UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for registration with\n        revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for registration is made within\n        28 days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-commence the completeness\n        check, otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for\n        registration.\n78.     Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject\n        to the guidance of the Supervisory Body, conduct a substantive check within 21 days, in\n        accordance with the substantive check checklist for requests for registration.\n79.     If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or\n        missing basic information, it shall request the DOE, copying the activity participants, to\n        submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the\n        requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the request. If the\n        DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the\n        secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless the DOE\n        provides a justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested\n        documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended\n        accordingly.\n80.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        substantive check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of the\n        substantive check, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is\n        incomplete and communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants and the\n        DOE and make this information available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE\n        may resubmit the request for registration with revised documentation. If the resubmission\n        of the request for registration is made within 28 days of the notification, the secretariat\n        shall promptly re-commence the substantive check, otherwise the resubmission shall be\n        treated as a new submission of a request for registration.\n81.     Upon a positive conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall publish\n        the request for registration on the UNFCCC website, and it shall be deemed received by\n        the Supervisory Body for consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                  19 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n82.

The activity\n        participants shall then submit the revised PDD and any other supporting documentation\n        to a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity\n        participants to perform validation of the post-registration change. If the activity participants\n        wish to appoint this DOE to submit the request for approval of post-registration change\n        under the issuance track referred to in paragraph 122 below, the selection of a DOE shall\n        follow the same rule referred to in paragraph 160 below. If the post-registration change\n        requires approval from the host Party in accordance with the activity standard, the activity\n        participants shall also submit the revised PDD to the secretariat and through which obtain\n        an approval from the host Party. In this case, the secretariat shall promptly publish the\n        revised PDD on the UNFCCC website, inform the host Party of the publication of the\n        revised PDD, and request the host Party to promptly respond to the publication, through\n        a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, either to approve or reject the post-\n        registration change. The timing of submitting the revised PDD to the secretariat shall be\n        at the discretion of the activity participants, either before, in parallel to, or after a DOE has\n        performed validation of the post-registration change.\n\n6.2.3. Submission of request for approval of post-registration change\n122.    After validating that the post-registration changes to the registered A6.4 project meets all\n        applicable requirements for post-registration changes in the activity standard by following\n        the applicable provisions of the validation and verification standard and other applicable\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a request for\n        approval of post-registration change. The request for approval shall be submitted either\n        prior to submitting a request for issuance of A6.4ERs that are affected by the post-\n        registration change (prior-approval track), or together with such request for issuance of\n        A6.4ERs (issuance track) in accordance with paragraph 125 below. The choice of whether\n        the DOE submits the request for approval via the prior-approval track or the issuance track\n        shall be at the discretion of the activity participants, who may wish to consider the\n        indicative list of post-registration changes that may be suitable for approval under the\n        issuance track outlined in Appendix 2.\n\n\n\n                                                  26 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n123.    A request for approval of post-registration change of the permanent changes referred to\n        in paragraph 119(b) above shall be submitted as follows, irrespective of whether it is under\n        the prior-approval track or the issuance track:\n        (a)     At any time for corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of\n                achieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n        (b)     No later than the first issuance request for inclusion of a monitoring plan;\n        (c)     No later than one year after the occurrence of the permanent changes to the\n                registered monitoring plan, permanent deviation of monitoring from the applied\n                methodologies, standardized baselines, or other methodological regulatory\n                documents, or the permanent change to the project design.\n124.    Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 119 above have occurred\n        or are expected to occur to the registered A6.4 project, the DOE shall, wherever possible,\n        combine these changes into a single request for approval of post-registration change.\n125.    Under both the prior-approval track and the issuance track, the DOE shall submit a request\n        for approval of post-registration change to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on\n        the UNFCCC website, attaching:\n        (a)     The revised PDD (in both clean and track-change versions) or a monitoring report,\n                as applicable, and any supporting documentation, prepared by the activity\n                participants in accordance with the activity standard;\n        (b)     The validation report on the post-registration change prepared by the DOE in\n                accordance with the validation and verification standard.\n126.    The secretariat shall issue a statement of the post-registration change fee due, or\n        confirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with\n        the provisions on the post-registration change fee contained in Appendix 1, and shall\n        communicate it to the DOE.\n127.    The processes for payment of the post-registration change fee by the activity participants\n        and submission of proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of non-payment\n        of the post-registration change fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding\n        provisions for the registration fee contained in paragraphs 70−73 above, mutatis mutandis.\n        The secretariat shall publish the submitted request for post-registration change on the\n        UNFCCC website after receiving the proof of payment of the post-registration change fee.\n\n6.2.4. Processing of request for approval of post-registration change\n128.    For processing of the request for approval of post-registration change, the provisions in\n        section 5.1.2 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n129.    Notwithstanding paragraph 128 above, for cases of post-registration changes relating to\n        the A6.4 SD Tool forms, if the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note,\n        identifies issues that require inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts,\n        it shall send the case to an appropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide their\n        inputs within seven days of the receipt of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall,\n        notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 84 above, finalize the summary note and send\n        it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of the inputs from the expert.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5. Requesting review of request for approval of post-registration change\n130.    For requesting review of the request for approval of post-registration change, the\n        provisions in section 5.1.3 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.2.6. Finalizing request for approval of post-registration change if no request for review\n131.    For finalizing the request for approval of post-registration change if no request for review\n        is received by the secretariat within the 28-day deadline, the provisions in section 5.1.4\n        above shall apply mutatis mutandis, except for the provision on the start date of the\n        crediting period, which is not applicable.\n\n6.2.7. Review of request for approval of post-registration change\n132.    For a review of the request for approval of post-registration change, the provisions in\n        section 5.2 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.2.8. Withdrawal of request for approval of post-registration change\n133.    For a withdrawal of the request for approval of post-registration change, the provisions in\n        section 5.3 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.3.    Change to modalities of communication\n\n6.3.1. General requirements\n134.    If there is a change to the MoC statement, the focal points for scope (b) referred to in\n        paragraph 34 above shall, request approval of the change from the secretariat as soon as\n        possible but no later than 90 days after the change takes place.\n135.    Authorized signatories or legal representatives of the activity participants, focal points, or\n        DNAs of the host Party or any other Parties participating in the A6.4 project may directly\n        notify the secretariat of any issues regarding the MoC statement through a designated e-\n        mail account provided in the mechanism registry section of the UNFCCC website. In this\n        case, the secretariat may request additional clarifications from the notifier. The secretariat\n        may contact any focal points or activity participants of the respective registered A6.4\n        project or, in cases of insolvency, liquidators or administrators, to request additional\n        clarifications. The secretariat shall advise the parties involved on further, including those\n        referred to in section 6.3.2 below.\n136.    The secretariat may request a new submission of an MoC statement whenever it identifies\n        or is notified of inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the MoC. The secretariat may provide\n        specific guidance for the resubmission. In its role as the mechanism registry administrator,\n        the secretariat may, after notifying the focal points and the activity participants, temporarily\n        put on hold the forwarding of A6.4ERs if the inconsistencies or inaccuracies prevent the\n        secretariat from establishing the focal points for scope of authority (a), pending resolution\n        of the inconsistencies or inaccuracies.\n137.    The focal points for scope (b) shall request approval of the change to the modalities of\n        communication to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n        uploading a new MoC statement using the valid version of the “Modalities of\n        communication statement form”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n138.    The focal points for scope (b) or the activity participants who submit a new MoC statement\n        in accordance with paragraph 147 below shall ensure that:\n        (a)     Supporting documentation, including powers of attorney, extracts from board\n                meeting minutes or company association documentation, or extracts/certificates\n                from national company registries that cannot be verified online, is dated or\n                notarized within six months from the time of submission of a request for change to\n                the MoC statement. This time limitation does not apply to copies of national\n                personal identity documents;\n        (b)     To the extent possible, changes applicable to more than one A6.4 project or\n                multiple changes affecting the same project are consolidated in a single change\n                request in accordance with the instructions provided in the mechanism registry\n                section of the UNFCCC website.\n139.    The legal representatives signing on behalf of the focal points or the activity participants\n        shall provide written evidence that they are authorized to sign on behalf of the respective\n        entities. The evidence shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph 138(a) above.\n140.    The secretariat shall process requests for changes to the MoC statement following the\n        steps described in sections 6.3.2–6.3.4 below. Wherever specific steps are not described,\n        the secretariat shall review the requests considering compliance with the documentary\n        requirements. In the absence of clear evidence to support a specific request, the\n        secretariat may request additional information prior to approving or rejecting the request.\n        In the case of a rejection, the secretariat shall provide reasons for the rejection and\n        additional guidance as appropriate.\n141.    The secretariat shall make detailed guidance available on the mechanism registry\n        section of the UNFCCC website on how to request changes to the activity participants and\n        focal points.\n142.    The secretariat shall display the effective date of the new MoC statement on the\n        corresponding A6.4 project dedicated view page on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.3.2. Reported issues resulting from insolvency and/or disputes on modalities of\n       communication\n143.    The activity participants or focal points may notify the secretariat of any issues regarding\n        the MoC statement, in accordance with paragraph 135 above, including those arising from\n        insolvency and/or disputes with regard to the designation or changes to the designation\n        of focal points.\n144.    The secretariat may engage the DNAs of the host Party or any other Parties participating\n        in the respective registered A6.4 project whenever issues arising from insolvency and/or\n        disputes over the designation of focal points are communicated to it. The secretariat may\n        provide information, subject to the confidentiality of such information, and/or administrative\n        assistance to the DNAs, upon request by the respective DNAs.\n145.    The secretariat, in its role as the mechanism registry administrator, may, after notifying\n        the focal points and the activity participants, temporarily put on hold the forwarding of\n        A6.4ERs for the registered A6.4 project for which the activity participants or the focal points\n        have communicated a case of insolvency and/or a dispute in relation to the MoC\n\n\n\n\n                                                  29 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        statement, pending resolution of the issues resulting from insolvency or resolution of the\n        disputes.\n146.    The secretariat shall display, subject to the confidentiality, indicative information related to\n        the notifications to the secretariat of issues arising from insolvency and/or of disputes on\n        the respective registered A6.4 project view page on the UNFCCC website, only in cases\n        where the forwarding of A6.4ERs has been temporarily put on hold pending the resolution\n        of the issues, in accordance with paragraph 145 above.\n\n6.3.3. Changes of focal points\n147.    Activity participants of a registered A6.4 project may change the designation of any focal\n        points for any reason and at any time by submitting a new MoC statement duly signed by\n        all activity participants, either through:\n        (a)     The focal points for scope of authority (b); or\n        (b)     Any of the activity participants, in cases of changes made to the MoC statement\n                excluding its annexes.\n148.    For changing the designation of focal points in accordance with paragraph 147 above, the\n        submission shall be made as follows:\n        (a)     A new MoC statement for changes related to designation of focal points, with the\n                exception of changes affecting only contact details and authorized signatories;\n        (b)     Annex 2 to the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication statement\n                form”, for changes related only to contact details and authorized signatories.\n149.    When a focal point who is not an activity participant is added to represent the activity\n        participants for any or all scopes of authority, the new MoC statement referred to in\n        paragraph 148(a) above shall be supported by written evidence of:\n        (a)     The new focal point’s corporate identity, if applicable and\n        (b)     The personal identity and employment status of the new focal point’s authorized\n                signatory(ies), including specimen signature(s).\n150.    The legal representative of a focal point for scope of authority (b) may submit a new\n        annex 2 to the MoC statement if the authorized signatory(ies) of the focal point concerned\n        is(are) no longer available.\n151.    Any focal point of a registered A6.4 project may request voluntary withdrawal from its role\n        as a focal point. Such a request shall cover all scopes of authority assumed by the focal\n        point. The voluntary withdrawal process shall follow the following steps:\n        (a)     The withdrawing focal point shall, directly or through the focal point for scope (b),\n                submit a withdrawal request to the secretariat including:\n                (i)    Annex 3 of the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication\n                       statement form”;\n                (ii)   Evidence of the written communication, sent by the withdrawing focal point\n                       to all other focal points and all activity participants, indicating its intention to\n                       withdraw from its role as a focal point, and inviting the designation of a new\n\n\n\n                                                  30 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                       focal point for the scope(s) of authority from which the focal point is\n                       withdrawing. Such written communications shall be made at least 30 days\n                       prior to the submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.\n        (b)     The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if found\n                complete, approve the withdrawal of the focal point. In doing so, the secretariat\n                may request clarification from the withdrawing focal point, or may contact any of\n                the other focal points or the activity participants to request additional clarifications;\n        (c)     Upon approval of the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat shall publish the\n                annex 3 of the MoC statement on the UNFCCC website. Additionally the secretariat\n                shall communicate the approval of the withdrawal of the focal point and its\n                implications on the MoC to all remaining focal points and activity participants of the\n                project;\n        (d)     The approved withdrawal of focal point shall have no effect on other focal points,\n                except in cases where the withdrawn focal point was part of joint or shared focal\n                point roles. In such cases, the remaining focal points shall continue to act in a sole,\n                shared or joint focal point role, as appropriate. If no focal point remains for a\n                specific scope of authority after the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat\n                shall notify the withdrawal to the remaining focal points for other scopes of\n                authority, or to all activity participants if no focal point remains. The activity\n                participants shall promptly designate a new focal point for any scope of authority\n                for which no focal point remains in accordance with the provisions of this section,\n                to enable further engagement with the Supervisory Body and the secretariat.\n\n6.3.4. Changes of activity participants\n152.    If the activity participants of a registered A6.4 project change after the registration of the\n        project, the focal points for scope of authority (b) shall submit annex 2 of the MoC\n        statement for each of the following changes:\n        (a)     Addition of an activity participant;\n        (b)     Changes related to entity names or legal status;\n        (c)     Withdrawal of an activity participant. If an activity participant has ceased operations\n                and is unable to sign annex 2 of the MoC statement, the submission shall be\n                accompanied by evidence of the cessation;\n        (d)     Changes related only to contact details and authorized signatories;\n        (e)     Addition or change of the end date of participation of an activity participant of the\n                project.\n153.    For the changes listed to in paragraph 152(a) and (b) above, the secretariat shall notify\n        the DNA of the host Party or any other relevant Party participating in the A6.4 project of\n        the requested change through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website referred\n        to in paragraph 22 above, and request them to respond whether to approve the change.\n154.    An activity participant added to a registered A6.4 project shall accept the existing MoC\n        statement, or the new MoC statement if submitted simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n155.    If persistent efforts to contact an activity participant have failed, the focal points for scope\n        of authority (b) may request the administrative withdrawal of the activity participant,\n        provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the host Party’s DNA remains.\n        The administrative withdrawal shall follow the following steps:\n        (a)     The focal points for scope (b) shall submit:\n                (i)    Annex 2 of the MoC statement, withdrawing the non-contactable activity\n                       participant;\n                (ii)   Evidence of written communication to the non-contactable activity participant\n                       stating the intention to request administrative withdrawal, including the copy\n                       of the communication sent to the DNA that authorized the activity participants\n                       to participate in the project, that has been sent at least 15 days prior to the\n                       submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.\n        (b)     The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if found\n                complete, send an e-mail to the non-contactable activity participant, with a copy to\n                the authorizing DNA, to respond within 30 days, asking whether the activity\n                participant objects to the administrative withdrawal. The secretariat may also use\n                other communication channels to establish contact with the non-contactable\n                activity participant;\n        (c)     If neither the non-contactable activity participant nor the authorizing DNA object to\n                proceeding with the administrative withdrawal within 30 days of the electronic\n                communication made in accordance with subparagraph (b) above, the secretariat\n                shall mark the non-contactable activity participant as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC\n                website;\n        (d)     If the non-contactable activity participant or the authorizing DNA objects to the\n                administrative withdrawal within the 30-day period mentioned in subparagraph (b)\n                above, the secretariat shall reject the request for withdrawal and may advise the\n                focal point for scope (b) on further actions;\n        (e)     Activity participants whose participation in the project has been administratively\n                withdrawn may request to be included as activity participants of the same project\n                any time thereafter in accordance with 152(a) above.\n156.

If the DOE requests the withdrawal after the publication of the\n        request for issuance in accordance with paragraph 191 above, the request for issuance\n        shall be marked as “withdrawn”. The same or a different DOE may resubmit the request\n        for issuance at any time.\n230.    If activity participants wish to change the monitoring period covered by the monitoring\n        report corresponding to the withdrawn request for issuance, and if the final date of the\n        changed monitoring period is after when the DOE conducted an on-site inspection, the\n        same or different DOE shall undertake an additional on-site inspection, or determine if an\n        on-site inspection is necessary to duly perform its verification by following the applicable\n        provisions of the validation and verification standard. Following the verification, the DOE\n        may submit request for issuance for the changed monitoring period as a new submission.\n\n10. Renewal of crediting period\n10.1. General requirements\n231.    If the host Party has provided an approval of renewal of the crediting period of the project\n        at the time of its registration in accordance with paragraph 24(b) above, crediting period\n        of the project may be renewed in accordance with this section.\n232.    Renewal of the crediting period does not require a new approval from the host Party and\n        new authorization of activity participants from the host Party or other participating Parties.\n233.    The new crediting period shall start on the day immediately after the expiration of the\n        current crediting period irrespective of the date when the renewal of the crediting period is\n        approved by the Supervisory Body.\n234.    If the date when the renewal of the crediting period is approved by the Supervisory Body\n        is after the expiration of the current crediting period, and due to this delay or for any other\n        reasons, the monitoring temporarily does not comply with the monitoring plan in the\n        updated PDD approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall request\n        approval of a temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan in accordance with\n        the process for approval of post-registration changes outlined in section 6 above.\n\n10.2.

If activity participants plan to make or have made, a post-registration change to the project\n        design effective from the start date of the new crediting period, they shall clearly indicate\n\n\n\n                                                  44 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        the post-registration change in the new version of the PDD, distinguishing the change from\n        other update of information solely related to the renewal of the crediting period.\n237.    If a post-registration change becomes effective either before or after the renewal of the\n        crediting period, it shall not be included in a request for renewal of the crediting period.\n        Instead, the post-registration change shall be submitted for the Supervisory Body approval\n        separately in accordance with section 6 above before or after the submission of the\n        request for renewal of the crediting period, respectively.\n\n10.2.2. Validation of updated project design document\n238.    Activity participants shall submit the new version of the PDD to any DOE accredited in the\n        relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participants to perform the\n        validation for renewal of the crediting period.\n239.    The DOE shall validate that the updated project design complies with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n        and requirements based on the information provided in the new version of the PDD and\n        any supporting documentation it has received from the activity participants and any further\n        information obtained during the validation activity. The DOE shall prepare a validation\n        report, in accordance with the validation and verification standard, using the “Validation\n        report form for renewal of the crediting period for projects”.\n240.    For the purpose of potential selection of the validation activity for performance assessment\n        of the DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”, the DOE shall\n        notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the\n        scheduled site inspection for the A6.4 project, which is to be conducted in accordance with\n        the validation and verification standard, no later than four weeks prior to the inspection.\n\n10.2.3. Submission of request for renewal\n241.    The DOE shall submit a request for renewal of the crediting period to the secretariat, after\n        validating that the project design updated for renewal of the crediting period and described\n        in the new version of the PDD meets all applicable requirements for renewal of the\n        crediting period in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism\n        rules and requirements. The request for renewal shall be submitted through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website, including the reference to the notification of the timing\n        of the site inspection made in accordance with paragraph 240 above, along with the\n        following attachments:\n        (a)     The new version of the PDD prepared by the activity participants in accordance\n                with paragraph 235 above and validated by the DOE in accordance with\n                paragraph 239 above;\n        (b)     The validation report prepared by the DOE in accordance with paragraph 239\n                above.\n242.    A request for renewal of the crediting period shall be submitted no earlier than 270 days\n        prior to, but no later than one year after, the expiration of the crediting period. If a\n        submission was made after this deadline, the crediting period of the project may no longer\n        be renewed. The secretariat shall send a reminder to the activity participants 270 days\n        prior to the expiry of the crediting period, including information on the consequence of\n        missing the deadline.\n\n\n\n                                                  45 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n243.

The request for deregistration shall be deemed\n        received by the Supervisory Body.\n255.    The secretariat shall promptly inform the Supervisory Body of the receipt of the request\n        for deregistration and mark the A6.4 project as “deregistered’’ on the UNFCCC website.\n256.    The secretariat shall inform the host Party and other participating Parties of the\n        deregistration of the A6.4 project.\n\n11.3. Effects of deregistration\n257.    The effective date of deregistration shall be the date when the secretariat received a\n        complete submission of the request for deregistration.\n258.    A DOE may submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs in accordance with section 9.1.1\n        above for the deregistered A6.4 project for the period prior to the effective date of\n        deregistration.\n259.    A DOE shall not make any request for issuance that covers the monitoring period including\n        any date that is on or after the effective date of deregistration. The mechanism registry\n        administrator shall not issue A6.4ERs for the deregistered A6.4 project for the period from\n        the effective date of deregistration.\n260.    An A6.4 project that has been deregistered may not be reregistered under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism or included as a component project activity in a registered A6.4 programme\n        of activities.\n261.    The registration fee shall not be reimbursed for a deregistered A6.4 project.\n\n\n\n                                                  47 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n11.4. Administration period\n262.    During the period from the effective date of deregistration of an A6.4 project until the date\n        that is three calendar years later:\n        (a)     The secretariat shall communicate with the activity participants, the host Party and\n                other participating Parties in order to assist them to settle outstanding matters in\n                relation to the deregistered A6.4 project, including the completion of all issuance\n                requests and forwarding requests in respect of GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals achieved prior to the effective date of deregistration, and such other\n                steps as are necessary to ensure the completion of outstanding matters in relation\n                to the deregistered A6.4 project;\n        (b)     Each activity participant may, after the effective date of deregistration, where\n                necessary, be treated as if it were still an activity participant by the Supervisory\n                Body and the secretariat for the purposes of the activity standard and this\n                procedure in order to allow the secretariat to process instructions relating to GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved prior to the effective date of\n                deregistration from such activity participant in relation to the deregistered A6.4\n                project.\n\n12. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorization of\n    activity participant\n12.1. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant\n\n12.1.1. Submission of withdrawal notification\n263.    The host Party of a proposed or registered A6.4 project may, through its DNA, submit a\n        notification to the secretariat to withdraw the approval of the project or the authorization of\n        any of the activity participants made in accordance with paragraphs 23‒24 above any time\n        through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the following\n        information:\n        (a)     The project title and its unique UNFCCC reference number;\n        (b)     The type of withdrawal (either withdrawal of approval of project or withdrawal of\n                authorization of activity participants);\n        (c)     The names of activity participants to whom the withdrawal of authorization applies\n                (if the withdrawal only relates to the authorization of activity participants);\n        (d)     The effective date of the withdrawal, which shall be at least 60 days after the date\n                of the notification of the withdrawal unless the host Party specifies an earlier date\n                with justification;\n        (e)     The reason(s) for the withdrawal.\n264.    Other participating Parties may withdraw the authorization of activity participants made in\n        accordance with paragraph 26 above, through their DNAs, any time through the dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the information listed in paragraph 263(a)−(e)\n        above.\n\n\n\n                                                  48 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n265.    Upon receipt of the withdrawal notification, the secretariat shall promptly inform the\n        affected activity participants of the notification and check whether the information provided\n        is complete. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall request the DNAs of the Parties\n        submitting the withdrawal to provide the missing information.\n266.    The secretariat shall publish the withdrawal of the approval of the project and/or the\n        authorization of activity participants on the UNFCCC website on the effective date of the\n        withdrawal.\n267.    If the host Party withdraws the approval of the project:\n        (a)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is before the DOE submits a request for\n                registration of the project in accordance with paragraph 67 above, such request\n                may not be submitted;\n        (b)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the DOE has submitted of a request\n                for registration but before the final decision of the Supervisory Body on the request,\n                the request shall not be processed;\n        (c)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the final decision of the Supervisory\n                Body to register the project, the provisions outlined in paragraph 268 below shall\n                apply.\n\n12.1.2. Impact of withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant\n268.    For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party withdrew its approval, requests for\n        issuance of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project before\n        to the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline specified in\n        paragraph 177 above. Consequently, the A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with\n        sections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover a monitoring\n        period from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the project.\n269.    For a registered A6.4 project from which the host Party or other participating Parties only\n        withdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the project may still be\n        submitted until the deadline specified in paragraph 177 above. Consequently, the\n        A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity\n        participant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance\n        and distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn\n        shall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the project for the monitoring\n        period prior to the date of the withdrawal of the authorization.\n\n13. Appeals and grievances\n270.    Stakeholders, the activity participants, the host Party and other participating Parties,\n        through their DNAs, may appeal decisions of the Supervisory Body or request that a\n        grievance be addressed in accordance with paragraphs 89, 103, 198 and 214 above and\n        the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  49 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. Fee schedule\n\n1.     Background\n1.      This Appendix outlines the fee rates payable by the activity participants of a proposed or\n        registered Article 6, paragraph 4, mechanism projects (A6.4 projects). These fees are\n        intended to cover the administrative expenses for processing requests submitted at\n        various stage of the Article 6, paragraph 4, mechanism (the Article 6.4 mechanism) activity\n        cycle. This Appendix also details the rules of reimbursement of paid fees where requests\n        are withdrawn by the submitting designated operations entities (DOEs), concluded as\n        incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected by the Supervisory Body.\n2.      The fee types and rates are set based on the decisions made by the Conference of the\n        Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) relating to the\n        share of proceeds to cover administrative expenses as outlined in decision 3/CMA3,\n        annex, paragraphs 48, and chapter VII, as elaborated in decision 7/CMA.4, annex I,\n        chapter V.\n\n2.     General\n3.      In accordance with the relevant sections of this procedure, fees outlined in this\n        Appendix shall be paid at the time of submission of the respective requests. The initiation\n        of processing of a request shall be subject to the payment of the fee.\n4.      All fees referred to in this Appendix shall be waived for projects hosted in the least\n        developed countries and small island developing States.\n5.      The Supervisory Body may adjust and implement the fee structure and levels within the\n        boundary set by the CMA in its decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapter V, on the basis of the\n        guiding principles of balancing the income and the expenditure, enabling long-term sound\n        operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism, being fair to activity participants, ensuring\n        administrative efficiency and providing predictability to activity participants and the\n        Supervisory Body.\n\n3.     Registration fee\n6.      The fee for a request for registration of a proposed A6.4 project (the registration fee) shall\n        be fixed and tiered based on the estimated annual average greenhouse gas (GHG)\n        emission reductions or net GHG removals over the first crediting period, if it is renewable,\n        or over the entire crediting period, if it is fixed, as follows:\n        (a)     USD 1,500 for a project achieving annual average GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals over the (first) crediting period of up to 15,000 tonnes of carbon\n                dioxide equivalent (t CO2 eq);\n        (b)     USD 5,000 for a project achieving annual average GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals over the (first) crediting period of between 15,001 and 50,000 t CO2\n                eq;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     USD 10,000 for a project achieving annual average GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals over the (first) crediting period exceeding 50,000 t CO2 eq.\n7.      If the request for registration is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the\n        secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this procedure, the paid\n        registration fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage, or removed due to the withdrawal of host\n                Party approval;\n        (b)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 1,500 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the completeness check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for registration within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 77 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (c)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 5,000 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the substantive check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for registration within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 80 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (d)     No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the substantive\n                check stage or rejected by the Supervisory Body.\n\n4.     Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool consideration fee\n8.      The fee for consideration of a request for deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4\n        SD Tool shall be set at USD 1,500 per request.\n9.      If the request for deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool is withdrawn by\n        the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body,\n        the paid deviation fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following\n        manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage in accordance with this procedure;\n        (b)     No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage.\n\n5.     Post-registration change fee\n10.     The fee for a request for approval of post-registration change to a registered A6.4 project\n        (the post-registration change fee) shall be set at USD 1,500 per request.\n11.     If the post-registration change increases the scale of the project to bring the scale to a\n        higher tier of the registration fee, the difference between the paid registration fee\n        calculated in accordance with paragraph 6 above and the newly calculated fee shall be\n        paid in addition to the post-registration change fee. For any other post-registration\n        changes, any portion of the paid registration fee shall not be reimbursable.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  51 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n12.     If the request for approval of post-registration change is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded\n        as incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body, the paid post-\n        registration fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage in accordance with this procedure;\n        (b)     No reimbursement if the request is withdrawn by the DOE after the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage.\n\n6.     Issuance fee\n13.     The fee for a request for issuance of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs)\n        for a registered A6.4 project (the issuance fee) shall be a proportional levy to the amount\n        of A6.4ERs requested for issuance, set at USD 0.15 per A6.4ER requested for issuance.\n14.     If the request for issuance is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as incomplete by the\n        secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this procedure, the paid\n        issuance fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the following manner:\n        (a)     Reimbursement in full if the request is withdrawn by the DOE before the secretariat\n                starts the completeness check stage;\n        (b)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 1,500 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the completeness check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for issuance within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 187 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (c)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 5,000 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE or concluded as incomplete by the secretariat at the substantive check\n                stage, provided that the request is not resubmitted for issuance within the\n                timeframe referred to in paragraph 190 of the main part of this procedure;\n        (d)     Reimbursement of any amount above USD 10,000 if the request is withdrawn by\n                the DOE any time after the substantive check stage or rejected by the Supervisory\n                Body.\n15.     If, as a result of the substantive check by the secretariat or the review by the Supervisory\n        Body of the request for issuance, the quantity of A6.4ERs to be issued changed from that\n        in the initial request for issuance, the activity participants or the secretariat shall settle the\n        difference in the issuance fees if the difference is more than USD 300.\n\n7.     Renewal fee\n16.     The fee for a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project\n        (renewal fee) shall be at the same rate as the registration fee specified in paragraph 6\n        above, based on the scale of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals of the\n        project.\n17.     If the request for renewal of the crediting period is withdrawn by the DOE, concluded as\n        incomplete by the secretariat, or rejected the Supervisory Body in accordance with this\n        procedure, the paid renewal fee shall be reimbursed to the activity participants in the same\n        manner as referred to in paragraph 7 above.\n\n\n\n                                                  52 of 54\nA6.4-PROC-AC-002\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The CMA, at its sixth session, elaborated provisions of the RMPs relating to the\n          authorization of the use of Article 6, paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs) and\n          exemption from the share of proceeds for adaptation for least developed countries (LDCs)\n          and small island developing States (SIDS).4\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Tool: Article 6.4 sustainable\n          development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool) that provides means for\n          activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory requirements for\n          identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for assessing and\n          enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to sustainable development in line with\n          sustainable development objectives and priorities of the host Party and the sustainable\n          development goals.\n5.        The Supervisory Body, at its sixteenth meeting, adopted revisions to the “Standard: Article\n          6.4 activity standard for programme of activities” (AS-PoA) which, among other things,\n          included the relevant requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool. Additionally, the AS-PoA included\n          new provisions allowing activity participants to request a deviation through a DOE to the\n          Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for registration or request for issuance if\n          the DOE or the activity participants identify the presence of unavoidable negative impacts\n          that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be\n          remediated by consultation or mitigation.\n\n1.2.      Objectives\n6.        The objective of the “Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”\n          (hereinafter referred to as this procedure) is to set out all procedural steps and\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

If the design of the proposed A6.4 PoA has undergone changes after the publication of\n        the PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, the DOE shall determine whether these\n        changes are significant. If the changes are determined by the DOE to be significant, the\n        DOE shall request the activity participants to make a revised PoA-DD publicly available\n        for global stakeholder consultation. The DOE or the activity participant may seek guidance\n        from the Supervisory Body on whether a revised PoA-DD shall be published for global\n        stakeholder consultation by submitting such a request in accordance with the “Procedure:\n        Direct communication with stakeholders”.\n31.     The Supervisory Body shall expeditiously consider the case, through electronic means\n        where possible, and provide guidance to the DOE and/or the activity participants. In doing\n        so, the Supervisory Body shall consider the significance of the changes in terms of the\n        impact on the application of the applied methodologies, the other methodological\n        regulatory documents and local stakeholders.\n\n4.6.2. Modalities of communication statement\n32.     The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 PoA shall designate one or more focal point\n        entities (hereinafter referred to as focal points) to communicate on their behalf with the\n        Supervisory Body and the secretariat within the defined scopes of authority referred to in\n        paragraph 34(c) below. This information shall be included in the modalities of\n        communication (MoC) statement using the “Modalities of communication statement form”.\n\n\n                                                 13 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n33.     After submission of a request for registration of a proposed A6.4 PoA in accordance with\n        paragraph 43 below, all official communication between the activity participants and the\n        Supervisory Body or secretariat for the PoA shall be conducted in accordance with the\n        MoC statement with the exception of communications undertaken in accordance with\n        paragraphs 177 and 189(b) below.\n34.     The activity participants shall grant the focal points the authority to:\n        (a)     Communicate in relation to requests for forwarding of A6.4ERs to individual\n                accounts of the activity participants (scope (a)); and/or\n        (b)     Communicate in relation to changes to the MoC statement (scope (b)); and/or\n        (c)     Communicate on all other PoA-related matters not covered by (a) or (b) above\n                (scope (c)).\n35.     The activity participants may designate one or multiple entities for each scope of authority\n        in a sole or joint focal point role.11 The number of joint focal points for a PoA shall be limited\n        to five, or equal to the number of host Parties if greater than five.\n36.     The activity participants and the focal points may designate one primary authorized\n        signatory and one alternate authorized signatory. The authentication of either the primary\n        or alternate authorized signatory shall suffice for authenticating the activity participant’s or\n        focal point’s consent or instruction(s). If an entity serves as both an activity participant and\n        a focal point, the same signatory shall represent the entity in both roles.\n37.     The activity participants may voluntarily indicate in the MoC statement the end date of their\n        participation in the proposed A6.4 PoA. The secretariat shall monitor the end date of\n        participation and mark the activity participants as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website on\n        the day after the end date, provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the\n        host Party of the PoA remains. The activity participants whose participation in the PoA has\n        ended may request to be re-included as an activity participant in the same PoA at any time\n        thereafter in accordance with paragraph 194(a) below.\n38.     When conducting the completeness check of the request for registration in accordance\n        with paragraphs 51−53 below, the secretariat shall consider the contact details of the\n        activity participants and their representatives included in the MoC statement to be the valid\n        contact details whenever such details differ from the details included in the PoA-DD of the\n        proposed A6.4 PoA.\n39.     The secretariat shall publish non-confidential information included in the MoC statement,\n        on the respective A6.4 PoA web page of the UNFCCC website, following registration of\n        the PoA under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n4.6.3. Validation of the programme of activities design document\n40.     The activity participants shall submit the PoA-DD published for the global stakeholder\n        consultation or any later version of the PoA-DD, along with the MoC statement, a\n        declaration that the development, implementation and operation of the proposed A6.4 PoA\n        do not involve any illegal activities and any supporting documentation to a DOE accredited\n\n\n\n11 Joint focal point role requires consent from all focal point entities to communicate with the Supervisory\n\n  Body or the secretariat.\n\n\n                                                 14 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participants to perform\n        validation of the PoA for registration.\n41.     The DOE shall perform validation of whether the proposed A6.4 PoA complies with the\n        relevant requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4\n        mechanism rules and requirements, based on the information provided in the PoA-DD,\n        the MoC statement, any supporting documentation it has received from the activity\n        participants and any further information obtained during the validation activity. The DOE\n        shall prepare a validation report, in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and\n        verification standard for programmes of activities” (hereinafter referred to as the validation\n        and verification standard), using the “Validation report form for article 6.4 programmes of\n        activities”.\n42.     For the purpose of potential selection of the validation activity for performance assessment\n        of the DOE in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”, the DOE shall\n        notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the\n        scheduled site inspection for the proposed A6.4 PoA, which is to be conducted in\n        accordance with the validation and verification standard, no later than four weeks prior to\n        the inspection.\n\n5.

The DOE shall, after validating that the proposed A6.4 PoA described in the PoA-DD\n        meets all relevant requirements for registration in the activity standard and any other\n        applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, submit a request for registration\n        of the PoA to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n        including reference to the prior consideration notification of the PoA published in\n        accordance with paragraph 18 above and the notification of the timing of the site\n        inspection made in accordance with paragraph 42 above, along with the following\n        attachments:\n        (a)     The PoA-DD and any supporting documentation of the proposed A6.4 PoA\n                prepared by the activity participants in accordance with paragraph 29 above and\n                validated by the DOE in accordance with paragraph 41 above;\n        (b)     The validation report prepared by the DOE in accordance with paragraph 41\n                above;\n        (c)     The MoC statement prepared by the activity participants in accordance with\n                section 4.6.2 above;\n        (d)     A declaration that the development, implementation, and operation of the proposed\n                A6.4 PoA do not involve any illegal activities, including money laundering, tax\n                evasion, fraud, bribery, and criminal activities.\n44.     A request for registration of a proposed A6.4 PoA may be submitted at any time after the\n        approval of the PoA provided by the host Party to the Supervisory Body in accordance\n        with paragraph 23(a) above has been published on the UNFCCC website in accordance\n        with paragraph 27 above but within one year of publication of the approval.\n\n\n\n                                                 15 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n45.     The secretariat shall issue a statement of the registration fee due, or a confirmation that\n        no registration fee is due in accordance with the provisions on the registration fee detailed\n        in Appendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE.\n46.     The DOE shall communicate the registration fee due, or a confirmation that no registration\n        fee is due, to the activity participants.\n47.     The activity participants shall pay the registration fee by bank transfer, quoting the unique\n        reference number referred to in paragraph 18 above, within one year of the issuance to\n        the DOE of the statement of the registration fee due.\n48.     The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website. If the proposed A6.4 PoA applies:\n        (a)     A methodology or methodological tool that has been revised, withdrawn or\n                suspended by the Supervisory Body, the proof of payment must be uploaded within\n                20 days, or the payment must be received by the secretariat within 40 days of the\n                end of the grace period for revision or the date of withdrawal or suspension, as\n                defined in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of\n                methodologies and methodological tools”; and/or\n        (b)     A standardized baseline that has been revised, suspended or has expired, the\n                proof of payment must be uploaded within 20 days, or the payment must be\n                received by the secretariat within 40 days of the end of the grace period for revision\n                or the date of suspension or expiry, as defined in the “Procedure: Development,\n                revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.\n49.     If the secretariat does not receive the deposit of the registration fee by the deadline\n        referred to in paragraph 47 above or paragraph 48 above, as applicable, the request for\n        registration shall be deemed withdrawn. The same or a different DOE may submit a new\n        request for registration of the same proposed A6.4 PoA anytime thereafter, following the\n        applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of the new\n        submission. In this case, the original prior consideration notification published in\n        accordance with paragraph 18 above remains valid for the new request for registration.\n\n5.1.2. Processing of request for registration\n50.     The secretariat shall maintain on the UNFCCC website a publicly available list of all\n        submitted requests for registration for which the applicable registration fee has been\n        received by the secretariat, or for which no registration fee is due. The secretariat shall\n        make publicly available the schedule and status of processing of each request for\n        registration. The secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of the\n        requests for registration in accordance with its operational plans, which\n        incorporate monthly quotas, any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body.\n51.     The secretariat shall commence the completeness check stage in accordance with the\n        established schedule. Upon commencement of the completeness check stage, the\n        secretariat shall, subject to guidance from the Supervisory Body, conduct within\n        seven days a completeness check to determine whether the request for registration\n        submission is complete in accordance with the completeness check checklist for requests\n        for registration.\n52.     If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        consistency issues in the submission, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the\n\n\n                                                 16 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        activity participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE\n        shall submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of\n        the request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by\n        this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request for registration submission is\n        incomplete, unless the DOE provides a justification, by this deadline, for not being able to\n        submit the requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall\n        be extended accordingly.\n53.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        completeness check stage. If the request for registration submission does not meet the\n        requirements of the completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the\n        underlying reasons to the activity participants and the DOE and make this information\n        publicly available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit the\n        request for registration with revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for\n        registration is made within 28 days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-\n        commence the completeness check; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a\n        new submission of a request for registration.\n54.     Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject\n        to guidance from the Supervisory Body, conduct a substantive check within 21 days in\n        accordance with the substantive check checklist for requests for registration.\n55.     If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or\n        missing basic information, it shall request the DOE, copying the activity participants, to\n        submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the\n        requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the request. If the\n        DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the\n        secretariat shall conclude that the request for registration submission is incomplete, unless\n        the DOE provides a justification, by this deadline, for not being able to submit the\n        requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be\n        extended accordingly.\n56.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        substantive check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of the\n        substantive check, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is\n        incomplete and communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants and the\n        DOE and make this information publicly available on the UNFCCC website. In this case,\n        the DOE may resubmit the request for registration with revised documentation. If the\n        resubmission of the request for registration is made within 28 days of the notification, the\n        secretariat shall promptly re-commence the substantive check; otherwise, the\n        resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for registration.\n57.     Upon a positive conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall publish\n        the request for registration on the UNFCCC website and it shall be deemed received by\n        the Supervisory Body for consideration.\n58.     For resubmission of a request for registration after the completeness check or the\n        substantive check in accordance with paragraphs 53 above or 56 above, respectively, the\n        proposed A6.4 PoA may apply the same version of the methodology, methodological tool\n        and/or standardized baseline applied in the initial submission within 90 days of the initial\n        notification of the negative conclusion of the completeness check or substantive check,\n        even if the version of any of the methodology, methodological tool or standardized\n        baseline applied is no longer valid. After this 90-day period, all resubmissions shall apply\n\n\n\n                                                 17 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        the version of the methodology, methodological tool and/or standardized baseline valid for\n        a new request for registration.\n59.     The secretariat shall notify the activity participants, the DNAs of the host Party and other\n        participating Parties, and the DOE:\n        (a)     That the Supervisory Body has received the request for registration for its\n                consideration;\n        (b)     That the secretariat has published the request for registration on the UNFCCC\n                website; and\n        (c)     Of the deadline for requesting a review of the request for registration, as referred\n                to in paragraph 61 below.\n60.     The secretariat shall, subject to guidance from the Supervisory Body, prepare and send\n        the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for registration within 14 days of the\n        date of the request publication.\n\n5.1.3. Requesting review of the request for registration\n61.

If a host Party or other participating\n        Party wishes to request a review, its DNA shall submit the request through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website. If a member or an alternate member of the Supervisory\n        Body wishes to request a review, they shall submit the request through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website.\n62.     The secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of a request for review and promptly notify the\n        Supervisory Body. A request for review shall not be recognized if it is received after 24:00\n        (Central European Time/Central European Summer Time) on the last day of the 28-day\n        period following the publication of the request for registration.\n63.     A request for review shall provide, inter alia, the reasons for the requested review, based\n        on the activity standard, the validation and verification standard or any other applicable\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements.\n\n5.1.4. Finalizing the request for registration if no request for review was received\n64.     If the secretariat does not receive a request for review in accordance with the modalities\n        described in section 5.1.3 above, the request for registration shall be deemed approved\n        by the Supervisory Body.\n65.     Stakeholders who were eligible to participate in the local or subnational stakeholder\n        consultation of any of the included CPs in accordance with the activity standard, activity\n        participants, host Party or other participating Parties (hereinafter referred to as eligible\n        stakeholders, activity participants or Parties) may, in accordance with the appeal and\n        grievance procedure,12 appeal the decision of the Supervisory Body to approve the\n        registration within 28 days of the request having been deemed approved.

The expert review team shall submit its assessment report to the Supervisory Body\n        through the secretariat.\n76.     The secretariat shall make the assessment report available to the Supervisory Body,\n        together with any responses from the activity participants and the DOE, and any revision\n        made to the PoA-DD, validation report and/or other relevant documentation.\n\n5.2.3. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n77.     At its meeting, the Supervisory Body shall, taking into account the assessment report\n        prepared by the expert review team and the summary note prepared by the secretariat,\n        decide to either:\n        (a)     Register the proposed A6.4 PoA under the Article 6.4 mechanism; or\n        (b)     Reject the request for registration.\n78.     Eligible stakeholders, activity participants and Parties may, in accordance with the appeal\n        and grievance procedure, appeal the decision of the Supervisory Body within 28 days of\n        the decision. If no appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, activity participant or Party\n        within this time frame, the process contained in section 5.2.4 below shall be followed. If\n        an appeal is filed by an eligible stakeholder, activity participant or Party within this time\n        frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed.\n\n5.2.4. Finalization and implementation of ruling\n79.     If the Supervisory Body’s final decision made in accordance with paragraph 77 above is\n        to register the proposed A6.4 PoA under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the secretariat shall\n        register it as an A6.4 PoA on the first working day following the final decision and inform\n        the activity participants, the DOE, the host Party and any other participating Party about\n        the decision.\n\n\n                                                 20 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n80.     The start date of the first PoA period shall be the date indicated in the PoA-DD as approved\n        by the host Party in accordance with section 4.4 above.\n81.     If the Supervisory Body’s final decision made in accordance with paragraph 77 above is\n        to reject the request for registration, the secretariat shall update the information on the\n        UNFCCC website accordingly on the first working day following the final decision and\n        inform the activity participants, the DOE, the host Party and any other participating Party\n        about the decision. Additionally, within 21 days of the final decision, the secretariat shall\n        provide the Chair of the Supervisory Body with an information note containing a proposed\n        ruling incorporating the final decision.\n82.     The proposed ruling shall contain an explanation of the reasons and rationale for the final\n        decision of rejection, including, but not limited to:\n        (a)     The facts and any interpretation of those facts that formed the basis of the\n                proposed ruling;\n        (b)     The Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements applied to the facts;\n        (c)     The interpretation of the Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements as applied\n                to the facts.\n83.     Once approved by the Chair of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall immediately\n        make the proposed ruling available to the Supervisory Body. The proposed ruling shall\n        become the final ruling of the Supervisory Body 10 days after it was made available to the\n        Supervisory Body, unless a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body objects\n        to it.\n84.     An objection by a member or an alternate member of the Supervisory Body to the\n        proposed ruling shall be made by notifying the secretariat in writing of the for the objection.\n        The secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the\n        Supervisory Body.\n85.     If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the proposed ruling more than 14 days\n        prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n        next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n        subsequent Supervisory Body meeting.\n86.     At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the case is placed on the agenda, the\n        Supervisory Body shall finalize the ruling.\n87.     The secretariat shall publish a ruling note on the UNFCCC website no later than three\n        days after the ruling is finalized.\n88.     If the request for registration is rejected by the Supervisory Body, any DOE may resubmit\n        the request for registration with revised documentation, addressing the issues that\n        constitute the reason for the rejection by the Supervisory Body. Upon submission of the\n        revised documentation, the request shall be treated as a new submission of a request for\n        registration.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 21 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n5.3.

Processing of request for withdrawal\n90.     Upon receipt of the request for withdrawal of a request for registration, the secretariat shall\n        check the information provided to it as soon as possible. If the request is complete, the\n        secretariat shall reimburse the registration fee, if applicable, in accordance with Appendix\n        1 and take the following actions:\n        (a)     If the DOE requests the withdrawal prior to the publication of the request for\n                registration made in accordance with paragraph 57 above, the secretariat shall not\n                mark the proposed A6.4 PoA as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website;\n        (b)     If the DOE requests the withdrawal after the publication of the request for\n                registration made in accordance with paragraph 57 above, the secretariat shall\n                mark the proposed A6.4 PoA as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.      Post-registration activities\n6.1.    Notification of intention to include component projects in registered\n        programme of activities\n91.     The activity participants of a proposed CP shall notify the secretariat of their intention to\n        include the CP in a registered A6.4 PoA under the Article 6.4 mechanism or in a PoA\n        planned to be registered in the future14 (hereinafter referred to as CP inclusion notification).\n        The CP inclusion notification shall be submitted through a dedicated interface on the\n        UNFCCC website. If the CP has already started as per the definition of the “start date” of\n        a CP in the activity standard, the CP inclusion notification shall be submitted within 180\n        days after the publication of the respective PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation.\n        The CP inclusion notification shall include a summary of the CP, which shall contain, at\n        minimum:\n        (a)     The title of the registered or proposed A6.4 PoA provided that the proposed PoA\n                has initiated the global stakeholder consultation process, in which the CP is\n                intended to be included;\n        (b)     The title of the CP;\n        (c)     The names of the activity participants;\n\n\n\n13 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously.\n\n14 The PoA-DD must have at least been published for global stakeholder consultation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (d)     The precise geographic location of the CP;\n        (e)     A brief description of the technologies or measures to be deployed by the CP;\n        (f)     The methodology to be applied by the specific A6.4 CP (if known);\n        (g)     The actual or planned start date of the CP;\n        (h)     The type (fixed or renewable), planned start date and duration of the crediting\n                period of the CP;\n        (i)     The approximate amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                expected to be achieved by the CP in each year of the crediting period.\n92.     Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 91 above, if the start date of a proposed CP is\n        after 31 December 2020, prior to the date of entry into force of version 01.0 of this\n        procedure and after the start date of the first PoA period, the activity participants shall, if\n        they wish to seek inclusion of the CP in an A6.4 PoA already registered or planned to be\n        registered in the future, submit a CP inclusion notification through the dedicated interface\n        on the UNFCCC website referred to in paragraph 91 above within 180 days after the\n        publication of the respective PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation.\n93.     Once the secretariat confirms that the required information has been duly provided, it shall\n        promptly assign a unique reference number to the CP linked to the registered or planned\n        to be registered A6.4 PoA and publish the CP inclusion notification on the UNFCCC\n        website.\n94.     Upon publication of the CP inclusion notification on the UNFCCC website, the secretariat\n        shall inform the host Party of the receipt of the notification.\n\n6.2.    Preparation, validation, and inclusion of a component project\n\n6.2.1. Preparation of the component project design document\n95.     To include a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA, activity participants shall submit a completed\n        component project design document (CP-DD) using the “Component project design\n        document form”. The submission of the CP-DD shall be made to any DOE accredited in\n        the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participant. Prior to\n        submission, activity participants shall ensure that the proposed CP complies with the\n        corresponding generic CP-DD in the latest version of the registered PoA-DD, including the\n        eligibility criteria for the inclusion of CPs in the PoA, and the relevant requirements outlined\n        in the activity standard and relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements. The\n        activity participants may submit multiple CP-DDs simultaneously.\n96.     If unavoidable negative impacts are identified by activity participants that exceed the\n        environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by\n        consultation or mitigation, activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE\n        as per the process for requesting a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD\n        Tool described in section 6.2.3 below.\n\n6.2.2. Validation of component project design document\n97.     The DOE shall validate whether the project design complies with the relevant requirements\n        in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and\n        requirements based on the information provided in the CP-DD and any supporting\n\n\n                                                 23 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        documentation it has received from the activity participants as well as further information\n        obtained during the validation activity. The DOE shall prepare a validation report, in\n        accordance with the validation and verification standard, using the “Validation report form\n        for inclusion of CPs”.\n98.     If the DOE or activity participants identify that the sum of the estimated annual GHG\n        emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the proposed CP\n        combined with the cumulative annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals expected to be achieved by all CPs that have already been included in the PoA\n        exceeds the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n        approved by the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above, the CP shall not be included in\n        the PoA. However, the CPs may be included in the PoA if a post-registration change to\n        the PoA is approved by the Supervisory Body, as per paragraph 142(a)(iii) below, allowing\n        for an increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals expected to be achieved by the CPs to be included.\n\n6.2.3. Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool\n\n6.2.3.1.        Submission of a request for deviation\n99.     The DOE may submit a deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool to the\n        secretariat and seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a\n        deviation. Such deviation may be submitted when the activity participants prior to\n        validation or the DOE during validation have identified the presence of unavoidable\n        impacts that exceed the environmental and social safeguard elements and criteria, and\n        that cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation.\n100.    To seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of the deviation, the\n        DOE shall submit a “Deviation from elements and criteria of the A6.4 SD Tool request\n        form” and additional documentation through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n        website. In the submission, the DOE shall provide:\n        (a)     A clear and precise assessment of the case, based on evidence provided by the\n                activity participant as per the activity standard, including input from local\n                stakeholders if any;\n        (b)     A description of the impact of the deviation on social, environmental and\n                sustainable development impacts from the proposed project;\n        (c)     A draft CP-DD with a completed section A: Project description and Section E:\n                Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts\n                including its Appendices 6 (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                assessment form), 7 (A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form)\n                and/or 8 (A6.4 Sustainable development impact form).\n\n6.2.3.2.        Processing of request for deviation\n101.    The secretariat shall issue a statement of the deviation consideration fee due, or\n        confirmation that no fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions contained in\n        Appendix 1, and shall communicate this to the DOE.\n102.    The DOE shall communicate to the activity participants the deviation consideration fee\n        due, or a confirmation that no fee is due.\n\n\n\n                                                 24 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n103.    The activity participants shall pay the deviation consideration fee by bank transfer, quoting\n        the unique CP reference number referred to in paragraph 93 above, within 30 days of the\n        issuance to the DOE of the statement of the deviation consideration fee due.\n104.    The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website.\n105.    If the secretariat does not receive the deviation consideration fee by the 30-day deadline\n        referred to in paragraph 103 above, the request for deviation shall be deemed withdrawn.\n        The DOE may submit a new request for deviation of the same CP anytime thereafter,\n        following the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of\n        the new submission.\n106.    The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted requests for deviation\n        on the UNFCCC website for which the applicable fee has been received by the secretariat\n        or for which no fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly available the schedule of\n        processing the requests for deviation, including the expected date of commencement. The\n        secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of the requests for\n        deviation in accordance with the secretariat’s operational plans – that is, monthly quotas\n        – which shall also incorporate any relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body.\n107.    The secretariat shall commence the processing of the request for deviation in accordance\n        with the schedule. The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check within seven days\n        to determine whether the request submission is complete in accordance with\n        paragraph 100 above.\n108.    If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        inconsistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE, by email, to submit revised\n        documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall submit the requested\n        documents and/or information within two days of receipt of the request. If the DOE does\n        not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat\n        shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless the DOE provides a\n        justification by this deadline for not being able to submit the requested documents and/or\n        information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be extended accordingly.\n109.    The secretariat shall notify the DOE of the conclusion of the completeness check. If the\n        request submission is found incomplete, the secretariat shall also communicate the\n        underlying reasons to the DOE and make them publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n        In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for deviation with revised documentation.\n        If the resubmission of the request for deviation is made within 28 days of the notification,\n        the secretariat shall promptly commence the completeness check again; otherwise the\n        resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for deviation.\n110.    Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall publish the\n        request for deviation on the UNFCCC website, and the request for deviation shall be\n        deemed received by the Supervisory Body for consideration.\n111.    Within 14 days of the date of publication of the request for deviation, the secretariat shall\n        prepare and send to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for deviation\n        including a recommendation on the course of action, or with a notification that the case\n        will be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting.\n112.    If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require\n        clarifications from the DOE, it shall request the DOE to submit revised documents and/or\n\n\n                                                 25 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        information to clarify the issues within 14 days of receipt of the request. If the DOE submits\n        the requested documents and/or information within the deadline, the secretariat,\n        notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 111 above, shall promptly finalize the\n        summary note and send it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of the\n        requested documents and/or information from the DOE. If the DOE does not submit the\n        requested documents and/or information by the deadline, the secretariat shall not process\n        the request submission any further.\n113.    If the request submission is removed from processing in accordance with paragraph 112\n        above, the DOE may request the secretariat, by email through a dedicated email address,\n        to make a telephone call or an internet-based call to the DOE to provide clarifications on\n        the issues identified if they are not clear enough to them. Only one such request shall be\n        allowed per request for deviation. In this case, the DOE shall provide the contact details\n        of the person to be called and the preferred time slots. The secretariat shall fix an\n        appointment for the call within three days of receipt of the request. The secretariat shall\n        record the call.\n114.    If the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note, identifies issues that require\n        inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts, it shall send the case to an\n        appropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide inputs within seven days of receipt\n        of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall, notwithstanding the provisions in\n        paragraphs 111 and 112 above, finalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory\n        Body within 14 days of receipt of the inputs from the expert.\n115.    If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the\n        course of action referred to in paragraph 111 above within 14 days of receipt of the\n        summary note, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision\n        adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n116.    An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n        of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving the reasons in writing. The\n        secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the\n        Supervisory Body.\n117.    If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the secretariat’s recommendation on the\n        course of action more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case\n        shall be placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall\n        be placed on the agenda of the subsequent Supervisory Body meeting.\n\n6.2.3.3.        Finalizing a request for deviation\n118.    If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting in accordance with\n        paragraph 111 or 117 above, it shall decide on the course of action at the meeting.\n119.    The course of action shall be to:\n        (a)     Approve the deviation and allow submission of a request for registration with the\n                deviation; or\n        (b)     Reject the request.\n120.    Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n        DOE of the decision, the reasons thereof and any guidance provided by the Supervisory\n        Body as applicable, and make the decision, reasons and guidance publicly available on\n\n\n\n                                                 26 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        the UNFCCC website by publishing a ruling note within three days of the decision of the\n        Supervisory Body.\n\n6.2.3.4.        Withdrawal of a request for deviation\n\n6.2.3.4.1.      Submission of a request for withdrawal\n121.    For the following cases, the DOE shall submit a request for withdrawal of a request for\n        deviation to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website:\n        (a)     The activity participants voluntarily wish for the request for deviation to be\n                withdrawn;15\n        (b)     The DOE has new insights or information.\n\n6.2.3.4.2.      Processing of a request for withdrawal\n122.    Upon receipt of the request for withdrawal of a request for deviation, the secretariat shall\n        check the information provided as soon as possible. The secretariat shall reimburse the\n        deviation consideration fee, if applicable, in accordance with Appendix 1. If the withdrawal\n        occurs after the request for deviation is published in accordance with paragraph 110\n        above, the secretariat shall mark the deviation as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.2.4. Inclusion of component project\n123.    If the DOE confirms that the proposed CP complies with the requirements for inclusion of\n        CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above, it shall include the\n        specific CP in the PoA by uploading the corresponding CP-DD through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website together with the “Component project inclusion form”,\n        the validation report and a declaration that the development, implementation and\n        operation of the proposed CP do not involve any illegal activities, including money\n        laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery or other criminal activities. Such an upload shall be\n        made only after the registration of the PoA.\n124.    Once the documents referred to in paragraph 123 above are uploaded, the secretariat\n        shall automatically check, through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n        whether the inclusion of the CP would cause the total annual GHG emission reductions or\n        net removals for the registered A6.4 PoA to exceed the maximum amount approved by\n        the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above. If the total annual amount exceeds the\n        maximum annual amount approved by the host Party, the dedicated interface shall\n        automatically block the processing of the uploaded documents. Otherwise the secretariat\n        shall issue a statement of the CP inclusion fee due (or a confirmation that no CP inclusion\n        fee is due), determined in accordance with the provisions on the registration fee contained\n        in Appendix 1, and communicate it to the DOE.\n125.    The processes for payment of the CP inclusion fee by the activity participants and\n        submission of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of non-payment of\n        the CP inclusion fee within the deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions for the\n        registration fee contained in paragraphs 47-49 above, mutatis mutandis.\n126.    The CP described in the CP-DD, as uploaded by the DOE, will be included in the registered\n        A6.4 PoA and displayed on the activity view page of that PoA on the UNFCCC website\n\n15 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 27 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        after the CP inclusion fee is processed. The secretariat shall automatically notify the DOE,\n        the activity participants and the DNA of the host Party of the CP of the change in status of\n        the PoA, and shall assess, on a sample basis, the inclusion of CPs in accordance with the\n        process referred to in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above, mutatis mutandis.\n127.    If the methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines applied to the\n        registered A6.4 PoA are put on hold or withdrawn for any reason other than their\n        consolidation into a new methodology, no new CPs shall be included in the PoA until the\n        PoA-DD is revised to be in line with the revised or new applicable methodologies,\n        methodological tools and/or standardized baselines in accordance with the process in\n        section 6.4 below. Any new CPs submitted before the put-on-hold or withdrawal of the\n        applied methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines, but for which\n        the proof of payment for the CP inclusion fee has not been received by the secretariat\n        within the timeline specified in paragraph 125 above shall not be included in the PoA.\n\n6.2.5. Review of erroneous inclusion of component projects\n128.    If the DNA of any host Party, any other participating Party of a registered A6.4 PoA or a\n        member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body identifies information that may\n        disqualify the CP from inclusion in the PoA, they shall request a review of the inclusion of\n        the CP by notifying the secretariat within one year after the inclusion of the CP in the PoA,\n        or within 180 days after the first issuance of A6.4ERs for that CP, by submitting a\n        completed “Component project inclusion review form”. Such request for review shall be\n        related to issues associated with the compliance of the CP with the requirements for\n        inclusion of CPs in the PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above.\n129.    If the request is received from a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body,\n        the Chair of the Supervisory Body, in consultation with the secretariat, shall assess the\n        information referred to in paragraph 128 above and decide, within 14 days, whether to add\n        the request for review to the agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body.\n130.    If the Chair of the Supervisory Body decides not to add the request for review to the\n        agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n        relevant Supervisory Body member or alternate member of the reasons for this decision.\n131.    If the Chair of the Supervisory Body decides to add the request for review to the agenda\n        of the next meeting of the Supervisory Body, or if the request for review of the inclusion of\n        the CP has been received from the DNA of any host Party or any other participating Party\n        of a registered PoA, the secretariat shall accordingly notify the activity participants, the\n        DOE referred to in paragraph 97 above (hereinafter referred to as validating DOE) and the\n        DNAs of all Parties involved in the A6.4 PoA. The activity participants and the validating\n        DOE shall provide initial comments on the request for review no later than 28 days from\n        the date of notification of the review.\n132.    If the request for review is added to the agenda of the next meeting of the Supervisory\n        Body in accordance with paragraph 131 above, the Supervisory Body, taking into account\n        any comments received from the activity participants and the validating DOE, shall either:\n        (a)     Confirm the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA; or\n        (b)     Exclude the CP from the registered A6.4 PoA with immediate effect if it determines\n                that the CP was erroneously included in the PoA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 28 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n133.    If the Supervisory Body determines that the consideration of a request for review as per\n        paragraph 131 above or of an issue identified by the secretariat on the basis of a sample\n        assessment as per paragraph 126 above that raises concerns regarding the processes\n        used to include CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA, the Supervisory Body shall initiate a full\n        review of all CPs included in the PoA.\n134.    If the Supervisory Body initiates the full review referred to in paragraph 133 above, it shall\n        request the secretariat to contract a DOE that has not performed validation, CP inclusion\n        or verification functions with regard to this registered A6.4 PoA, to review all the CPs that\n        have been included in the PoA in the one-year period or have had their first issuance in\n        the 180-day period preceding the request for review. The DOE shall submit a review report\n        to the secretariat within 30 days.\n135.    The Supervisory Body shall establish an assessment team to analyse the DOE’s review\n        report and provide findings and recommendations to the Supervisory Body within 14 days.\n        The assessment team may discuss the findings of the DOE’s review report and seek\n        comments from the activity participants and the validating DOE, as appropriate. Based on\n        this assessment, the assessment team shall make a finding as to whether:\n        (a)     Any specific CPs were erroneously included in the registered A6.4 PoA;\n        (b)     Compliance of each of the CPs reviewed with respect to the requirements for\n                inclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA as referred to in paragraph 95 above\n                was adequately assessed by the validating DOE in accordance with the validation\n                and verification standard and other Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements\n                applicable at the time of inclusion.\n136.    The Supervisory Body shall consider both the DOE’s review report and the assessment\n        team’s findings at its next meeting for which the report and the findings have been made\n        available by the 14-day documentation deadline.\n137.    The Supervisory Body shall decide to exclude any specific CPs from the registered A6.4\n        PoA if it concludes that they have been erroneously included.\n138.    A CP that has been excluded after having been identified as erroneously included in the\n        registered A6.4 PoA may be re-included in the same or different registered A6.4 PoA or\n        registered as an A6.4 project. For re-inclusion in the same or different PoA, the relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard, the validation and verification standard and the\n        process in subsections 6.2.1–6.2.3 above shall apply. For registration as an A6.4 project,\n        the relevant requirements in the “Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard for projects” and\n        “Article 6.4 mechanism validation and verification standard for projects” and the relevant\n        process in the “Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for projects” shall apply.\n139.    Where, for any of the specific CPs excluded in accordance with paragraph 132(b) or 137\n        above, the Supervisory Body determines that the validating DOE failed to adequately\n        assess their compliance with the requirements for inclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4\n        PoA in accordance with the validation and verification standard, the DOE shall have its\n        performance evaluated according to the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of\n        designated operational entities” and the DOE shall acquire and transfer, within 30 days of\n        the exclusion of the CPAs, an amount of A6.4ERs equivalent to the amount of A6.4ERs\n        issued for the CPs as a result of the CPs having been included to the cancellation account\n        in the mechanism registry.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n6.3.    Continuous engagement of stakeholders\n140.    Any time after the registration of a PoA under the Article 6.4 mechanism, Parties,\n        stakeholders, and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations may submit comments in\n        English on the registered A6.4 PoA or any CP included therein to the secretariat through\n        a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website. The submitters of the comments shall\n        provide the name and contact details of the individual or organization on whose behalf the\n        comments are submitted. Comments from stakeholders shall:\n        (a)     Be specific to the registered A6.4 PoA or any CP included therein;\n        (b)     Relate to compliance with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and regulations.\n141.    The secretariat shall promptly make the comments that meet the requirements in\n        paragraph 140 above publicly available on the UNFCCC website where the PoA\n        information is displayed and inform the activity participants of the publication of the\n        comments.\n\n6.4.    Change to registered programme of activities\n\n6.4.1. General requirements\n142.    If a change occurred or is expected to occur to a registered A6.4 PoA, such a change\n        (hereinafter referred to as post-registration change to the PoA) shall be approved by the\n        Supervisory Body in accordance with this section to maintain the registration status under\n        the Article 6.4 mechanism. The post-registration change to the PoA shall not affect the\n        CPs included until the renewal of the crediting period of the CPs, shall fall within the scope\n        of the following acceptable changes and shall meet the associated conditions, as specified\n        in the activity standard:\n        (a)     Permanent changes:\n                (i)     Corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of achieved\n                        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (ii)    Permanent changes to the description of how to develop the monitoring plan\n                        for each CP as per the corresponding generic CP-DD as described in the\n                        registered PoA-DD, or permanent deviation of monitoring from the applied\n                        methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n                        methodological regulatory documents;\n                (iii)   Changes to the programme design;\n                (iv)    Addition of a generic CP-DD;\n        (b)     Changes due to a revision of a methodology, methodological tool and/or\n                standardized baselines applied by the generic CPs;\n        (c)     Registration or coverage under, or overlap with other, crediting schemes, other\n                frameworks or environmental markets.\n\n6.4.2. Update of documents and validation or verification\n143.    For any permanent changes referred to in paragraph 142(a) above, the activity\n        participants shall revise the PoA-DD to reflect these post-registration changes. The activity\n\n\n\n                                                 30 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        participants shall submit the revised PoA-DD and any other supporting documentation to\n        a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity\n        participants to perform validation of the post-registration change to the PoA. In this context,\n        if the activity participants wish to appoint this DOE to submit the request for approval of\n        the post-registration change to the PoA under the issuance track referred to in\n        paragraph 146 below, the selection of a DOE shall follow the same rule referred to in\n        paragraph 202 below.\n144.    For the permanent change referred to in paragraph 142(b) above, the validity of the\n        version of the methodology or methodological tool and of standardized baselines applied\n        by generic CPs shall follow the rules contained, respectively, in the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and\n        the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized\n        baselines”. After the validity of the previous version of the methodology or methodological\n        tool and of the standardized baseline expires, the activity participants may submit a\n        request for post-registration change to the PoA by updating the PoA-DD including, inter\n        alia, updating the eligibility criteria for the inclusion of CPs in the PoA to be in line with the\n        revised methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines. However,\n        such revision to the PoA-DD is not required if the methodologies or methodological tools\n        are revised or withdrawn to be included in consolidated methodologies without being\n        placed on hold, unless otherwise indicated in the report of the Supervisory Body meeting\n        at which the Supervisory Body approved the revised or consolidated methodologies or\n        methodological tools.\n145.    The CPs that were included before the revision of the PoA-DD shall apply the latest\n        version of the PoA-DD only at the time of the renewal of their crediting periods. If the\n        activity participants do not wish to revise the PoA-DD to apply the revised version of the\n        methodology, no new CPs shall be included in the PoA.\n\n6.4.3. Submission of a request for approval of a post-registration change\n146.    After validating that the post-registration changes to the PoA meet all applicable\n        requirements for post-registration changes in the activity standard by following the\n        applicable provisions of the validation and verification standard and other applicable\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a request for\n        approval of post-registration change. The request for approval shall be submitted either\n        prior to submitting a request for issuance of A6.4ERs that are affected by the post-\n        registration change (prior-approval track), or together with a request for issuance of\n        A6.4ERs (issuance track). The choice of whether the DOE submits the request for\n        approval via the prior-approval track or the issuance track shall be at the discretion of the\n        activity participants, who may consider the indicative list of post-registration changes that\n        may be suitable for approval under the issuance track outlined in Appendix 2.\n147.    A request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA of the permanent changes\n        referred to in paragraph 142(a) above shall be submitted as follows, irrespective of\n        whether it is under the prior-approval track or the issuance track:\n        (a)     At anytime for corrections that do not have material impact on the calculation of\n                achieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n        (b)     No later than the first issuance request for permanent changes to the description\n                of how to develop the monitoring plan for each CP as per the corresponding\n                generic CP-DD as described in the PoA-DD of the registered A6.4 PoA;\n\n\n\n                                                 31 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     No later than one year after the occurrence of the permanent changes to the\n                programme design.\n148.    A request for approval of a post-registration change to the PoA of the changes referred to\n        in paragraph 142(b) above may be submitted once the Supervisory Body adopts a revised\n        version of the methodology. No new CPs shall be included in the PoA after the end of the\n        validity period of the previous version of the methodology or methodological tool, until the\n        request for post-registration change to the PoA is approved by the Supervisory Body.\n149.    Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 142 above have occurred\n        or are expected to occur to the registered A6.4 PoA, the DOE shall, wherever possible,\n        combine such changes into one request for approval of post-registration change to the\n        PoA.\n150.    Under both the prior-approval track and the issuance track, the DOE shall submit a request\n        for approval of post-registration change to the PoA to the secretariat through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website, attaching:\n        (a)     The revised PoA-DD (in both clean and track-change versions) or a monitoring\n                report, as applicable, and any supporting documentation, prepared by the activity\n                participants in accordance with the activity standard;\n        (b)     The validation report on the post-registration change to the PoA prepared by the\n                DOE in accordance with the validation and verification standard.\n151.    The secretariat shall issue a statement of the post-registration change fee due, or\n        confirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with\n        the provisions on the post-registration change fee contained in Appendix 1, and shall\n        communicate it to the DOE.\n152.    The processes for payment of the post-registration change fee by the activity participants\n        and submission of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of no-payment\n        of the post-registration change fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding\n        provisions for the registration fee contained in paragraphs 47‒49 above, mutatis mutandis.\n        The secretariat shall publish the submitted request for post-registration change on the\n        UNFCCC website after receiving the proof of payment of the post-registration change fee.\n\n6.4.4. Processing of request for approval of post-registration change\n153.    Any post-registration changes to the PoA that may result in an increase in the maximum\n        annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be\n        achieved by the PoA that was previously approved by the host Party in accordance with\n        paragraph 25(d) above shall be newly approved by the host Party. If the PoA has more\n        than one host Party, approval is required only from the Party(ies) relevant to the increase\n        in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n        resulting from the post-registration change to the PoA. Upon receiving a request for such\n        approval of post-registration changes, the secretariat shall, immediately after publishing\n        the request on the UNFCCC website in accordance with paragraph 152 above, notify the\n        relevant host Party(ies) of the receipt of the request, and request them to respond with\n        regard to the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net\n\n\n\n\n                                                 32 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        GHG removals within 60 days of the notification or in any longer timeframe to be indicated\n        by the host Party(ies), through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website by:\n        (a)     Approving the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission\n                reductions or net GHG removals relevant to the host Party resulting from the post-\n                registration change to the PoA, or\n        (b)     Rejecting the increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission\n                reductions or net GHG removals relevant to the host Party resulting from the post-\n                registration change to the PoA.\n154.    The secretariat shall, upon receipt of the response from the relevant host Party(ies), inform\n        the activity participants and the DOE of the response and publish the response on the\n        UNFCCC website.\n155.    For processing of the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA, the\n        provisions in section 5.1.2 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.4.5. Requesting review of request for approval of post-registration change\n156.    For requesting review of the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA,\n        the provisions in section 5.1.3 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.4.6. Finalizing request for approval of post-registration change if there is no request for\n       review\n157.    For finalizing the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA if no request\n        for review is received by the secretariat within the 28-day deadline, the provisions in\n        section 5.1.4 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis, except for the provision on the start\n        date of the first PoA period, which is not applicable.\n\n6.4.7. Review of request for approval of post-registration change\n158.    For a review of the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA, the\n        provisions in section 5.2 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.4.8. Withdrawal of request for approval of post-registration change\n159.    For a withdrawal of the request for approval of post-registration change to the PoA, the\n        provisions in section 5.3 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis.\n\n6.5.    Change to component projects\n\n6.5.1. General requirements\n160.    If a change has occurred or is expected to occur to an included CP, such a change\n        (hereinafter referred to as post-registration change to included CP) shall be notified in\n        accordance with this section to maintain the inclusion status under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism. The post-registration change to an included CP shall fall within the scope of\n        the following acceptable changes categories, and meet the associated conditions, as\n        specified in the activity standard:\n        (a)     Temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan as described in the CP-\n                DD, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form, and\n\n\n                                                 33 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), applied methodologies,\n                standardized baselines or other methodological regulatory documents, including\n                the A6.4 SD Tool;\n        (b)     Permanent changes:\n                (i)     Corrections that do not have a material impact on the calculation of achieved\n                        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (ii)    Changes to the start date of the crediting period.\n                (iii)   Inclusion of a monitoring plan;\n                (iv)    Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan in the CP-DD, the A6.4\n                        SD Tool forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                        assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form\n                        and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation\n                        of monitoring from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or\n                        other methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;\n                (v)     Changes to the project design;\n        (c)     Registration or coverage under, or overlap, of the CP with other crediting schemes,\n                other frameworks or environmental markets.\n\n6.5.2. Update of documents and validation or verification\n161.    For the temporary deviation referred to in paragraph 160(a) above, the activity participants\n        shall describe the deviation in the monitoring report, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4\n        Environmental and social management plan form and/or A6.4 Sustainable development\n        impact form) in accordance with the activity standard as part of the preparation of a\n        monitoring report in accordance with section 7.1 below and relevant provisions of the A6.4\n        SD Tool, as applicable, for the monitoring period that covers the period during which the\n        temporary deviation occurred. The deviation shall be subsequently verified by a DOE for\n        requesting issuance for the monitoring period in accordance with sections 7.2 and 9.1\n        below.\n162.    For any of the permanent changes referred to in paragraph 160(b) above, the activity\n        participants shall:\n        (a)     Revise the CP-DD, to reflect the post-registration change;\n        (b)     Submit the revised CP-DD and any other supporting documentation to a DOE\n                accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity\n                participants to perform validation of the post-registration change;\n        (c)     Revise the PoA-DD and obtain approval from both the host Party and the\n                Supervisory Body of the request for post-registration change to the PoA as per\n                sections 6.4.4−6.4.7 above. This applies in the case of any changes to the CP that\n                may result in exceeding the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions\n                or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by CPs that may be included in the\n                registered PoA, such as but not limited to:\n                (i)     An increase of capacity leading to estimated GHG emission reductions or net\n                        GHG removals from all included CPs exceeding the maximum annual\n\n\n\n                                                 34 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                       amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be\n                       achieved by CPs that may be included in the registered PoA that was\n                       originally approved by the host Party;16\n                (ii)   The addition of a technology/measure, that either:\n                        a.     Results in estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                               from all included CPs exceeding the maximum annual amount of\n                               GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be\n                               achieved by CPs that may be included in the PoA approved by the\n                               host Party,17 or\n                        b.     Does not comply with the eligible technologies/measures covered by\n                               the registered PoA.\n\n6.5.3. Submission of notification of post-registration change\n163.    After validating that the post-registration changes to the included CP meet all applicable\n        requirements for post-registration changes in the activity standard by following the\n        applicable provisions of the validation and verification standard and other applicable\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall submit a notification of post-\n        registration change to the included CP prior to submitting a request for issuance of\n        A6.4ERs for the PoA that are affected by the post-registration change.\n164.    A notification of post-registration change to the included CP of the permanent changes\n        referred to in paragraph 160(b) above shall be submitted:\n        (a)     Any time for corrections that do not have a material impact on the calculation of\n                achieved GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n        (b)     No later than the first issuance request for inclusion of a monitoring plan;\n        (c)     No later than one year after the occurrence of the permanent changes to the\n                registered monitoring plan of the included CP, permanent deviation of monitoring\n                from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or other methodological\n                regulatory documents, or the permanent change to the project design.\n165.    Where more than one of the changes referred to in paragraph 160 above have occurred\n        or are expected to occur to the included CP, the DOE shall, wherever possible, combine\n        such changes into one notification of post-registration change.\n\n\n\n\n16 If the increase of capacity does not lead to estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n\n  from all included CPs that exceeds the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net\n  GHG removals expected to be achieved by CPs, activity participants shall ensure that the additionality\n  of the CP still complies with the eligibility criteria on additionality in the registered PoA-DD.\n17 Post-registration changes to the project design involving the addition of a technology/measure shall not\n\n  trigger a post-registration change to the programme design if the technology/measure is covered in the\n  eligibility criteria of the registered PoA and if the addition of the technology/measure in the CP does not\n  lead to exceeding the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n  expected to be achieved by CP.\n\n\n                                                 35 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n166.    The DOE shall submit a notification of post-registration change to the included CP to the\n        secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, attaching:\n        (a)     The revised CP-DD (in both clean and track-change versions) and any supporting\n                documentation, prepared by the activity participants in accordance with the activity\n                standard;\n        (b)     The validation report on the post-registration change prepared by the DOE in\n                accordance with the validation and verification standard.\n\n6.5.4. Processing of notification of post-registration change\n167.    The secretariat shall issue a statement of the post-registration change fee due, or\n        confirmation that no post-registration change fee is due, determined in accordance with\n        the provisions for the post-registration change fee outlined in Appendix 1, and shall\n        communicate it to the DOE.\n168.    The processes for paying the post-registration change fee by the activity participants and\n        submitting a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequences of non-payment of the\n        post-registration change fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions\n        for the registration fee contained in paragraphs 47-49 above, mutatis mutandis.\n169.    The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list of all submitted notifications of post-\n        registration changes to CPs on the UNFCCC website. The secretariat shall assess the\n        notifications of post-registration changes on a sample basis.\n170.    Notifications of post-registration changes to included CPs selected for assessment by the\n        secretariat shall be further processed, finalized and withdrawn, as applicable, in\n        accordance with the provisions in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above, mutatis mutandis. If the\n        Supervisory Body rejects a change to a CP, the secretariat shall assess all other post-\n        registration changes of the same type to CPs that have been notified, by following the\n        provisions in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above, mutatis mutandis.\n171.    A notification of post-registration changes to a CP that has not been selected for\n        assessment by the secretariat will be automatically displayed on the activity view page of\n        the registered A6.4 PoA on the UNFCCC website. The secretariat shall automatically\n        notify the DOE, the activity participants and the DNA of the relevant host Party of the\n        change to the CP.\n172.    If the DNA of any host Party, any other participating Party of a registered A6.4 PoA or a\n        Supervisory Body member or alternate member identifies information that may prohibit the\n        notified change, they shall request a review of the notification of change to the CP by\n        notifying the Secretary of the Supervisory Body. This request shall be submitted within\n        one year of the notification of change being posted on the UNFCCC web page in\n        accordance with paragraph 171 above, by submitting a completed “Component project\n        activity inclusion review form”. The review of the notification of change shall follow the\n        provisions of section 6.2.5 above, mutatis mutandis.\n173.    The secretariat shall make the revised CP-DD and the validation report publicly available\n        on the UNFCCC website. This version of the CP-DD shall be applied for future requests\n        for issuance for the registered A6.4 PoA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 36 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n174.    Notwithstanding paragraphs 167−173 above, the processing of post-registration changes\n        cases relating to the A6.4 SD Tool forms, shall follow, mutatis mutandis, the provisions of\n        sections 5.1.2−5.3 above.\n175.    Notwithstanding paragraph 174 above, for cases of post-registration changes relating to\n        the A6.4 SD Tool forms, if the secretariat, during the preparation of the summary note,\n        identifies issues that require inputs from the Supervisory Body approved roster of experts,\n        it shall send the case to an appropriate expert. The selected expert shall provide their\n        inputs within seven days of the receipt of the request. In this case, the secretariat shall,\n        finalize the summary note and send it to the Supervisory Body within 14 days of receipt of\n        the inputs from the expert.\n\n6.6.    Change to modalities of communication\n\n6.6.1. General requirements\n176.    If there is a change to the MoC statement, the focal points for scope (b) of the registered\n        A6.4 PoA referred to in paragraph 34 above, shall request approval of the change from\n        the secretariat as soon as possible but no later than 90 days after the change takes place.\n177.    Authorized signatories or legal representatives of the activity participants, focal points, or\n        DNAs of the host Party or any other Parties participating in the A6.4 PoA may directly\n        notify the secretariat of any issues regarding the MoC statement through a designated e-\n        mail account provided in the mechanism registry section of the UNFCCC website. In this\n        case, the secretariat may request additional clarifications from the notifier. The secretariat\n        may contact any focal points or activity participants of the respective registered A6.4 PoA\n        or the liquidators/administrators in cases of insolvency to request additional clarifications.\n        The secretariat shall advise the parties involved with regard to further necessary actions,\n        including those referred to in section 6.6.2 below.\n178.    The secretariat may request a new submission of an MoC statement whenever it identifies\n        or is notified of inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the MoC statement. The secretariat may\n        provide specific guidance for the resubmission. In its role as the mechanism registry\n        administrator, the secretariat may, after notifying the focal points and the activity\n        participants, temporarily put on hold the forwarding of A6.4ERs if the inconsistencies or\n        inaccuracies prevent the secretariat from establishing the focal points for scope of\n        authority (a), pending resolution of the inconsistencies or inaccuracies.\n179.    The focal points for scope (b) shall request approval of the change to the modalities of\n        communication from the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n        website by uploading a new MoC statement using the valid version of the “Modalities of\n        communication statement form”.\n180.    The focal points for scope (b) or the activity participants who submit a new MoC statement\n        in accordance with paragraph 189 below shall ensure that:\n        (a)     Supporting documentation, including powers of attorney, extracts from board\n                meeting minutes, company association documentation or extracts/certificates from\n                national company registries that cannot be verified online, is dated, or notarized\n                within six months from the time of submission of a request for change to the MoC\n                statement. This time limitation does not apply to copies of national personal identity\n                documents;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     To the extent possible, changes applicable to more than one A6.4 PoA or multiple\n                changes affecting the same PoA are consolidated in a single change request in\n                accordance with the instructions provided in the mechanism registry section of the\n                UNFCCC website.\n181.    The legal representatives signing on behalf of the focal points or the activity participants\n        shall provide written evidence that they are authorized to sign on behalf of the respective\n        entities. The evidence shall be submitted in accordance with paragraph 180(a) above.\n182.    The secretariat shall process the request for approval of changes to the MoC statement\n        following the steps described in sections 6.6.2–6.6.4 below. Wherever specific steps are\n        not described, the secretariat shall review the request considering compliance with the\n        documentation requirements. In the absence of clear evidence to support a specific\n        request, the secretariat may request additional information prior to approving or rejecting\n        the request. In the case of a rejection, the secretariat shall provide reasons for the rejection\n        and additional guidance as appropriate.\n183.    The secretariat shall make detailed guidance available on the mechanism registry\n        section of the UNFCCC website on how to request changes to the activity participants and\n        focal points.\n184.    The secretariat shall display the effective date of the new MoC statement on the activity\n        dedicated view page of the A6.4 PoA on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.6.2. Reported issues resulting from insolvency and/or disputes on modalities of\n       communication\n185.    The activity participants or focal points may notify the secretariat of any issues regarding\n        the MoC statement, in accordance with paragraph 177 above including those arising from\n        insolvency and/or disputes with regard to the designation or changes to the designation\n        of focal points.\n186.    The secretariat may engage the DNAs of the host Parties or any other Parties participating\n        in the respective registered A6.4 PoA whenever issues arising from insolvency and/or\n        disputes over the designation of focal points are communicated to it. The secretariat may\n        provide information, subject to the confidentiality of such information, and/or administrative\n        assistance to the DNAs, upon request by the respective DNAs.\n187.    The secretariat, in its role as the mechanism registry administrator, may, after notifying\n        the focal points and the activity participants, temporarily put on hold the forwarding of\n        A6.4ERs for the registered A6.4 PoA for which the activity participants or the focal points\n        have communicated a case of insolvency and/or a dispute in relation to the MoC\n        statement, pending resolution of the issues resulting from insolvency or resolution of the\n        disputes.\n188.    The secretariat shall display, subject to confidentiality requirements, indicative information\n        related to the notifications to the secretariat of issues resulting from insolvency and/or of\n        disputes on the activity view page of the registered A6.4 PoA on the UNFCCC website,\n        only in cases where the forwarding of A6.4ERs has been temporarily put on hold pending\n        the resolution of the issues, in accordance with paragraph 187 above.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n6.6.3. Changes of focal points\n189.    Activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA may change the designation of any of the\n        focal points for any reason and at any time by submitting a new MoC statement duly signed\n        by all activity participants, either through:\n        (a)     The focal points for scope of authority (b); or\n        (b)     Any of the activity participants, in cases of changes made to the MoC statement,\n                excluding its annexes.\n190.    For changing the designation of focal points in accordance with paragraph 189 above, the\n        submission shall be made as follows:\n        (a)     A new MoC statement for changes related to the designation of focal points, with\n                the exception of changes affecting only contact details and authorized signatories;\n        (b)     Annex 2 to the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication statement\n                form”, for changes related only to contact details and authorized signatories.\n191.    When a focal point who is not an activity participant is added to represent the activity\n        participants for any or all scopes of authority, the new MoC statement referred to in\n        paragraph 190(a) above shall be supported by written evidence of:\n        (a)     The new focal point’s corporate identity, if applicable;\n        (b)     The personal identity and employment status of the new focal point’s authorized\n                signatory(ies), including specimen signature(s).\n192.    The legal representative of a focal point for scope of authority (b) may submit a new\n        annex 2 to the MoC statement if the authorized signatory(ies) of the focal point concerned\n        is/are no longer available.\n193.    Any focal point of a registered A6.4 PoA may request a voluntary withdrawal from its role\n        as a focal point. Such a request shall cover all scopes of authority assumed by the focal\n        point. The voluntary withdrawal process shall follow the following steps:\n        (a)     The withdrawing focal point shall, directly or through the focal point for scope (b),\n                submit a withdrawal request to the secretariat including:\n                (i)    Annex 3 of the MoC statement, using the “Modalities of communication\n                       statement form”;\n                (ii)   Evidence of the written communication, sent by the withdrawing focal point\n                       to all other focal points and activity participants, indicating its intention to\n                       withdraw from its role as a focal point, and inviting the designation of a new\n                       focal point for the scope(s) of authority from which the focal point is\n                       withdrawing. Such written communications shall be made at least 30 days\n                       prior to the submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.\n        (b)     The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if it is found\n                complete, approve the withdrawal of the focal point. In doing so, the secretariat\n                may request clarification from the withdrawing focal point, or may contact any of\n                the other focal points or the activity participants to request additional clarifications;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 39 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     Upon approval of the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat shall publish the\n                new annex 3 of the MoC statement on the UNFCCC website. Additionally, the\n                secretariat shall communicate the approval of the withdrawal of the focal point and\n                its implications on the MoC to all remaining focal points and activity participants of\n                the PoA;\n        (d)     The approved withdrawal of a focal point shall have no effect on other focal points,\n                except in cases where the withdrawn focal point was part of joint focal point roles.\n                In such cases, the remaining focal points shall continue to act in a sole or joint focal\n                point role, as appropriate. If no focal point remains for a specific scope of authority\n                after the withdrawal of the focal point, the secretariat shall promptly notify the\n                withdrawal to the remaining focal points for other scopes of authority, or to all\n                activity participants if no focal point remains. The activity participants shall\n                designate a new focal point for any scope of authority for which no focal point\n                remains in accordance with the provisions of this section, to enable further\n                engagement with the Supervisory Body and the secretariat.\n\n6.6.4.

For the changes listed in paragraph 194(a) and (b) above, the secretariat shall notify the\n        DNA of the host Party or any other relevant Party participating in the A6.4 PoA of the\n        requested change through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website referred to in\n        paragraphs 24 and 28 above, and request them to respond whether to approve the\n        change.\n196.    An activity participant added to a registered A6.4 PoA shall accept the existing MoC\n        statement, or a new MoC statement if submitted simultaneously.\n197.    If persistent efforts to contact an activity participant has failed, the focal points for scope\n        of authority (b) may request the administrative withdrawal of the activity participant,\n        provided that at least one activity participant authorized by the DNA of the host Party\n        remains. The administrative withdrawal shall follow the following steps:\n        (a)     The focal points for scope (b) shall submit:\n                (i)   Annex 2 of the MoC statement, withdrawing the non-contactable activity\n                      participant;\n\n\n\n                                                 40 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                (ii)   Evidence of written communication to the non-contactable activity participant\n                       stating the intention to request administrative withdrawal, including a copy of\n                       the communication sent to the DNA that authorized the activity participants\n                       to participate in the PoA, that has been sent at least 15 days prior to the\n                       submission of the withdrawal request to the secretariat.\n        (b)     The secretariat shall review the completeness of the submission and, if it is found\n                complete, send an e-mail to the non-contactable activity participant, with a copy to\n                the authorizing DNA, asking whether the activity participant objects to the\n                administrative withdrawal and requesting to respond within 30 days. The\n                secretariat may also use other communication channels to establish contact with\n                the non-contactable activity participant;\n        (c)     If neither the non-contactable activity participant nor the authorizing DNA object to\n                proceeding with the administrative withdrawal within 30 days of the electronic\n                communication made in accordance with subparagraph (b) above, the secretariat\n                shall mark the non-contactable activity participant as “withdrawn” on the UNFCCC\n                website;\n        (d)     If the non-contactable activity participant or the authorizing DNA objects to the\n                administrative withdrawal within the 30-day period mentioned in subparagraph (b)\n                above, the secretariat shall reject the request for withdrawal and may advise the\n                focal point for scope (b) on further actions;\n        (e)     Activity participants whose participation in the PoA has been administratively\n                withdrawn may request to be included as activity participants of the same PoA any\n                time thereafter in accordance with 194(a) above.\n198.    Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraphs 197(b)−(e) above activity participants of a\n        registered A6.4 PoA may directly request the following, by submitting annex 2 of the MoC\n        statement:\n        (a)     Their own voluntary withdrawal, provided that at least one activity participant\n                authorized by the DNA of any of the host Parties to participate in the PoA remains;\n        (b)     Changes to their own names, legal statuses or contact details;\n        (c)     Withdrawal of other activity participants of the same PoA based on their cessation\n                accompanied by documented evidence of the cessation;\n        (d)     Administrative withdrawal of other activity participants of the same PoA who are\n                not contactable provided that the submission shall be accompanied by the written\n                evidence referred to in paragraph 197(a)(ii) above.\n199.    The secretariat may effect the withdrawal of an activity participant that has ceased to exist,\n        provided that the cessation can be unambiguously confirmed though the relevant official\n        company registrar.\n200.    In cases as per paragraph 194(b) above, where the change relates to the name or legal\n        status of the activity participant, and in cases referred to in paragraph 199 above, the\n        secretariat shall notify the DNA that had authorized the activity participant. Additionally,\n        the secretariat shall request the DNA to confirm whether to approve the change of the\n        name or legal status of the activity participant or the withdrawal of an activity participant\n        through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n                                                 41 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n7.      Pre-issuance activities\n7.1.    Preparation of monitoring report\n201.    Activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA shall prepare for each monitoring period and\n        in accordance with the activity standard, using the “Monitoring report form for PoAs”. The\n        monitoring report shall be prepared as follows:\n        (a)     A single monitoring report for all CPs implemented in a single host Party and\n                included in the PoA in a single batch (hereinafter referred to as single batch of\n                CPs); or\n        (b)     Multiple separate monitoring reports for different batches of CPs, provided that\n                these batches of CPs have the same monitoring period and apply the same version\n                of the methodology (hereinafter referred to as multiple batches of CPs). For multi-\n                country PoAs, each of the batches of CPs shall include only CPs monitored in the\n                same host Party.\n\n7.2.    Verification of emission reductions or removals\n202.    Activity participants shall submit the monitoring report(s) and any other supporting\n        documentation to a DOE accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by\n        the activity participants to perform verification of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals. In this regard, the selection of the DOEs to perform the verification shall follow\n        the requirements below:\n        (a)     A DOE that performed the validation for registration of the PoA shall not be\n                selected to perform the first verification for the PoA;\n        (b)     A DOE that performed the validation for renewal of the PoA period shall not be\n                selected to perform the first verification for the PoA after the renewal of the PoA\n                period;\n        (c)     A DOE that performed the validation for inclusion of a CP shall not be selected to\n                perform the first verification of the request for issuance involving that CP;\n        (d)     A DOE that performed the validation for renewal of the crediting period of a CP\n                shall not be selected to perform the first verification of a request for issuance\n                involving that CP after the renewal of its the crediting period.\n203.    The DOE shall:\n        (a)     Verify whether the implementation of the CPs, and the monitoring and calculation\n                of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals comply with the relevant\n                requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4\n                mechanism rules and requirements. This verification shall be based on the\n                information provided in the monitoring report(s) and any supporting documentation\n                the DOE has received from the activity participants as well as further information\n                obtained during the verification activity; and\n        (b)     Prepare a single verification and certification report for a single batch of CPs or\n                separate reports for each of the multiple batches of CPs, in accordance with the\n                validation and verification standard, using the “Verification and certification report\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n                form for PoAs”. The DOE shall verify and certify for the entire monitoring period\n                covered by the monitoring report.\n204.    If the DOE or activity participants identify that the total amount of GHG emission reductions\n        or net GHG removals requested for issuance, combined with the cumulative amount of\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals issued for the PoA would exceed the\n        maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by\n        the host Party under paragraph 25(d) above, a post-registration change to the PoA shall\n        be approved by the Supervisory Body prior to proceeding with the request for issuance, to\n        increase the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n        expected to be achieved by the PoA.\n205.    For the purpose of the potential selection of the verification activity for the performance\n        assessment of the DOE in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”, the\n        DOE shall notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n        of the scheduled site inspection for the CPs included in the batch of the request for\n        issuance, which is to be conducted in accordance with the validation and verification\n        standard, no later than four weeks prior to the inspection.\n\n8.

Issuance of Article 6.4 emission reductions\n9.1.    Request for issuance\n\n9.1.1. Submission of request for issuance\n217.    The DOE shall submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs to the secretariat after verifying\n        that the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4\n        PoA during the monitoring period covered by the monitoring report comply with all\n        applicable requirements for implementation and monitoring in the activity standard and\n        any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and certifying the\n        quantity of A6.4ERs that may be requested for issuance. The request for issuance shall\n        be submitted through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, including the\n        reference to the notification of the timing of the site inspection made in accordance with\n        paragraph 205 above and attaching along with the following attachments:\n        (a)     The monitoring report and any supporting documentation prepared by the activity\n                participants in accordance with paragraph 201 above and verified by the DOE in\n                accordance with paragraph 203 above;\n        (b)     The verification and certification report prepared by the DOE in accordance with\n                paragraph 203 above.\n218.    Requests for issuance for a registered A6.4 PoA shall be submitted in chronological order\n        of the monitoring periods covered by separate monitoring reports and shall not have gaps\n        between successive monitoring periods.\n219.    A request for issuance for a registered A6.4 PoA for a given monitoring period may be\n        separated into multiple requests for issuance, with each request based on different\n        monitoring reports covering mutually exclusive batches of CPs and for the same\n        monitoring period prepared in accordance with the activity standard. In this case, a request\n        for issuance for a batch of CPs for a subsequent monitoring period can only be submitted\n        after the requests for issuance for all batches of CPs for the previous monitoring period\n        have been submitted. The compositions of CPs within multiple batches may vary for\n        different monitoring periods.\n220.    Each request for issuance shall indicate the verified and certified GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals achieved by each CP for each vintage year in which they\n        occurred.\n221.    Requests for issuance for GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals occurring in a\n        crediting period of a CP shall be submitted within two years after the end of that crediting\n        period of the CP.23 If a submission was made after this deadline, A6.4ERs shall no longer\n        be issued for the CP for that crediting period.\n222.    Once the documents referred to in paragraph 217 above are uploaded, the secretariat\n        shall automatically verify through the dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n        whether the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals claimed in the\n\n23 The Supervisory Body may set a different deadline for removal projects in the future.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 46 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        request for issuance will fall within the maximum annual amount of GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals for the registered PoA approved by the host Party in\n        accordance with paragraph 25(d) or 153(a) above. If the total annual amount exceeds the\n        maximum annual amount approved by the host Party, the dedicated interface shall\n        automatically block the processing of the uploaded documents. Otherwise, the secretariat\n        shall issue a statement of the issuance fee due (or confirmation that no issuance fee is\n        due), determined in accordance with the provisions on the issuance fee in Appendix 1,\n        and communicate it to the DOE.\n223.    The activity participants shall pay the issuance fee by bank transfer, quoting the unique\n        PoA reference number referred to in paragraph 18 above, within one year of the issuance\n        to the DOE of the statement of the issuance fee due.\n224.    The DOE shall submit a proof of payment (e.g. bank transfer record) through a dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website.\n225.    If the secretariat does not receive the deposit of the issuance fee by the one-year deadline\n        referred to in paragraph 223 above, the request for issuance shall be deemed withdrawn.\n        The same or a different DOE may submit a new request for issuance for the monitoring\n        period covered by the withdrawn request for issuance anytime thereafter, following the\n        applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements valid at the time of the new\n        submission.\n226.    If the DOE submits a request for approval of a post-registration change to the PoA together\n        with the request for issuance in accordance with paragraph 146 above, it shall also submit\n        the documentation and information listed in paragraph 150 above in addition to those\n        referred to in paragraph 217 above.\n\n9.1.2. Processing of request for issuance\n227.    The secretariat shall maintain a publicly available list on the UNFCCC website of all\n        submitted requests for issuance for which the applicable issuance fee has been received\n        by the secretariat or for which no issuance fee is due. The secretariat shall make publicly\n        available the schedule and status of processing of each request for issuance. The\n        secretariat shall schedule the commencement of the processing of requests for issuance\n        in accordance with its operational plans, which incorporate monthly quotas and any\n        relevant instructions from the Supervisory Body.\n228.    The secretariat shall commence the completeness check stage in accordance with the\n        established schedule. Within seven days of the commencement of the completeness\n        check stage, the secretariat shall, subject to guidance from the Supervisory Body, conduct\n        a completeness check to determine whether the request for issuance submission is\n        complete in accordance with the completeness check checklist for requests for issuance.\n229.    If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies issues of an editorial nature or\n        consistency in the submission, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity\n        participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall\n        submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the\n        request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this\n        deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request for issuance submission is\n        incomplete unless the DOE provides a justification, by this deadline, for not being able to\n        submit the requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall\n        be extended accordingly.\n\n\n\n                                                 47 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n230.    The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        completeness check stage. If the request submission does not meet the requirements of\n        the completeness check, the secretariat shall also communicate the underlying reasons\n        to the activity participants and the DOE and make this information available on the\n        UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit the request for issuance with\n        revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request for issuance is made within 28\n        days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-commence the completeness\n        check; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new submission of a request for\n        issuance.\n231.    Upon a positive conclusion of the completeness check stage, the secretariat shall, subject\n        to guidance from the Supervisory Body, conduct a substantive check within 21 days in\n        accordance with the substantive checklist for requests for issuance.\n232.    If the secretariat, during the substantive check, identifies issues of a substantive nature or\n        missing basic information, it shall request the DOE by e-mail, copying the activity\n        participants, to submit revised documents and/or information. In this case, the DOE shall\n        submit the requested documents and/or information within seven days of receipt of the\n        request. If the DOE does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this\n        deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the request submission is incomplete unless\n        the DOE provides a justification, by this deadline, for not being able to submit the\n        requested documents and/or information in time. In this case, the deadline shall be\n        extended accordingly.\n233.    The secretariat shall notify the activity participants and the DOE of the conclusion of the\n        substantive check stage. If the request for issuance submission for which the secretariat\n        conducted a substantive check does not meet the requirements of the substantive check,\n        the secretariat shall conclude that the request for issuance submission is incomplete and\n        communicate the underlying reasons to the activity participants and the DOE and make\n        this information available on the UNFCCC website. In this case, the DOE may resubmit\n        the request for issuance with revised documentation. If the resubmission of the request\n        for issuance is made within 28 days of the notification, the secretariat shall promptly re-\n        commence the substantive check; otherwise, the resubmission shall be treated as a new\n        submission of a request for issuance.\n234.    Upon a positive conclusion of the substantive check stage, the secretariat shall publish\n        the request for issuance on the UNFCCC website which shall be deemed received by the\n        Supervisory Body for consideration.\n235.    The secretariat shall notify the activity participants, the DNAs of the host Party(ies) and\n        other participating Parties, and the DOE that the Supervisory Body has received the\n        request for issuance for its consideration, that the secretariat has published the request\n        for issuance on the UNFCCC website, and of the deadline for requesting a review of the\n        request for issuance, as referred to in paragraph 237 below.\n236.    The secretariat shall, subject to guidance from the Supervisory Body, prepare and send\n        to the Supervisory Body a summary note on the request for issuance within 14 days of the\n        date of publication of the request for issuance.\n\n9.1.3. Requesting review of request for issuance\n237.    Any host Party and any other participating Party of the registered A6.4 PoA, and any\n        member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body, may request a review of the\n        request for issuance within 28 days of the date of its publication. If a host Party or other\n\n\n                                                 48 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        participating Party wishes to request a review, its DNA shall submit the request through a\n        dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website. If a member or an alternate member of the\n        Supervisory Body wishes to request a review, they shall submit the request through a\n        dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website.\n238.    The secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of a request for review and promptly notify the\n        Supervisory Body. A request for review shall not be recognized if it is received after 24:00\n        (Central European Time/Central European Summer Time) on the last day of the 28-day\n        period following the publication of the request for issuance.\n239.    A request for review shall provide, inter alia, the reasons for the requested review, based\n        on the activity standard, the validation and verification standard, or any other applicable\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements.\n\n9.1.4. Finalizing request for issuance if there is no request for review\n240.    If the secretariat does not receive a request for review from any host Party, any other\n        participating Party, or any member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body in\n        accordance with the modalities described in section 9.1.3 above, the request for issuance\n        shall be deemed approved by the Supervisory Body.\n241.    Eligible stakeholders, activity participants or Parties may, in accordance with the appeal\n        and grievance procedure, appeal the decision of the Supervisory Body to approve the\n        request for issuance within 14 days of the request having been deemed approved. If no\n        appeal is deemed received from an eligible stakeholder, activity participant or Party within\n        this time frame, the step referred to in paragraph 244 below shall be followed. If an appeal\n        is deemed received from an eligible stakeholder, activity participant or Party within this\n        time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be followed.\n242.    The secretariat shall inform the activity participants of the Supervisory Body’s instructions\n        to the Article 6.4 mechanism registry administrator and update the status of the request\n        for issuance on the UNFCCC website accordingly.\n243.    If the quantity of A6.4ERs to be issued changed from that in the initial request for issuance\n        as a result of the substantive check of the request for issuance, the activity participants or\n        the secretariat shall settle the difference in the issuance fees in accordance with Appendix\n        1. If an additional issuance fee is due, the mechanism registry administrator shall issue\n        the A6.4ERs upon receipt of the additional issuance fee by the secretariat.\n244.    The mechanism registry administrator shall issue the specified quantity of A6.4ERs into\n        the pending account in the mechanism registry, assigning their authorization status, as\n        applicable, in line with the authorization statement on the use of the A6.4ERs provided by\n        the host Party as per paragraph 206 above.\n245.    The mechanism registry administrator shall distribute the A6.4ERs in accordance with the\n        request for distribution of A6.4ERs provided by activity participants in accordance with the\n        “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 49 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n9.2.    Review of request for issuance\n\n9.2.1. Commencement of review\n246.    If any host Party, any other participating Party, or any member or alternate member of the\n        Supervisory Body, requests a review of the request for issuance, the secretariat shall:\n        (a)     Notify the activity participants and the DOE that the request for issuance has been\n                placed under review;\n        (b)     Mark the request for issuance as “under review” on the UNFCCC website and\n                make publicly available an anonymous version of each request for review;\n        (c)     Establish an expert review team comprising two external experts selected from the\n                roster of experts referred to in paragraph 67(c) above to conduct an assessment\n                of the request for review. The secretariat shall appoint one of the team members\n                to serve as the lead, who shall be responsible for all communications with the\n                secretariat and delivery of an assessment report.\n247.    The DOE or the activity participants may request a call from the secretariat to provide\n        clarification on the issues identified, by sending an e-mail to a dedicated e-mail address.\n        Only one such request shall be allowed per review of the request for issuance, regardless\n        of the requesting party. In this case, the DOE or the activity participants shall provide the\n        contact details of the person to be called and the preferred time slots. The secretariat shall\n        schedule the call within three days of receipt of the request and shall record the call.\n248.    The activity participants and the DOE shall provide responses to the issues identified in\n        the request for review within 28 days of receiving the notification that the request for\n        issuance was placed under review.\n249.

The start date of the review shall be when the secretariat notifies the activity participants\n        and the DOE that the review has commenced.\n\n9.2.2. Assessment\n251.    The expert review team established in accordance with paragraph 246(c) above shall\n        conduct an assessment of the request for issuance focusing on the reasons for the request\n        for review provided by the requesting party and the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n        and requirements, taking into account the responses from the activity participants and the\n        DOE. The expert review team shall prepare an assessment report including a proposed\n        decision within 14 days of the start date of the review. A proposed decision shall\n        recommend that either:\n        (a)     The A6.4ERs be issued; or\n\n\n\n                                                 50 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     The request for issuance be rejected.\n252.    If the proposed decision is to reject the request for issuance, the assessment report shall\n        include a proposed ruling with an explanation of the reasons and rationale for the proposed\n        decision, including, but not limited to:\n        (a)     The facts and any interpretation of those facts that formed the basis of the\n                proposed decision;\n        (b)     The Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements applied to the facts;\n        (c)     The interpretation of the Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements as applied\n                to the facts.\n253.    In its assessment report, the expert review team shall highlight any issues of significance\n        related to the policies and goals of the Article 6.4 mechanism arising from the assessment.\n        The secretariat, in consultation with the Chair of the Supervisory Body, shall bring these\n        issues to the attention of the Supervisory Body by preparing background notes and policy\n        options and presenting them to the Supervisory Body at its meetings.\n254.    The expert review team shall submit its assessment report to the Supervisory Body\n        through the secretariat.\n255.    The secretariat shall make the assessment report available to the Supervisory Body,\n        together with any responses from the activity participants and the DOE, and any revision\n        made to the monitoring report, its supporting documentation, verification report and/or\n        certification report.\n\n9.2.3. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n256.    At its meeting, the Supervisory Body shall, taking into account the assessment report\n        prepared by the expert review team and the summary note prepared by the secretariat,\n        decide either to:\n        (a)     Issue the A6.4ERs; or\n        (b)     Reject the request for issuance.\n257.    Eligible stakeholders, activity participants and Parties may, in accordance with the appeal\n        and grievance procedure, appeal to decision of the Supervisory Body within 14 days of\n        the decision. If no appeal is deemed received from an eligible stakeholder, activity\n        participant or Party within this time frame, the process contained in section 9.2.4 below\n        shall be followed. If an appeal is deemed received from an eligible stakeholder, activity\n        participant or Party within this time frame, the appeal and grievance procedure shall be\n        followed.\n\n9.2.4. Finalization and implementation of ruling\n258.    If the Supervisory Body’s final decision made in accordance with paragraph 256 above is\n        to issue A6.4ERs, the mechanism registry administrator shall issue the specified quantity\n        of A6.4ERs.\n259.    The secretariat shall inform the activity participants of the issuance of A6.4ERs into the\n        pending account in the mechanism registry and update the status of the request for\n        issuance on the UNFCCC website accordingly.\n\n\n\n                                                 51 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n260.    If, as a result of the substantive check by the secretariat or the review by the Supervisory\n        Body of the request for issuance, the quantity of A6.4ERs to be issued changed from that\n        in the initial request for issuance, the activity participants or the secretariat shall settle the\n        difference in the issuance fees in accordance with Appendix 1. If an additional issuance\n        fee is due, the mechanism registry administrator shall issue the A6.4ERs provided receipt\n        by the secretariat of the additional issuance fee.\n261.    The mechanism registry administrator shall issue the specified quantity of A6.4ERs into\n        the pending account in the mechanism registry, assigning their authorization status, as\n        applicable, in line with the authorization statement on the use of the A6.4ERs provided by\n        the host Party as per paragraph 206 above.\n262.    The mechanism registry administrator shall distribute the A6.4ERs in accordance with the\n        request for distribution of A6.4ERs provided by activity participants in accordance with the\n        “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry”.\n263.    If the Supervisory Body’s final decision made in accordance with paragraph 256 above is\n        to reject the request for issuance, the secretariat shall update the information on the\n        UNFCCC website accordingly on the first working day following the final decision.\n        Additionally, within 21 days of the final decision, the secretariat shall provide the Chair of\n        the Supervisory Body with an information note containing a proposed ruling incorporating\n        the final decision.\n264.    The proposed ruling shall contain an explanation of the reasons and rationale for the final\n        decision of rejection, including, but not limited to:\n        (a)     The facts and any interpretation of the facts that formed the basis of the proposed\n                ruling;\n        (b)     The Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements applied to the facts;\n        (c)     The interpretation of the Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements as applied\n                to the facts.\n265.    Once approved by the Chair of the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall immediately\n        make the proposed ruling available to the Supervisory Body. The proposed ruling shall\n        become the final ruling of the Supervisory Body 10 days after it was made available to the\n        Supervisory Body, unless a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body objects\n        to it.\n266.    An objection by a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body to the proposed\n        ruling shall be made by notifying the secretariat in writing of the reasons for the objection.\n        The secretariat shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the\n        Supervisory Body.\n267.    If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the proposed ruling more than 14 days\n        prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n        next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise, it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n        following Supervisory Body meeting.\n268.    At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the case is placed on the agenda, the\n        Supervisory Body shall finalize the ruling.\n269.    The secretariat shall publish a ruling note on the UNFCCC website no later than three\n        days after the ruling is finalized.\n\n\n                                                 52 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n270.    If the request for issuance is rejected by the Supervisory Body, any DOE may resubmit\n        the request for issuance with revised documentation, addressing the issues that constitute\n        the reason for the rejection by the Supervisory Body. Upon submission of the revised\n        documentation, the request shall be treated as a new submission of a request for\n        issuance.\n\n9.3.    Withdrawal of request for issuance\n\n9.3.1. Submission of request for withdrawal\n271.    The DOE shall submit a request for withdrawal of a request for issuance to the secretariat\n        through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website for the following cases:\n        (a)     The activity participants wish to voluntarily withdraw the request for issuance;24\n        (b)     The DOE has revised its verification report and/or certification report based on new\n                insights or information.\n\n9.3.2. Processing of request for withdrawal\n272.    Upon receipt of the request for withdrawal of a request for issuance, the secretariat shall\n        check the information provided to it as soon as possible. If the request is complete, and if\n        applicable, the secretariat shall reimburse the issuance fee if applicable in accordance\n        with Appendix 1, and update the information on the activity view page of the relevant\n        registered A6.4 PoA on the UNFCCC website. If the DOE requests the withdrawal after\n        the publication of the request for issuance in accordance with paragraph 234 above, the\n        request for issuance shall be marked as “withdrawn”. The same or a different DOE may\n        resubmit the request for issuance at any time.\n273.    If activity participants wish to change the monitoring period covered by the monitoring\n        report contained in the withdrawn request for issuance, and if the final date of the changed\n        monitoring period is after the DOE conducted an on-site inspection, the same or different\n        DOE shall undertake an additional on-site inspection, or determine if an on-site inspection\n        is necessary to duly perform its verification by following the applicable provisions of the\n        validation and verification standard. Following the verification, the DOE may submit a\n        request for issuance for the changed monitoring period as a new submission.\n\n10. Renewal of programme of activities and component\n    projects\n10.1. General requirements\n274.    A crediting period is defined only at the CP level, for each CP individually. A registered\n        A6.4 PoA, as the framework, is to be renewed every five years (or every 15 years for a\n        PoA involving removals) for a maximum of three times, that is, a maximum of 20 years in\n        total (or 60 years for PoAs involving removals), by updating the PoA-DD in accordance\n        with the activity standard.\n275.    If the host Party has provided an approval of renewal of the PoA period and the renewal\n        of the crediting period of CPs at the time of the registration of the A6.4 PoA in accordance\n\n\n24 In such cases, the DOE shall process the request expeditiously.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 53 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        with paragraph 25(b) above, the PoA period and the crediting periods of CPs may be\n        renewed in accordance with this section.\n276.    Renewal of the PoA period does not require a new approval from the host Party(ies) and\n        new authorization of activity participants from the host Party(ies) or other participating\n        Parties.\n277.    The new PoA period shall start on the day immediately after the expiration of the current\n        PoA period irrespective of the date when the renewal of the PoA period is approved by\n        the Supervisory Body. If the PoA period is deemed renewed after the start of the next PoA\n        period, the activity participants shall not include new CPs or renew the crediting periods\n        of existing CPs from the first day of the next PoA period until the last day before the PoA\n        period is deemed renewed.\n278.    The new crediting period of a CP shall start on the day immediately after the expiration of\n        the current crediting period of the CP irrespective of the date when the renewal of the\n        crediting period of the CP is deemed complete.\n279.    If the date when the renewal of the crediting period of a CP is deemed complete is after\n        the expiration of the current crediting period, and due to this delay or for any other reasons,\n        the monitoring temporarily does not comply with the monitoring plan in the updated CP-\n        DD, the activity participants may opt for a temporary deviation from the registered\n        monitoring plan of the CP in accordance with the process for post-registration changes\n        contained in section 6.5 above.\n\n10.2. Request for renewal of programme of activities period\n\n10.2.1. Update of programme of activities design document\n280.    To renew the PoA period, the activity participants shall update the PoA-DD by preparing\n        a new version in accordance with the activity standard. The activity participants shall\n        ensure that any changes to the list of activity participants in the PoA-DD have been\n        communicated to the secretariat in accordance with section 6.6 above.\n281.    If the new version of the PoA-DD cannot apply the methodologies or methodological tools\n        applied in the registered PoA-DD because the registered A6.4 PoA no longer meets the\n        applicability conditions of the valid version of the methodologies or methodological tools\n        at the time of the submission of the request for renewal of the PoA period, the activity\n        participants shall either select other applicable methodologies or submit a request for\n        clarification, through the DOE, on a deviation from the selected methodologies or\n        methodological tools for the purpose of the renewal of the PoA period in accordance with\n        the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and\n        methodological tools”.\n\n10.2.2. Validation of an updated programme of activities design document\n282.    The activity participants shall submit the new version of the PoA-DD to any DOE\n        accredited in the relevant sectoral scope(s) and contracted by the activity participants to\n        perform the validation for renewal of the PoA period.\n283.    The DOE shall validate whether the updated programme design complies with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard and any other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n        and requirements based on the information provided in the new version of the PoA-DD\n        and any supporting documentation it has received from the activity participants and any\n\n\n                                                 54 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        further information obtained during the validation activity. The DOE shall prepare a\n        validation report, in accordance with the validation and verification standard, using the\n        “Validation report form for renewal of PoAs”.\n284.    For the purpose of potential selection of the validation activity for performance assessment\n        of the DOE in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”, the DOE shall\n        notify the secretariat, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the\n        scheduled site inspection of the A6.4 PoA, which is to be conducted in accordance with\n        the validation and verification standard, no later than four weeks prior to the inspection.\n\n10.2.3.

The secretariat shall issue a statement of the renewal fee due, or confirmation that no\n        renewal fee is due, determined in accordance with the provisions on the renewal fee\n        contained in Appendix 1, and shall communicate it to the DOE.\n301.    The processes for payment of the renewal fee by the activity participants and submission\n        of a proof of payment by the DOE, and the consequence of non-payment of the renewal\n        fee within a deadline, shall follow the corresponding provisions for the registration fee\n        contained in paragraphs 47‒49 above, mutatis mutandis. If the secretariat does not\n        receive the deposit of the renewal fee by the one-year deadline, the crediting period of the\n        CP may no longer be renewed due to the condition referred to in paragraph 303 below.\n302.    The crediting period of the CP will be renewed and displayed on the activity view page of\n        that PoA on the UNFCCC website after the processing of the renewal fee. The secretariat\n        shall automatically notify the DOE, the activity participants and the DNA of the host Party\n        of the renewal of the crediting period of the CP and the change in the status of the PoA.\n        Additionally, the secretariat shall assess the renewals of the crediting periods of the CPs,\n        on a sample basis, in accordance with the process referred to in sections 5.1.2−5.3 above,\n        mutatis mutandis.\n303.

If a submission was made after this deadline, the crediting period of the CP may\n        no longer be renewed. The secretariat shall send a reminder to the activity participants\n        270 days prior to the expiry of the crediting period of the CP, including information on the\n        consequences of missing the deadline.\n304.    Notwithstanding paragraph 303 above, for CPs that transitioned from the CDM to the\n        Article 6.4 mechanism in accordance with the “Procedure for transition of CDM activities\n        to the Article 6.4 mechanism”, if the crediting period ended or will end after 31 December\n        2020, the notifications of renewal of the crediting periods of the CPs shall be submitted\n        within one year of the approval by the Supervisory Body of the transition to the Article 6.4\n        mechanism or within one year of the applicable article 6.4 methodology becomes\n        available, whichever occurs later.\n305.    For the review of an erroneous renewal of crediting period of a CP, the provisions in\n        section 6.2.5 above shall apply, mutatis mutandis.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 57 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n11. Voluntary exclusion of component projects from a\n    registered programme of activities\n11.1. Submission of request for voluntary exclusion\n306.    The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA may submit to the secretariat, through\n        the focal point for scope (c) referred to in paragraph 34 above, a request for voluntary\n        exclusion of an included CP from a registered A6.4 PoA through a dedicated interface on\n        the UNFCCC website, attaching written agreement of all implementers of the CP to the\n        voluntary exclusion using the “Component project voluntary exclusion form”.\n\n11.2. Processing of request for voluntary exclusion\n307.    The secretariat shall, as soon as possible, and in any case striving to do so within five\n        days of receipt of the request for voluntary exclusion of an included CP, conduct a\n        completeness check of the request and attached written no-objections from all\n        implementers of the CP.\n308.    If the secretariat, during the completeness check, identifies missing information, it shall\n        request the activity participants to revise the request and/or submit revised written no-\n        objections, providing the missing information. In this case, the activity participants shall\n        revise the request and/or submit revised written no-objections through the dedicated\n        interface on the UNFCCC website. Upon receipt of the complete request and written no-\n        objections, the secretariat shall resume processing the request.\n309.    Upon conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall notify the activity\n        participants of the conclusion of the completeness check and publish the request for\n        voluntary exclusion on the UNFCCC website. The request for voluntary exclusion shall be\n        deemed received by the Supervisory Body.\n310.    The secretariat shall promptly inform the Supervisory Body of the receipt of the request\n        for voluntary exclusion and mark the CP as “excluded’’ on the UNFCCC website.\n311.    The secretariat shall inform the host Party(ies) and other participating Parties of the PoA\n        of the voluntary exclusion of the CP.\n\n11.3. Effects of voluntary exclusion\n312.    The effective date of exclusion shall be the date when the secretariat received a complete\n        submission of the request for voluntary exclusion.\n313.    A DOE may submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs in accordance with section 9.1.1\n        above for the monitoring report covering the excluded CP for the period prior to the\n        effective date of exclusion.\n314.    A DOE shall not make any request for issuance for the monitoring report that covers the\n        excluded CP for the monitoring period, including any date that is on or after the effective\n        date of exclusion. The mechanism registry administrator shall not issue A6.4ERs for the\n        excluded CP for the period from the effective date of exclusion.\n315.    A CP that has been excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA may be registered as a new\n        A6.4 project under the Article 6.4 mechanism or included in another registered A6.4 PoA,\n        provided that its crediting period is limited to the crediting period under the original PoA.\n\n\n\n                                                 58 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n316.    The CP inclusion fee shall not be reimbursed for an excluded CP.\n\n12. Withdrawal of approval of a programme of activities or\n    authorization of activity participant\n12.1. Withdrawal of approval of project or authorized activity participant\n\n12.1.1. Submission of withdrawal notification\n317.    A host Party of a proposed or registered A6.4 PoA may, through its DNA, submit a\n        notification to the secretariat to withdraw approval of the PoA or the authorization of any\n        of the activity participants, made in accordance with paragraphs 24‒25 above, at any time\n        through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the following\n        information:\n        (a)     The PoA title and its unique UNFCCC reference number;\n        (b)     The type of withdrawal (either withdrawal of approval of the PoA or withdrawal of\n                authorization of activity participants);\n        (c)     The names of the activity participants to whom the withdrawal of authorization\n                applies (if the withdrawal only relates to the authorization of activity participants);\n        (d)     The effective date of the withdrawal, which shall be at least 60 days after the date\n                of the notification of the withdrawal unless the host Party specifies an earlier date\n                with justification;\n        (e)     The reason(s) for the withdrawal.\n318.    Other participating Parties may withdraw the authorization of the activity participants made\n        in accordance with paragraph 28 above, through their DNAs, at any time through the\n        dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, providing the information listed in\n        paragraph 317(a)−(e) above.\n319.    Upon receipt of the withdrawal notification, the secretariat shall promptly inform the\n        affected activity participants of the notification and check whether the information provided\n        is complete. If found incomplete, the secretariat shall request the DNAs of the Parties\n        submitting the withdrawal to provide the missing information.\n320.    The secretariat shall publish the withdrawal of the approval of the PoA and/or the\n        authorization of activity participants on the UNFCCC website on the effective date of the\n        withdrawal.\n321.    If any of the host Parties withdraws the approval of the PoA:\n        (a)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is before the DOE submits a request for\n                registration of the PoA in accordance with paragraph 43 above, such a request\n                may not be submitted;\n        (b)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the DOE has submitted a request for\n                registration of the PoA but before the final decision of the Supervisory Body on the\n                request, the request shall not be processed;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 59 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     If the effective date of the withdrawal is after the final decision of the Supervisory\n                Body to register the PoA, the provisions outlined in paragraph 322 below shall\n                apply.\n\n12.1.2. Impact of withdrawal of approval of PoA or authorized activity participant\n322.    For a registered A6.4 PoA from which any of the host Parties withdrew its approval,\n        requests for issuance for GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the\n        PoA before the effective date of the withdrawal may still be submitted until the deadline\n        specified in paragraph 221 above. Consequently, the A6.4ERs may be issued in\n        accordance with sections 7 and 9 above. In this case, requests for issuance shall not cover\n        a monitoring period from the effective date of the withdrawal of the approval of the PoA.\n323.    For a registered A6.4 PoA from which the host Parties or other participating Parties only\n        withdrew the authorization of one or more activity participants, requests for issuance for\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the PoA may still be\n        submitted until the deadline specified in paragraph 221 above. Consequently, the\n        A6.4ERs may be issued in accordance with sections 7 and 9 above, as long as one activity\n        participant authorized by the host Party remains. For the purpose of requests for issuance\n        and distribution of A6.4ERs, the activity participants whose authorization was withdrawn\n        shall be treated as if they were still activity participants of the PoA for the monitoring period\n        prior to the effective date of the withdrawal of the authorization.\n\n13. Appeals and grievances\n324.    Stakeholders, the activity participants, the host Party(ies) and other participating Parties,\n        through their DNAs, may appeal decisions of the Supervisory Body in accordance with\n        paragraphs 65, 78, 241 and 257 above or request that a grievance be addressed, in\n        accordance with the “Procedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 60 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-AC-003\nProcedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. Fee schedule\n\n1.     Background\n1.      This Appendix outlines the fee rates payable by the activity participants of a proposed or\n        registered programmes of activities (PoAs) under the mechanism established by Article 6,\n        paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism). These fees are intended to\n        cover the administrative expenses for processing requests submitted at various stages of\n        the Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle. This Appendix also details the rules of\n        reimbursement of paid fees where the requests are withdrawn by the submitting\n        designated operations entities (DOEs), concluded as incomplete by the secretariat, or\n        rejected by the Supervisory Body.\n2.      The fee types and rates are set based on decisions made by the Conference of the Parties\n        serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) relating to the share\n        of proceeds to cover administrative expenses as outlined in decision 3/CMA3, annex,\n        paragraphs 48, and chapter VII, and as elaborated in decision 7/CMA.4, annex I,\n        chapter V.\n\n2.     General\n3.      In accordance with the relevant sections of this procedure, fees outlined in this\n        Appendix shall be paid at the time of submission of the respective requests. The initiation\n        of processing of a request shall be subject to the payment of the fee.\n4.      All fees referred to in this Appendix shall be waived for PoAs and component projects\n        (CPs) therein hosted in the least developed countries and small island developing States\n        or for multi-country PoAs where at least one of the host Parties is a least developed\n        country or a small island developing State.\n5.      The Supervisory Body may adjust and implement the fee structure and levels within the\n        boundary set by the CMA in its decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapter V, based on the guiding\n        principles of balancing income and expenditure, enabling long-term sound operation of\n        the Article 6.4 mechanism, being fair to activity participants, ensuring administrative\n        efficiency and providing predictability to activity participants and the Supervisory Body.\n\n3.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4).1 In accordance with the RMPs, a proposed or registered Article 6.4 activity\n          (A6.4 activity) as well as monitored greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or net\n          GHG removals achieved by an A6.4 activity shall be independently assessed by a\n          designated operational entity (DOE) against the requirement set out in the RMPs in order\n          for the activity to be registered or renewed under the Article 6.4, or Article 6, paragraph 4\n          emission reductions to be issued.2\n2.        Pursuant to the RMPs, the Supervisory Body is responsible for the accreditation of\n          operational entities as DOEs and the establishment of the requirements and process\n          necessary to operate the accreditation.3 The CMA, at its third session, requested the\n          Supervisory Body to review the accreditation standards and procedures of the clean\n          development mechanism (CDM) with a view to applying them with revisions, as\n          appropriate, for the Article 6.4 by the end of 2023, and expeditiously accredit operational\n          entities as DOEs.4\n\n1.2.      Objectives\n3.        The objective of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation” (hereinafter referred to as this\n          procedure) is to set forth concise and transparent rules for the process of the accreditation\n          of operational entities5 under the Article 6.4.\n\n2.        Scope\n2.1.      Scope and applicability\n4.        This procedure sets out the process to operationalize the accreditation of operational\n          entities.\n5.        This procedure contains the series of rules and actions that shall be followed and/or\n          undertaken by applicant entities (AEs) and DOEs to obtain or maintain accreditation, as\n          well as by the Supervisory Body and its support structure to conduct accreditation\n          assessments of whether AEs/DOEs comply with the Article 6.4 accreditation\n          requirements.6\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. Available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25.\n2    RMPs, paragraphs 46, 51 and 57.\n3    RMPs, paragraphs 24(a)(i) and 24(b).\n4    Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(d)‒(e).\n5    In this procedure document, as in the standard document, the term “operational entity” includes both\n     applicant entity (AE) and designated operational entity (DOE).\n6    The term “Article 6.4 accreditation requirements” is defined in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”.\n\n\n\n                                                     5 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n2.2.    Entry into force\n6.      Version 01.0 of this procedure is effective as of 31 March 2024.\n\n3.      Normative reference\n7.      The following documents are indispensable for the application of this procedure:\n        (a)     “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”;\n        (b)     “Procedure on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”;\n        (c)     “Procedure for selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4\n                accreditation roster of experts”;\n        (d)     “Forms used in the Article 6.4 accreditation procedure”.\n\n4.      Definitions\n8.      In addition to the definitions contained in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”, the\n        following terms apply in this procedure:\n        (a)     “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;\n        (b)     “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action\n                is recommended as particularly suitable;\n        (c)     “May” is used to indicate what is permitted.\n\n5.      Basics of the Article 6.4 accreditation process\n5.1.    Actors in the Article 6.4 accreditation process and main functions\n9.      There are several actors involved in the Article 6.4 accreditation process, and the\n        responsibility of each is as follows:\n        (a)     The Supervisory Body takes decisions on whether to:\n                (i)     Accredit AEs as DOEs, maintain the accreditation of DOEs and reaccredit\n                        DOEs;\n                (ii)    Conduct spot-checks of DOEs;\n                (iii)   Place DOEs “under observation”;\n                (iv)    Suspend the accreditation of DOEs for some or all sectoral scopes;\n                (v)     Withdraw the accreditation of DOEs for some or all sectoral scopes.\n        (b)     The Article 6.4 Accreditation Expert Panel (AEP) serves as the technical panel\n                under the guidance of the Supervisory Body and, in accordance with its terms of\n                reference, considers the results of accreditation assessments of AEs/DOEs by\n                Article 6.4 assessment teams, provides recommendations to the Supervisory Body\n                on the accreditation status of, or related actions for, AEs/DOEs, and makes\n                decisions on areas defined as per this procedure. The AEP may consider cases\n                electronically or at its meetings;\n\n\n\n                                                6 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n         (c)      Article 6.4 assessment teams (ATs) conduct accreditation assessments of\n                  AEs/DOEs in accordance with this procedure, the “Article 6.4 accreditation\n                  standard” and under the guidance of the AEP, to evaluate whether AEs/DOEs\n                  comply with the Article 6.4 accreditation requirements and submit assessment\n                  reports to the AEP. ATs are selected from the accreditation roster of experts which\n                  contain both external experts and secretariat staff;\n         (d)      The secretariat supports the implementation of this procedure;\n         (e)      AEs/DOEs apply for accreditation, extension of accreditation for additional sectoral\n                  scopes and/or reaccreditation and undergo accreditation assessments to\n                  demonstrate compliance with Article 6.4 accreditation requirements.\n\n5.2.     Scope and status of accreditation\n10.      The Article 6.4 accreditation is based on the validation and verification/certification\n         functions as well as on sectoral scopes of accreditation.7 An AE may apply for\n         accreditation for both validation and verification/certification functions in one or more\n         sectoral scopes.\n11.      The accreditation of a DOE is valid for five years from the date of the accreditation decision\n         by the Supervisory Body.\n12.      Accreditation is granted to an entity registered under applicable national laws,8 irrespective\n         of whether the entire organization or a part of it performs validation and/or\n         verification/certification functions.\n13.      Accreditation is granted for both validation and verification/certification functions together,\n         in one or more sectoral scopes. Likewise, if accreditation is suspended or withdrawn, it is\n         done so for both validation and verification/certification functions together, in one or more\n         sectoral scopes.\n\n5.3.     Objective and scope of accreditation assessments\n14.      The objective of an accreditation assessment of an AE/DOE is to assess and determine\n         whether the AE/DOE complies with Article 6.4 accreditation requirements.\n15.      If the validation and/or verification/certification functions are performed by a part of an\n         AE/DOE, and other parts of the AE/DOE are involved in other activities, these other\n         activities may be assessed as they may affect validation and/or verification/certification\n         activities, in particular with regard to independence and impartiality.\n\n5.4.     General modalities of accreditation assessments\n16.      The assessment of an AE for initial accreditation and of a DOE for reaccreditation\n         consists of the following main elements:\n         (a)      Desk review of the application documentation submitted by the AE/DOE with a\n                  view to identifying all missing or unclear information and having the AE/DOE gather\n                  all necessary information and documentation, as a preparation for the on-site\n                  assessment;\n\n7   Sectoral scopes of accreditation are defined in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”.\n8   Please refer to section 6 of the Article 6.4 accreditation standard for more details.\n\n\n\n                                                     7 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (b)     On-site assessment to assess whether the documented systems of the AE/DOE,\n                and its competence and operational capability to perform validation and/or\n                verification/certification functions comply with the Article 6.4 accreditation\n                requirements. An on-site assessment shall take place at the central office of the\n                AE/DOE and may also take place at any other offices of the AE/DOE or outsourced\n                entities where the validation and/or verification/certification functions of the\n                AE/DOE are performed. For reaccreditation, the selection of these other offices will\n                be based on the results of previous assessments (regular on-site surveillances and\n                performance assessments) and the results of the implementation of the “Procedure\n                on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”.\n17.     If, after completion of an on-site assessment, the AE/DOE has demonstrated compliance\n        with all Article 6.4 accreditation requirements, accreditation or reaccreditation shall be\n        granted to the AE or the DOE, respectively, for both validation and verification/certification\n        functions and in the sectoral scopes in which the AE/DOE has demonstrated its\n        competence to perform its validation and verification/certification functions.\n18.     After the Supervisory Body has granted accreditation or reaccreditation, the DOE is\n        allowed to perform its validation and verification/certification functions in the accredited\n        sectoral scopes.\n19.     A DOE shall be subject to performance assessments during its accredited term. The\n        purpose of a performance assessment is to assess the implementation of the systems of\n        the DOE and its competence in an accredited sectoral scope through an assessment of a\n        specific validation or verification/certification activity. The number and types of\n        performance assessments for a DOE are set out in section 7.1 below.\n20.     A DOE shall be subject to two regular on-site surveillances, as referred to in section 8\n        below, during its accreditation term. The purpose of a regular on-site surveillance is to\n        verify whether the systems, competence and operational capability of the DOE continue\n        to meet Article 6.4 accreditation requirements over the accreditation term. A routine on-\n        site surveillance should take place at the central office of the DOE and may also include\n        any other offices of the DOE or its outsourced entities where the validation and/or\n        verification/certification functions of the DOE are performed.\n21.     The Supervisory Body may decide to conduct a spot-check of a DOE at any time during\n        the accreditation term of the DOE. In addition, the AEP may initiate a spot-check of a DOE\n        in accordance with the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational\n        entities”. The purpose of a spot-check is to assess whether a DOE still meets one or more\n        specific Article 6.4 accreditation requirements because of a specific concern brought up\n        to the Supervisory Body regarding the compliance of the DOE with Article 6.4 accreditation\n        requirements or because of inadequate performance of the DOE monitored through the\n        “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational entities”. A spot-check\n        may include a desk review, and/or an on-site assessment at any office of the DOE and\n        outsourced entities where the validation and/or verification/certification functions of the\n        DOE are performed, and/or an assessment at the site of the Article 6.4 project (A6.4\n        project) or programme of activities (A6.4 PoA) being validated or verified/certified.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n22.      For the planning of an assessment, the risk associated with the activities, locations and\n         personnel covered by the scope of accreditation shall be taken into account while\n         implementing the following provisions:9\n         (a)      Selection of the number and types of offices, outsourced entities and validation\n                  and verification/certification activity of the AE/DOE to be assessed during the\n                  initiation stage of the assessment;\n         (b)      Planning of activities to be assessed by ATs.\n23.      For the conduct of assessment, the standard person-days and the number of AT members\n         participating in the assessment are provided in Appendix 9 to this procedure, and the\n         standard on-site assessment method to be used by an AT to conduct on-site assessment.\n         Under special circumstances the secretariat may propose to deviate from the standard\n         assessment modalities, based on the risk associated with activities, locations and\n         personnel covered by the scope of accreditation, including:\n         (a)      The number of experts on the assessment team, with a possibility to have a one-\n                  person team;\n         (b)      The number of days to be spent by the team on-site, with a possibility to have a\n                  one-day assessment;\n         (c)      The format of the assessment, with a possibility to have some or all of the\n                  assessors working remotely through, for example, videoconferencing;\n         (d)      The sites to be included in the assessment, with a possibility to visit only the non-\n                  central offices during the regular surveillance assessment.\n24.      In the event of the deviation, as referred in paragraph 23 above, the time between\n         consecutive on-site assessments shall not exceed two years. Also, deviation shall not be\n         exercised for performance assessment as referred to in section 7 below.\n25.      If a significant number (e.g. more than 10) of non-conformities (NCs) are raised by the AT\n         in either the initial accreditation assessment, performance assessment, regular on-site\n         surveillance assessment, reaccreditation assessment or extension of accreditation for\n         additional sectoral scopes assessment, an additional five days may be allocated by the\n         secretariat to the time frames required for the AE/DOE and the AT, respectively, to\n         complete the required actions referred to in this procedure.10\n26.      Where accreditation assessments are conducted simultaneously, the following modalities\n         apply:\n         (a)      If a regular on-site surveillance or the reaccreditation process is initiated while a\n                  performance assessment is still underway, the outcomes of the performance\n                  assessment should be taken into account in preparing the workplan for the regular\n                  on-site surveillance or the reaccreditation process;\n         (b)      The outcomes of all performance assessments, regular on-site surveillances and\n                  any other accreditation assessments in the current accreditation term should be\n                  taken into account in preparing the workplan for the reaccreditation process;\n\n9   Please refer to section 4.3 of the Article 6.4 accreditation standard on the risks associated with validation\n    and verification/certification conducted by a DOE.\n10 In this procedure, the number of days is to be considered as calendar days, unless specified otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     9 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (c)     If a spot-check is initiated while a regular on-site surveillance or reaccreditation\n                process is underway or will start shortly, the regular on-site surveillance or\n                reaccreditation process should specify the issues that triggered the spot-check,\n                where possible.\n27.     Where there is evidence identified by the AT that a DOE intentionally provided false\n        information, intentionally omitted information that should have been provided, or\n        deliberately violated any accreditation requirement,11 the AT shall promptly submit a draft\n        assessment report to the AEP. In this case, the following steps shall follow:\n        (a)     The AEP shall consider the case and decide whether to recommend that the\n                Supervisory Body suspend or withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, based on the\n                criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure. At this stage, the AEP may\n                request the DOE to provide information relating to the alleged conduct;\n        (b)     If the AEP recommends that the Supervisory Body suspend or withdraw the\n                accreditation of the DOE, the secretariat shall inform the DOE of the\n                recommendation of the AEP. The DOE may request an independent review of the\n                AEP recommendation in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 5\n                to this procedure, and/or request a hearing before the Supervisory Body in\n                accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to this procedure. In these\n                cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in\n                accordance with paragraph 27(d) below shall take place only after the Supervisory\n                Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to this\n                procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken\n                place, as applicable;\n        (c)     If the AEP decides not to recommend that the Supervisory Body suspend or\n                withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, the AT shall resume the accreditation\n                assessment;\n        (d)     The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP, together\n                with the independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable,\n                and decide whether to suspend or withdraw the accreditation of the DOE in\n                accordance with provisions in section 13 or 14 below, respectively, and based on\n                the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure;\n        (e)     If the Supervisory Body decides not to suspend or withdraw the accreditation of\n                the DOE, the AT shall resume the accreditation assessment.\n28.     Under exceptional circumstances, while considering the assessments conducted under\n        the sections 6–17 below, the AEP may recommend to the Supervisory Body supported by\n        proper justification that the Supervisory Body:\n        (a)     Conduct an on-site assessment to verify the implementation of corrective actions,\n                including the modalities of such assessment (e.g. AT members, time frame);\n        (b)     Submit any appropriate recommendation. The Supervisory Body shall consider\n                such a recommendation at its next meeting and decide on the course of action.\n\n\n\n11 The terms “intentionally” and “deliberately” mean active or passive omission or violation, which cover the\n\n  situations of through an act or through failure to act, through active intent or though gross negligence or\n  negligent disregard.\n\n\n\n                                                  10 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n29.     The AEP may submit any appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory Body for failure\n        of a DOE to meet deadlines specified in the regulations and decisions of the Supervisory\n        Body or the AEP. Such recommendation shall be supported by a proper justification. The\n        Supervisory Body shall consider such recommendation at its next meeting and decide on\n        the course of action, including authorizing deviation from this procedure.\n30.     If the AT identifies any findings during an assessment, these findings shall be classified\n        NCs or major NCs. Any finding is an NC if it is a non-fulfilment of an accreditation\n        requirement of the Article 6.4. If a finding is not an NC, opportunities for improvement may\n        be raised by the AT and recorded in the final assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n        013). A major NC is an NC that affects the capability of the management system to achieve\n        the intended results, which may cover the following circumstances and trigger the\n        suspension or withdrawal as specified in Appendix 3 below:12\n        (a)     If there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that\n                products or services will meet specified requirements;\n        (b)     A number of NCs associated with the same requirement or issue could\n                demonstrate a systemic failure and thus constitute a major NC.\n31.     If the AT identifies a major NC, the AT shall promptly submit a draft assessment report to\n        the AEP. In this case, the AEP shall consider the case and decide whether to recommend\n        that the Supervisory Body place the DOE under observation or suspend the accreditation\n        of the DOE, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure.\n32.     Appendix 5 and Appendix 7 to this procedure provide AEs/DOEs with mechanisms to\n        request a review of AEP recommendations and AT raising NCs, respectively.\n33.     All documentation provided by an AE/DOE for an accreditation assessment shall be in\n        English.\n34.     The language to be used in any accreditation assessment shall be English. AEs/DOEs\n        may use interpretation/translation services where necessary to ensure effective\n        communication with ATs.\n\n6.      Initial accreditation\n6.1.    General\n35.     The process for initial accreditation comprises the following steps:\n        (a)     Submission of an application for accreditation by an entity;\n        (b)     Completeness check of the application documentation by the secretariat;\n        (c)     Preparation of a workplan and appointment of an AT by the secretariat;\n        (d)     Desk review by the AT of the documentation provided by the AE;\n        (e)     On-site assessment by the AT at the central office of the AE and, as applicable, at\n                any other offices of the AE or outsourced entities where the AE validation and/or\n                verification/certification functions are to be performed;\n\n\n12 ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (f)     Recommendation by the AEP to the Supervisory Body for accreditation or rejection\n                of application;\n        (g)     Decision by the Supervisory Body for accreditation or rejection of application.\n\n6.2.    Application for accreditation\n36.     An entity that wishes to be accredited and designated as a DOE shall submit to the\n        secretariat a duly completed application form (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-001), a declaration\n        of all other offices of the entity or outsourced entities where the entity’s validation and\n        verification/certification functions are to be performed (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-002), and\n        all other documents specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure, and pay the application fee\n        specified in Appendix 9 to this procedure.\n37.     The application of an AE for accreditation shall be considered duly submitted when the\n        secretariat has received both the application documentation and the application fee.\n38.     The AE may voluntarily withdraw its application for accreditation by submitting a written\n        notification of withdrawal any time before the meeting of the Supervisory Body at which a\n        decision on the accreditation is due to be made in accordance with paragraph 79 below.\n\n6.3.    Completeness check\n39.     The secretariat shall start processing the application once it is considered duly submitted\n        in accordance with paragraph 37 above.\n40.     The secretariat shall undertake a completeness check of the application documentation.\n        If the documentation is found incomplete, the secretariat shall inform the AE of the missing\n        elements within seven days of the application being considered duly submitted.\n        Subsequent steps of the process shall only continue once all requested documentation\n        has been received by the secretariat.\n41.     The secretariat shall publish the name of the AE and the sectoral scopes applied for by\n        the AE on the UNFCCC Article 6.4 website for global stakeholder consultation promptly\n        after receiving all required documents from the AE. Parties, stakeholders13 and\n        UNFCCC-accredited observer organizations shall have 30 days to provide any comments\n        or information in respect of the AE to the secretariat through a dedicated interface on the\n        UNFCCC Article 6.4 website (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-025).\n\n6.4.    Appointment of the AT and preparation of workplan\n42.     The secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents from the AE,\n        appoint an AT for the assessment, selecting its members from the roster of experts\n        established for the purpose of accreditation assessments (hereinafter referred to as the\n        Accreditation Roster of Experts) in accordance with relevant terms of references. The AT\n        shall consist of at least two members, including a team leader. The size of the AT may\n        vary depending on the size of the AE and the expected volume of validation and\n        verification/certification activities to be performed by the AE, the application\n        documentation and the sectoral scopes of accreditation applied for.\n\n\n\n\n13 For the purpose of this procedure, all members of the public are considered to be stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n43.     The secretariat shall inform the AE of the composition of the AT. The AE may object, in\n        writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of\n        conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest.\n44.     If the AE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall, within five days\n        of receipt of the objection, consider modifying the composition of the AT. If the secretariat\n        considers the objection unjustified, or the AE does not object to the selection of any AT\n        member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 43 above, the composition of the\n        AT shall be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and\n        replaces a AT member, it shall inform the AE of the new AT member within the same five\n        days. After this, the same steps in paragraphs 43 and 44 above shall repeat until the\n        composition of the AT is deemed accepted.\n45.     Once the composition of the AT is deemed accepted, each AT member shall sign a\n        confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n        004).\n46.     The secretariat shall, within five days of the end of the global stakeholder consultation,\n        prepare a workplan (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-007) for the assessment, based on the\n        application documentation and the comments and information received during the global\n        stakeholder consultation in accordance with paragraph 41 above, and submit it to the AEP\n        for comments. The workplan shall identify whether additional assessments shall be\n        performed at offices other than the AE central office. The AEP may provide comments on\n        the workplan within five days of receipt of the workplan. The secretariat shall finalize the\n        workplan within five days of the deadline for commenting by the AEP.\n47.     The secretariat shall provide the AT with:\n        (a)     All information related to the application, including the application documentation;\n        (b)     The workplan for the assessment.\n\n6.5.    Assessment by the AT\n\n6.5.1. Desk review\n48.     The AT shall undertake the desk review of the application documentation.\n49.     If the AT considers the information contained in the application documentation sufficient\n        and adequate for the assessment, it shall prepare and finalize a desk review report (form\n        A6.4-FORM-ACCR-008) and send it to the AE within 15 days of receipt of the documents\n        referred to in paragraph 47 above, and proceed with the on-site assessment in accordance\n        with paragraph 53 below. The AT shall not raise any NC at the stage of desk review.\n50.     If the AT considers that there is missing, unclear and/or inadequate information in the\n        application documentation, the AT shall prepare a draft desk review report and send it to\n        the AE within 15 days of receipt of the documents referred to in paragraph 47 above, and\n        request the AE to provide additional and/or amended documentation.\n51.     The AE shall provide the requested additional and/or amended documentation within\n        20 days of receipt of the draft desk review report.\n52.     No later than 30 days after sending the draft desk review report to the AE, the AT shall\n        prepare a final desk review report. If the AT, at the first round of the desk review stage,\n        considers the additional and/or amended documentation adequate, or the additional\n\n\n\n                                              13 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        and/or amended documentation inadequate, or there are still missing documents but they\n        can be assessed during the on-site assessment, the AT shall send it to the AE and\n        proceed with the on-site assessment in accordance with paragraph 53 below. If the AT, at\n        the second round of the deck review stage, considers that the additional and/or amended\n        documentation is not adequate or there are still missing documents and they need to be\n        addressed or submitted prior to the on-site assessment, the AT shall submit a final desk\n        review report to the AEP requesting to consider allowing the AT to conduct an additional\n        round of desk review for the AEP’s consideration at its next meeting.\n\n6.5.2. On-site assessment\n53.     After the desk review, the AT shall conduct an on-site assessment covering all offices\n        identified in the workplan. If there is more than one office assessed, all office assessments\n        shall be compiled into one reporting, and the final decision on accreditation shall be made\n        based on the outcomes of all offices assessed.\n54.     The AT leader, taking into account the availability of the AT members and the AE and with\n        support from the secretariat, shall coordinate the dates and logistics for the on-site\n        assessment. The visit to the central office shall be conducted within 60 days of receipt of\n        the final desk review report by the AE. The visits to other offices or outsourced entities, if\n        any, shall be conducted after the visit to the central office as per the workplan.\n55.     If the AE is not available for the AT visit to the central office within the time frame referred\n        to in paragraph 54 above, the secretariat shall request the AE to reconfirm its interest in\n        proceeding with the application for accreditation and seek justification in writing or by email\n        for the delay, and the AE shall reply to the secretariat within seven days of its receipt. The\n        secretariat shall present the case to the AEP for its decision on whether to allow the delay\n        or recommend that the Supervisory Body reject the application.\n56.     The AT shall conduct the assessment at each office identified in the workplan. If the AT\n        identifies any NC, it shall prepare a non-conformity report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-012)\n        for each NC during the office visit. The AT shall provide the AE with objective evidence for\n        each NC raised. The AE shall have an opportunity to seek clarification from, and ask\n        questions of the AT on the NCs raised.\n57.     The AE shall provide a written acceptance of any NCs that it agrees with during the AT\n        office visit.\n58.     If the AE disagrees with any NCs raised by the AT, the AE may request a review of the\n        NCs by the AEP in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this\n        procedure. All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in this\n        section up to the step immediately before the preparation of a (draft) final assessment\n        report. For the NCs placed under review, if the AEP decides to maintain them in\n        accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be\n        addressed as per the provisions in this section and the AT shall prepare a (draft) final\n        assessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with\n        the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft)\n        final assessment report excluding the dropped NCs.\n59.     The AT shall prepare an on-site assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-011) and\n        make it available to the AE with non-conformity reports, as applicable, for information,\n        within 15 days of the completion of the visits to all the offices as per the workplan.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n60.     If the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form\n        A6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the AE for comments at the same time\n        as the on-site assessment report. The AE shall have five days to provide comments on\n        the draft final assessment report. The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking\n        under consideration the comments of the AE, make it available to the AE for information,\n        and submit it together with the on-site assessment report to the AEP within five days of\n        the deadline for commenting by the AE. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance\n        with section 6.6 below.\n61.     If the AT has identified one or more NCs, the AE shall conduct a root-cause analysis, and\n        propose corrective actions for each agreed NC, including a time frame for implementation,\n        within 15 days of receipt of the on-site assessment report.\n62.     The AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis\n        and communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the AE within five days of receipt\n        of them.\n63.     If the AE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the\n        deadline referred to in paragraph 61 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report,\n        make it available to the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-\n        site assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The\n        AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 6.6 below.\n64.     If the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the AE with\n        explanations to such rejection. The AE shall have an additional seven days to propose\n        revised corrective actions.\n65.     The AT shall assess the revised proposed corrective actions within five days of their\n        receipt.\n66.     If the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the AE does not\n        propose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 64 above, the\n        AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to the AE for information,\n        and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity\n        reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance\n        with section 6.6 below.\n67.     If the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by\n        the AT, the AE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their\n        implementation to the AT within 60 days of their acceptance by the AT.\n68.     The AT shall assess the implementation of all the corrective actions within 10 days of\n        receipt of the evidence of implementation.\n69.     If the AE does not submit evidence of implementation by the deadline referred to in\n        paragraph 67 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to\n        the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment\n        report and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall\n        consider the case in accordance with section 6.6 below.\n70.     If the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the\n        implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft\n        final assessment report and make it available to the AE for comments within seven days\n        of the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions.\n\n\n\n\n                                              15 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n71.     If the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the AE shall\n        have an additional 30 days to pursue implementation of the corrective actions and submit\n        further evidence to the AT.\n72.     The AT shall assess the further implementation of the corrective actions within 10 days of\n        receipt of the further evidence. Regardless of whether the AT still considers the\n        implementation of corrective actions unsatisfactory, or whether the AE has submitted\n        adequate further evidence of implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall\n        prepare a draft final assessment report and make it available to the AE for comments\n        within seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further implementation of\n        the corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further evidence, as applicable.\n73.     The AE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made\n        available to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the\n        AE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the\n        NCs.\n74.     The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments\n        provided by the AE, make it available to the AE for information, and submit it to the AEP\n        together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within five days of\n        the deadline for commenting by the AE.\n\n6.6.    Consideration by the AEP\n75.     The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or\n        more NCs remain open, it may provide one final opportunity to the AE to resolve the\n        remaining NCs in accordance with relevant provisions in the previous section of this\n        procedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment.\n76.     If the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it\n        shall recommend that the Supervisory Body accredit the AE for all sectoral scopes applied\n        for.\n77.     If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 75 above, as\n        applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend to the\n        Supervisory Body one of the following options:\n        (a)     Accredit the AE only for some sectoral scopes applied for;\n        (b)     Reject the application for accreditation.\n78.     The secretariat shall inform the AE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP\n        recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 77(a) and (b) above, the\n        AE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with\n        the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. In this case, the consideration\n        by the Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in accordance with paragraph 79\n        below shall take place only after the Supervisory Body has received the independent\n        review report referred to in Appendix 5 to this procedure and decided on the review case.\n\n6.7.    Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n79.     The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the\n        independent review report, as applicable, and decide on one of the following options:\n        (a)     Accredit the AE for all sectoral scopes applied for;\n\n\n\n                                               16 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (b)     Accredit the AE for some sectoral scopes applied for;\n        (c)     Reject the application for accreditation.\n80.     If the Supervisory Body decides to accredit the AE for some or all sectoral scopes applied\n        for, the secretary of the Supervisory Body shall issue an accreditation certificate to the AE.\n81.     The secretariat shall maintain a public list of DOEs on the UNFCCC Article 6.4 website,\n        containing information on:\n        (a)     Their accredited sectoral scopes;\n        (b)     Contact details and addresses of the central office and any other offices of the\n                entity as well as those of the outsourced entities where the validation and\n                verification/certification functions are performed;\n        (c)     A summary of the requests for registration and issuance submitted per DOE.\n\n7.      Performance assessment\n7.1.    General\n\n82.     The number and types of performance assessments for planning purposes should be\n        determined as follows:\n        (a)     A minimum of three performance assessments, reasonably spaced along with the\n                regular surveillances, in the five-year accreditation term for any DOE as the\n                mandatory basis;14\n        (b)     Additional performance assessment(s) based on the volume of work as follows:\n                (i)    One additional performance assessment on a validation activity per year if\n                       the DOE submitted 50 or more requests for registration in the previous\n                       12 months;\n                (ii)   One additional performance assessment on a verification activity per year if\n                       the DOE submitted 150 or more requests for issuance in the previous\n                       12 months;\n        (c)     Addition or reduction of the number of performance assessments based on the\n                output of the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational\n                entities” by:\n                (i)    One additional performance assessment on a validation or\n                       verification/certification activity if the indicator I2 is in the yellow zone for the\n                       registration or issuance process, respectively, for three consecutive\n                       monitoring periods;\n                (ii)   One less performance assessment on a validation or verification/certification\n                       activity if the indicator I2 is in the green zone for the registration or issuance\n                       process, respectively, for four consecutive monitoring periods. This reduction\n\n\n\n14 The total number of performance assessments may increase to one performance assessment per year\n\n  within the five-year accreditation term based on the risk-based approach analysis.\n\n\n\n                                                 17 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n                      in the number of performance assessments shall be effected only from those\n                      added in accordance with paragraph 82(b) above.\n83.     The launching of performance assessments is subject to a DOE notifying the secretariat,\n        through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website, of the timing of the site inspection\n        of the proposed A6.4 activity related to requests for registration or renewal or requests for\n        issuance, as per the provisions related to such notification as defined under “Procedure:\n        Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects” and “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle\n        procedure for programme of activities”.\n84.     The DOE shall make at least one submission of a request for registration, renewal or\n        issuance under the Article 6.4 activity cycle within the five-year accreditation term to\n        ensure the implementation of the established quality management system of the 6.4 DOE\n        and its competence; otherwise, the DOE’s reaccreditation shall be rejected as highlighted\n        under paragraph 175(c) below.\n\n7.2.    Initiation\n85.     The secretariat shall select validation and verification/certification activities for\n        performance assessments to be conducted for a DOE based on the notification of site\n        inspection by the DOE for requests for registration or renewal or requests for issuance, as\n        highlighted under paragraph 83 above.\n86.     The secretariat shall notify the DOE of the validation or verification/certification activity\n        selected for a performance assessment. The DOE shall submit to the secretariat the\n        documentation for the assessment specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure within five\n        days of receipt of the notification.\n\n7.3.    Completeness check\n87.     The secretariat shall undertake a completeness check of the documentation for the\n        assessment. If any of the required documents are not received by the secretariat by the\n        deadline referred to in paragraph 86 above, the secretariat shall send a reminder to the\n        DOE within seven days of the deadline. If any of the required documents are still not\n        received by the secretariat within seven days of sending the reminder, the secretariat shall\n        report the case to the AEP, and the AEP shall make a recommendation to the Supervisory\n        Body to place the DOE under observation.\n\n7.4.    Appointment of the AT\n88.     The secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents, including the\n        confirmation of the on-site inspection date from the DOE, appoint an AT for the\n        assessment, selecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts. The AT shall\n        consist of a team leader and an expert qualified in the sectoral scopes of the A6.4 project\n        or A6.4 PoA in the validation or verification/certification activity selected for the\n        performance assessment. The size of the AT may be reduced or increased to ensure that\n        the competence of the AT is maintained and that the AT may adequately observe the DOE\n        verification team during a performance assessment based on a verification/certification.\n89.     The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object,\n        in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of\n        conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest.\n\n\n\n\n                                              18 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n90.     If the DOE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall consider\n        modifying the composition of the AT within five days of receipt of the objection. If the\n        secretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection\n        of any AT member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 89 above, the AT shall\n        be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection justified and replaces a AT\n        member, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within the same five days. After\n        this, the same steps in paragraphs 89 and 90 above shall repeat until the composition of\n        the AT is deemed accepted.\n91.     Once the composition of the AT is deemed accepted, each AT member shall sign a\n        confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n        004).\n92.     The secretariat shall provide the AT with the documentation for the assessment referred\n        to in paragraph 86 above.\n\n7.5.    Assessment by the AT\n93.     The AT may request additional documents based on the initial review of the documentation\n        for the assessment within five days of receipt of the first set of documentation. The DOE\n        shall submit the requested additional documents within five days of receipt of the request.\n94.     A performance assessment on a validation and verification/certification activity shall be\n        based on the observation of the validation and verification carried out by the DOE team\n        during the on-site inspection at the project activity site(s) and the desk-review evaluation\n        of a draft validation and verification report and other documentary evidence submitted by\n        the DOE.15 Regarding the on-site inspection, the DOE shall, with the support of the\n        secretariat, coordinate the dates and logistics for the visit to the project activity site(s) by\n        its validation and verification team with the AT. The DOE shall submit to the AT a draft\n        validation and verification report, duly reviewed internally for its completeness and\n        adequacy, including Corrective Action Requests, Clarification Requests and/or Forward\n        Action Requests, within 45 days of the on-site inspection.\n95.     The AT shall conduct the assessment of the documentation, including any additional\n        documents that have been requested by the AT.\n96.     The AT shall, within 15 days of receipt of the documentation for the assessment, prepare\n        a draft performance assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-014 or A6.4-FORM-\n        ACCR-015, as applicable), containing findings including those of potential NCs, objective\n        evidence for each finding and a conclusion on whether the DOE conducted the validation\n        or verification/certification activity competently, and make it available to the DOE for\n        comments.\n97.     The DOE shall have five days to seek or provide clarification regarding the findings from\n        or to the AT. The DOE may also submit additional documents to support its clarification.\n98.     The AT shall raise an NC for each finding that the AT concludes to be an issue showing\n        non-compliance with an Article 6.4 accreditation requirement, prepare a non-conformity\n\n\n15 In accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects” and the “Article 6.4\n\n  validation and verification standard for programmes of activities”, an on-site inspection by a DOE may\n  be exempted from certain verification/certification activities. If such verification/certification activity is\n  chosen for a performance assessment, the assessment may be based on the remote inspection and/or\n  the desk-review evaluation.\n\n\n\n                                                   19 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        report for each NC, as applicable, finalize the performance assessment report, including\n        a conclusion on whether the DOE conducted the validation/verification activity\n        competently, and make them available to the DOE for information within five days of the\n        deadline for commenting by the DOE.\n99.     If the AT concludes that the DOE conducted the validation or verification/certification\n        activity incompetently, the AT shall submit the performance assessment report to the AEP\n        within five days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. The AEP shall consider the\n        case in accordance with section 7.6 below. In the interim, any NCs shall continue to be\n        addressed in accordance with the relevant provisions of this section.\n100.    The DOE shall consider the performance assessment report and non-conformity reports\n        and provide a written acceptance of any NCs that it agrees with within five days of receipt\n        of the reports.\n101.    If the DOE disagrees with any NCs raised by the AT, the DOE may request a review of\n        the NCs by the AEP in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this\n        procedure. All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in this\n        section up to the step immediately before the preparation of a (draft) final assessment\n        report. For the NCs placed under review, if the AEP decides to maintain them in\n        accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be\n        addressed as per the provisions in this section and the AT shall prepare a (draft) final\n        assessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with\n        the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft)\n        final assessment report excluding the dropped NCs.\n102.    If the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form\n        A6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the DOE for comments at the same time\n        as the performance assessment report. The DOE shall have five days to provide\n        comments on the draft final assessment report. The AT shall finalize the final assessment\n        report taking into account the comments of the DOE, make it available to the DOE for\n        information, and submit it to the AEP together with the performance assessment report\n        within five days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE. The AEP shall consider the\n        case in accordance with section 7.6 below.\n103.    If the AT has identified one or more NCs, the DOE shall conduct a root-cause analysis\n        and propose corrective actions for each agreed NC, including a time frame for\n        implementation, within 15 days of receipt of the performance assessment report and\n        non-conformity reports.\n104.    The AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis\n        and communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the DOE within five days of receipt\n        of them.\n105.    If the DOE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the\n        deadline referred to in paragraph 103 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment\n        report, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with\n        the performance assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the\n        deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 7.6 below.\n106.    If the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the DOE with\n        explanations to such rejection. The DOE shall have an additional seven days to propose\n        revised corrective actions.\n\n\n\n\n                                              20 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n107.    The AT shall assess the revised proposed corrective actions within five days of their\n        receipt.\n108.    If the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the DOE does not\n        propose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 106 above,\n        the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to the DOE for\n        information, and submit it to the AEP together with the performance assessment report\n        and non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the\n        case in accordance with section 7.6 below.\n109.    If the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by\n        the AT, the DOE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their\n        implementation to the AT within 30 days of their acceptance by the AT.\n110.    The AT shall assess the implementation of all the corrective actions within 10 days of\n        receipt of the evidence of implementation.\n111.    If the DOE does not submit evidence of implementation by the deadline referred to in\n        paragraph 109 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to\n        the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the performance\n        assessment report and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The\n        AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 7.6 below.\n112.    If the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the\n        implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft\n        final assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments within seven days\n        of the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions.\n113.    If the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the DOE\n        shall have an additional 15 days to pursue the implementation of the corrective actions\n        and submit further evidence to the AT.\n114.    The AT shall assess the further implementation of corrective actions within 10 days of\n        receipt of the further evidence. Regardless of whether the AT still considers the\n        implementation of corrective actions unsatisfactory, or whether the DOE has submitted\n        adequate further evidence of implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall\n        prepare a draft final assessment report, including a conclusion on whether the DOE\n        conducted the validation/verification activity competently, and make it available to the DOE\n        for comments within seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further\n        implementation of the corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further\n        evidence, as applicable.\n115.    The DOE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made\n        available to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the\n        DOE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the\n        NCs.\n116.    The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments\n        provided by the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the\n        AEP together with the performance assessment report and non-conformity reports within\n        five days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE.\n\n\n\n\n                                              21 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n7.6.    Consideration by the AEP\n117.    The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or\n        more NCs remain open, it may provide one final opportunity to the DOE to resolve the\n        remaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in the previous section of the\n        procedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment.\n118.    If the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it\n        shall inform the Supervisory Body of the completion of the performance assessment.\n        However, if the AEP considers that the DOE conducted the validation or\n        verification/certification activity incompetently or that at least one NC requires follow-up to\n        verify the effectiveness of the corrective action, it may make a recommendation to the\n        Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 28 above.\n119.    If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 117 above,\n        as applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend one of the\n        following options to the Supervisory Body:\n        (a)     Place the DOE under observation, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3\n                to this procedure;\n        (b)     Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes, based on\n                the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure;\n        (c)     A course of action in accordance with paragraph 28 above.\n120.    The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP\n        recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 119(a) and (b) above, the\n        DOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with\n        the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation is\n        the option referred to in paragraph 119(b) above, the DOE may also request a hearing\n        before the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to\n        this procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP\n        recommendation in accordance with paragraph 121 below shall take place only after the\n        Supervisory Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to\n        this procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken place,\n        as applicable.\n\n7.7.    Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n121.    The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the\n        independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, and decide,\n        based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure, on one of the following\n        options:\n        (a)     Maintain the accreditation of the DOE;\n        (b)     Place the DOE under observation;\n        (c)     Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes.\n122.    The conditions of under-observation status and suspension of accreditation are given in\n        Appendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and lifting an under-observation\n        status and a suspension of accreditation are defined in section 12 and section 13 below,\n        respectively.\n\n\n\n                                               22 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n123.    If the Supervisory Body decides to place the DOE under observation or suspend its\n        accreditation, the secretariat shall promptly update the status of the DOE on the public list\n        of DOEs referred to in paragraph 81 above.\n\n8.      Regular on-site surveillance\n8.1.    General\n124.    A DOE shall be subject to two regular on-site surveillance assessments during its five-\n        year accreditation term: one during the second year and another one during the fourth\n        year of the term.\n125.    If a regular on-site surveillance takes place at more than one office, all office assessments\n        shall be compiled into one reporting, and the final decision on accreditation shall be made\n        based on the outcomes of all offices assessed.\n\n8.2.    Initiation\n126.    The secretariat shall notify the DOE at least 90 days in advance of the 30-day period within\n        which all the office visits for a regular on-site surveillance assessment will take place. The\n        DOE may request a shift of the period by not more than 30 days earlier or later. The DOE\n        and the secretariat shall agree on the period promptly.\n127.    The DOE shall submit to the secretariat the documentation for the assessment specified\n        in Appendix 1 to this procedure within 15 days of the agreement on the period for the office\n        visits.\n\n8.3.    Completeness check\n128.    The secretariat shall undertake a completeness check of the documentation for the\n        assessment. If any of the required documents are not received by the secretariat by the\n        deadline referred to in paragraph 127 above, the secretariat shall send a reminder to the\n        DOE within seven days of the deadline. If any of the required documents are still not\n        received by the secretariat within seven days of sending the reminder, the secretariat shall\n        report the case to the AEP, and the AEP shall make a recommendation to the Supervisory\n        Body to place the DOE under observation.\n\n8.4.    Appointment of the AT and preparation of workplan\n129.    The secretariat shall, within five days of receipt of all required documents from the DOE,\n        submit the draft workplan for the regular on-site surveillance assessment to the AEP for\n        comments. The workplan shall identify the offices where the regular on-site surveillance\n        assessment will be conducted and provide the instructions to the AT on how to assess the\n        corrective actions that were implemented by the DOE to address the NC(s) raised in\n        previous assessments. The workplan may also include that the AT is to observe a meeting\n        of the impartiality committee of the DOE.\n130.    In preparing the draft workplan (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-007) and in identifying which\n        sites to visit, the secretariat shall consider:\n        (a)     The documents submitted by the DOE;\n        (b)     The number of employees of the DOE;\n\n\n\n\n                                               23 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (c)     The functions performed at each office;\n        (d)     The required technical competence of the AT;\n        (e)     The performance of the DOE as monitored through the implementation of the\n                “Procedure on performance monitoring of designated operational entities”;\n        (f)     The volume of the DOE’s validation and verification/certification work;\n        (g)     Any other influencing factors.\n131.    The AEP may provide comments on the draft workplan within five days of receipt of the\n        workplan. The secretariat shall finalize the workplan within five days of the deadline for\n        commenting by the AEP.\n132.    The secretariat shall, within five days of finalization of the workplan, appoint an AT for the\n        assessment, selecting its members from the Accreditation Roster of Experts.\n133.    The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the composition of the AT. The DOE may object,\n        in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any AT member on the basis of\n        conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest.\n134.    If the DOE objects to the selection of an AT member, the secretariat shall consider\n        modifying the composition of the AT within five days of receipt of the objection. If the\n        secretariat considers the objection unjustified, or the DOE does not object to the selection\n        of any AT member within the time frame referred to in paragraph 133 above, the\n        composition of the AT shall be deemed accepted. If the secretariat considers the objection\n        justified and replaces a AT member, it shall inform the DOE of the new AT member within\n        the same five days. After this, the same steps in paragraphs 133 and 134 above shall be\n        repeated until the composition of the AT is deemed accepted.\n135.    Once the composition of the AT is deemed accepted, each AT member shall sign a\n        confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n        004).\n136.    The secretariat shall provide the AT with:\n        (a)     The documentation for the assessment referred to in paragraph 127 above;\n        (b)     The workplan for the assessment.\n\n8.5.    Assessment by the AT\n137.    The AT leader shall coordinate the dates and logistics for the office visits, taking into\n        account the availability of the team members and the DOE and with support from the\n        secretariat. The AT leader shall send an assessment plan to the DOE at least 10 days\n        prior to each office visit.16\n138.    The AT shall review the documentation for the assessment before the office visits.\n139.    The AT shall conduct the assessment at each office identified in the workplan. If the AT\n        identifies any NC, it shall prepare a non-conformity report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-012)\n        for each NC during the office visit. The AT shall provide the DOE with objective evidence\n\n16 The assessment plan shall contain the assessment requirements, assessment schedule, responsibilities\n\n  amongst AT members and administration and logistic information.\n\n\n\n                                                 24 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        for each NC raised. The DOE shall have an opportunity to seek clarification from, and ask\n        questions of, the AT on the NCs raised.\n140.    The DOE shall provide a written acceptance of any NCs that it agrees with during the AT\n        office visit.\n141.    If the DOE disagrees with any NCs raised by the AT, the DOE may request a review of\n        the NCs by the AEP in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this\n        procedure. All agreed NCs shall continue to be addressed as per the provisions in this\n        section up to the step immediately before the preparation of a (draft) final assessment\n        report. For the NCs placed under review, if the AEP decides to maintain them in\n        accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, they shall be\n        addressed as per the provisions in this section, and the AT shall prepare a (draft) final\n        assessment report covering all NCs. If the AEP decides to drop them in accordance with\n        the provisions contained in Appendix 7 to this procedure, the AT shall prepare a (draft)\n        final assessment report excluding the dropped NCs.\n142.    The AT shall prepare an on-site assessment report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-011) and\n        make it available to the DOE with non-conformity reports, as applicable, for information,\n        within 15 days of the completion of the visits to all the offices as per the workplan.\n143.    If the AT has not identified any NC, it shall prepare a draft final assessment report (form\n        A6.4-FORM-ACCR-013) and make it available to the DOE for comments at the same time\n        as the on-site assessment report. The DOE shall have five days from the day the draft\n        final assessment report was made available to it to provide comments on the draft final\n        assessment report. The AT shall finalize the final assessment report taking under\n        consideration the comments of the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and\n        submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report within five days of the\n        deadline for commenting by the DOE. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with\n        section 8.6 below.\n144.    If the AT has identified one or more NCs, the DOE shall conduct a root-cause analysis\n        and propose corrective actions for each agreed NC, including a time frame for\n        implementation, within 15 days of receipt of the on-site assessment report.\n145.    The AT shall assess the proposed corrective actions together with the root-cause analysis\n        and communicate its acceptance or non-acceptance to the DOE within five days of receipt\n        of them.\n146.    If the DOE does not present a root-cause analysis or propose corrective actions by the\n        deadline referred to in paragraph 144 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment\n        report, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with\n        the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within seven days of the\n        deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in accordance with section 8.6 below.\n147.    If the AT does not accept the proposed corrective actions, it shall provide the DOE with\n        explanations to such rejection. The DOE shall have an additional seven days to propose\n        revised corrective actions.\n148.    The AT shall assess the revised proposed corrective actions within five days of receipt of\n        them.\n149.    If the AT does not accept the revised proposed corrective actions, or if the DOE does not\n        propose revised corrective actions by the deadline referred to in paragraph 147 above,\n        the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to the DOE for\n\n\n\n                                              25 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-\n        conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall consider the case in\n        accordance with section 8.6 below.\n150.    If the original or revised proposed corrective actions for all agreed NCs are accepted by\n        the AT, the DOE shall implement all the corrective actions and submit evidence of their\n        implementation to the AT within 30 days of their acceptance by the AT.\n151.    The AT shall assess the implementation of all the corrective actions within 10 days of\n        receipt of the evidence of implementation.\n152.    If the DOE does not submit evidence of implementation by the deadline referred to in\n        paragraph 150 above, the AT shall prepare a final assessment report, make it available to\n        the DOE for information, and submit it to the AEP together with the on-site assessment\n        report and the non-conformity reports within seven days of the deadline. The AEP shall\n        consider the case in accordance with section 8.6 below.\n153.    If the AT considers that all the agreed NCs have been adequately addressed through the\n        implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall close the NCs and prepare a draft\n        final assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments within seven days\n        of the completion of the assessment of the implementation of all the corrective actions.\n154.    If the AT considers that at least one NC has not been adequately addressed, the DOE\n        shall have an additional 15 days to pursue implementation of the corrective actions and\n        submit further evidence to the AT.\n155.    The AT shall assess the further implementation of the corrective actions within 10 days of\n        receipt of the further evidence. Regardless of whether the AT still considers the\n        implementation of corrective actions unsatisfactory, or whether the DOE has submitted\n        adequate further evidence of implementation of the corrective actions, the AT shall\n        prepare a draft final assessment report and make it available to the DOE for comments\n        within seven days of the completion of the assessment of the further implementation of\n        the corrective actions, or the deadline for submission of further evidence, as applicable.\n156.    The DOE shall have five days from the day the draft final assessment report was made\n        available to it to provide comments on the draft final assessment report. At this stage, the\n        DOE shall not provide additional evidence of implementation of corrective actions to the\n        NCs.\n157.    The AT shall finalize the final assessment report, taking under consideration the comments\n        provided by the DOE, make it available to the DOE for information, and submit it to the\n        AEP together with the on-site assessment report and non-conformity reports within five\n        days of the deadline for commenting by the DOE.\n\n8.6.    Consideration by the AEP\n158.    The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or\n        more NCs remain open, it may provide one final opportunity to the DOE to resolve the\n        remaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in the previous section of this\n        procedure, before the AEP concludes the assessment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              26 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n159.    If the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it\n        shall inform the Supervisory Body of the successful completion of the regular on-site\n        surveillance.\n160.    If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 158 above,\n        as applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend to the\n        Supervisory Body, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure, one of\n        the following options:\n        (a)     Place the DOE under observation;\n        (b)     Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes.\n161.    The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP\n        recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 160(a) and (b) above, the\n        DOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with\n        the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation is\n        the option referred to in paragraph 160(b) above, the DOE may also request a hearing\n        before the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to\n        this procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP\n        recommendation in accordance with paragraph 162 below shall take place only after the\n        Supervisory Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to\n        this procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken place,\n        as applicable.\n\n8.7.    Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n162.    The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the\n        independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, and decide,\n        based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure, on one of the following\n        options:\n        (a)     Maintain the accreditation of the DOE;\n        (b)     Place the DOE under observation;\n        (c)     Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes.\n163.    The conditions of under-observation status and suspension of accreditation are given in\n        Appendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and lifting an under-observation\n        status and a suspension of accreditation are defined in section 12 and section 13 below,\n        respectively.\n164.    If the Supervisory Body decides to place the DOE under observation or suspend its\n        accreditation, the secretariat shall promptly update the status of the DOE on the public list\n        of DOEs referred to in paragraph 81 above.\n\n9.      Reaccreditation\n9.1.    Application for reaccreditation\n165.    A DOE that wishes to be re-accredited after the expiry of the current accreditation term\n        shall apply for reaccreditation between 10 and 12 months before the expiry date of the\n        current accreditation term.\n\n\n\n\n                                              27 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n166.    When applying for reaccreditation, the DOE may apply for accreditation in additional\n        sectoral scopes as referred to in section 10 below.\n167.    The DOE shall submit to the secretariat a duly completed application form (form A6.4-\n        FORM-ACCR-001) and all other documents specified in Appendix 1 to this procedure and\n        pay the application fee specified in Appendix 9 to this procedure.\n168.    The application of a DOE for reaccreditation shall be considered duly submitted when the\n        secretariat has received both the application documentation and the application fee.\n\n9.2.    General modalities\n169.    The provisions and timelines in sections 6.3–6.5 above regarding the completeness\n        check, appointment of an AT, preparation of a workplan, desk review and on-site\n        assessment shall apply mutatis mutandis, except for:\n        (a)     Publication of the name of the DOE and the sectoral scopes applied for global\n                stakeholder consultation, which is not necessary;\n        (b)     The time frame for implementing corrective actions referred to in paragraph 67\n                above, which shall be 30 days instead of 60 days;\n        (c)     The additional time frame for pursuing the implementation of corrective actions\n                referred to in paragraph 71 above, which shall be 15 days instead of 30 days;\n        (d)     The workplan, which shall provide the instructions to the AT on how to assess the\n                corrective actions that were implemented by the DOE to address the NC(s) raised\n                in previous assessments.\n170.    The performance assessments initiated but not completed before a DOE is re-accredited\n        shall remain in effect regardless of the proceeding of reaccreditation assessment.\n171.    In case of a delay in the reaccreditation process, the AEP may recommend that the\n        Supervisory Body extend the accreditation of the DOE accordingly and the Supervisory\n        Body shall consider the AEP’s recommendation in the next meeting. The extension shall\n        be granted only if the DOE has applied for reaccreditation within the time frame referred\n        to in paragraph 165 above and the DOE is not fully responsible for the delay in the process\n        of reaccreditation.\n172.    The DOE may voluntarily withdraw its application for reaccreditation by submitting a\n        written notification of withdrawal any time before the meeting of the Supervisory Body at\n        which a decision on the reaccreditation is due to be made in accordance with\n        paragraph 177 below.\n\n9.3.    Consideration by the AEP\n173.    The AEP shall consider the reports prepared by the AT. If the AEP considers that one or\n        more NCs remain open, it may provide one final opportunity to the DOE to resolve the\n\n\n\n\n                                             28 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        remaining NCs in accordance with the relevant provisions in section 6.5 above, before the\n        AEP concludes the assessment.\n174.    If the AEP considers that all NCs have been closed or that no NCs have been raised, it\n        shall recommend that the Supervisory Body re-accredit the DOE for all sectoral scopes\n        applied for.\n175.    If the AEP considers that, after the final opportunity referred to in paragraph 173 above,\n        as applicable, there still remains one or more open NCs, it shall recommend to the\n        Supervisory Body one of the following options:\n        (a)     Re-accredit the DOE only for some sectoral scopes applied for;\n        (b)     Temporarily extend the accreditation of the DOE and, based on the criteria\n                contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure:\n                (i)    Place the DOE under observation; or\n                (ii)   Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for all sectoral scopes;\n        (c)     Reject the application for reaccreditation.\n176.    The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP\n        recommendation is one of the options referred to in paragraph 175(a), (b) and (c) above,\n        the DOE may request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance\n        with the provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation\n        is one of the options referred to in paragraph 175(b)(ii) and (c) above, the DOE may also\n        request a hearing before the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions\n        contained in Appendix 8 to this procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the\n        Supervisory Body on the AEP recommendation in accordance with paragraph 177 below\n        shall take place only after the Supervisory Body has received the independent review\n        report referred to in Appendix 5 to this procedure and decided on the review case, and\n        only after the hearing has taken place, as applicable.\n\n9.4.    Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n177.    The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP together with the\n        independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, and decide on\n        one of the following options:\n        (a)     Re-accredit the DOE for all sectoral scopes applied for;\n        (b)     Re-accredit the DOE only for some sectoral scopes applied for;\n        (c)     Temporarily extend the accreditation of the DOE and based on the criteria\n                contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure:\n                (i)    Place the DOE under observation; or\n                (ii)   Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for all sectoral scopes;\n        (d)     Reject the application for reaccreditation.\n178.    The conditions of under-observation status and suspension of accreditation are given in\n        Appendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and lifting an under-observation\n        status and a suspension of accreditation are defined in section 12 and section 13 below,\n        respectively.\n\n\n\n                                               29 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n179.    If the Supervisory Body decides to re-accredit the DOE, the secretary of the Supervisory\n        Body shall issue an accreditation certificate to the DOE. The new accreditation term shall\n        be valid for five years from the date of expiry of the previous accreditation term.\n180.    The secretariat shall promptly update the status of the DOE on the public list of DOEs\n        referred to in paragraph 81 above.\n\n10. Accreditation for additional sectoral scopes\n181.    A DOE may apply for accreditation for additional sectoral scopes at any time within its\n        accreditation term.\n182.    The AEP shall consider the application and decide on the scope of the assessment, taking\n        into account the sectoral scopes for which the DOE is currently accredited, and the\n        additional sectoral scopes applied for.\n183.    The provisions and timelines defined in sections 6.3–6.7 above regarding the\n        completeness check, appointment of a AT, preparation of a workplan, desk review, on-\n        site assessment, and consideration by the AEP and the Supervisory Body shall apply\n        mutatis mutandis, except for:\n        (a)     Publication of the name of the DOE and the additional sectoral scopes applied for\n                global stakeholder consultation, which is not necessary;\n        (b)     The time frame for implementing corrective actions referred to in paragraph 67\n                above, which shall be 30 days instead of 60 days;\n        (c)     The additional time frame for pursuing the implementation of corrective actions\n                referred to in paragraph 71 above, which shall be 15 days instead of 30 days.\n184.    An accreditation for a maximum of three additional sectoral scopes may be granted based\n        on an assessment performed and consideration given in accordance with sections 6.5–\n        6.7 above but without conducting any site visit.\n185.    The accreditation for additional sectoral scopes of a DOE shall be valid only until the expiry\n        of the existing accreditation term of the DOE. It is noted that the application of additional\n        sectoral scope can also be applied along with the application of reaccreditation as referred\n        in to paragraph 166 above.\n\n11. Spot-check\n11.1. Initiation\n186.    The Supervisory Body may decide to conduct a spot-check of a DOE at any time during\n        its accreditation term.\n187.    The consideration by the Supervisory Body to conduct a spot-check of a DOE may be\n        triggered by, inter alia:\n        (a)     The review process conducted by the Supervisory Body on a request for\n                registration or a request for issuance submitted by the DOE;\n        (b)     Information received from a third party on the possible inadequate performance of\n                the DOE in its validation or verification/certification activities as well as on any\n                changes which may significantly impair the compliance of the DOE with Article 6.4\n\n\n\n                                               30 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n                accreditation requirements, such as changes in ownership, organizational\n                structure, internal policies and procedures, resources and personnel;\n        (c)     A recommendation of the AEP based on, inter alia, the result of handling\n                complaints against the DOE in accordance with Appendix 6 to this procedure.\n188.    The reason that triggered a spot-check shall remain confidential.\n189.    The Supervisory Body may decide to immediately suspend the accreditation of the DOE\n        under a spot-check. If the Supervisory Body decides to do so, it shall provide the DOE\n        with an opportunity for a hearing at a Supervisory Body meeting prior to suspending the\n        accreditation. Also in this case, the assessment for lifting the suspension in accordance\n        with section 13 below shall not be initiated until and unless the Supervisory Body decides\n        to continue the suspension based on the outcome of the spot-check conducted in\n        accordance with the present section.\n190.    The Supervisory Body, once it has decided to conduct a spot-check, shall agree on the\n        scope of the spot-check. For this purpose, if the AEP recommends that the Supervisory\n        Body conduct a spot-check, it shall also propose the scope of the spot-check.\n191.    The AEP shall initiate a spot-check of a DOE if its performance on validation or\n        verification/certification activities as monitored through the implementation of the\n        “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated operational entities” declines, as the\n        final version of a monitoring report prepared in accordance with the procedure shows that\n        the DOE is in the red zone for the indicators I2 or I3.\n192.    Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 191 above, the AEP may not initiate a spot-\n        check of a DOE that has reached the red zone of indicators I2 or I3 if the following two\n        conditions are met:\n        (a)     The issues in the scope of the spot-check have been covered and resolved in\n                recent assessments;\n        (b)     A visit to the central office of the DOE under a regular on-site surveillance or\n                reaccreditation assessment is planned to take place in the next 90 days; in such\n                case, the issues envisaged for the spot-check shall be considered and addressed\n                in the regular surveillance or reaccreditation assessment.\n193.    If the AEP initiates a spot-check of a DOE in accordance with paragraph 191 above, it\n        shall agree on the scope of the spot-check and inform the Supervisory Body of the initiation\n        of the spot-check and the scope. The scope shall be based on the information gathered\n        in the implementation of the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of designated\n        operational entities”.\n194.

If the Supervisory Body decides to withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, it shall provide\n        the reason for such action to the DOE and make publicly available the requirements\n        regarding which such action was prompted.\n243.    Upon withdrawal of accreditation by the Supervisory Body, the entity shall return the\n        accreditation certificate referred to in paragraph 80 above to the secretariat and cease all\n        validation and verification/certification activities for the sectoral scopes for which the\n        accreditation was withdrawn.\n244.    If the Supervisory Body decides to withdraw the accreditation of the DOE, the secretariat\n        shall promptly update the status on the public list of DOEs referred to in paragraph 81\n        above.\n245.    The DOE shall inform, if applicable, any affected clients of the withdrawal of its\n        accreditation status.\n246.    The DOE shall settle all outstanding fees and costs to be paid to AT members for their\n        assessment work for the DOE.\n\n15. Expiry of accreditation\n247.    Upon expiry of accreditation of a DOE, the entity shall not continue any validation and\n        verification/certification activities for the sectoral scopes for which the accreditation has\n        expired.\n248.    The DOE shall inform, if applicable, any affected clients of the expiry of its accreditation\n        status.\n\n16. Transfer of accreditation to another entity\n249.    A DOE may submit to the secretariat a request for the transfer of its accreditation to\n        another entity (succeeding entity) by providing information on, inter alia:\n        (a)     Requested date of transfer of accreditation, which shall be at least 90 days after\n                the submission of the request;\n        (b)     Reason for the request for the transfer of accreditation;\n        (c)     Relationship between the DOE and the succeeding entity, including changes to\n                ownership and/or shareholding, as appropriate;\n        (d)     Financial stability and insurance coverage of the succeeding entity;\n\n\n\n\n                                              39 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (e)     Pending judicial processes that could affect the                     validation   and\n                verification/certification functions of the succeeding entity;\n        (f)     Impact on the validation and verification/certification functions, including\n                changes to:\n                (i)     Legal status and applicability of national laws and regulations;\n                (ii)    Relevant policies, procedures and practices;\n                (iii)   Relevant personnel;\n        (g)     List of the ongoing validation and verification/certification activities and impact on\n                them.\n250.    The secretariat shall undertake a completeness check of the request. If the information\n        provided is found incomplete or insufficient, the secretariat shall inform the DOE of the\n        missing elements within seven days of receipt of the request. Subsequent steps of the\n        process shall only continue once all requested information has been received by the\n        secretariat.\n251.    The secretariat, after receipt of all requested information, shall carry out and conclude a\n        desk review of the request documentation within 10 days and submit the outcome to the\n        AEP.\n252.    The desk review shall cover at minimum the following:\n        (a)     How the financial stability would be impacted due to the transfer;\n        (b)     Whether any pending judicial processes could impede the succeeding entity from\n                carrying out its validation and verification/certification functions;\n        (c)     How the relevant policies, procedures and practices would be impacted due to the\n                transfer;\n        (d)     How the availability and competence of personnel involved in the validation and\n                verification/certification functions would be impacted due to the transfer;\n        (e)     How the ongoing validation and verification/certification activities would be\n                impacted due to the transfer.\n253.    The AEP shall consider the request based on the outcome of the desk review and decide\n        whether to request an AT or the secretariat to conduct a further assessment, and if so, the\n        type and modalities of the assessment.\n254.    If the AEP decides to request an AT to conduct a further assessment, the appointment of\n        the AT and the preparation of a workplan shall follow the provisions in paragraphs 129–\n        136 above mutatis mutandis.\n255.    If the AEP decides to request an AT or the secretariat to conduct a further assessment,\n        the AT or the secretariat shall conduct the further assessment in accordance with the type\n        and modalities specified by the AEP.\n256.    The AEP shall, after the receipt of the outcome of the further assessment, as applicable,\n        recommend to the Supervisory Body one of the following options:\n        (a)     Approve the transfer of accreditation;\n\n\n\n                                                40 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (b)     Reject the request for transfer of accreditation and:\n                (i)    Maintain the accreditation of the DOE; or\n                (ii)   Withdraw the accreditation of the DOE in accordance with section 14.2\n                       above.\n257.    The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the recommendation of the AEP. If the AEP\n        recommendation is the option referred to in paragraph 256(b) above, the DOE may\n        request an independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with the\n        provisions contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP recommendation is the\n        option referred to in paragraph 256(b)(ii) above, the DOE may also request a hearing\n        before the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to\n        this procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP\n        recommendation in accordance with paragraph 258 below shall take place only after the\n        Supervisory Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to\n        this procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken place,\n        as applicable.\n258.    The Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of the AEP, together with the\n        independent review report and/or the hearing of the DOE, as applicable, and decide on\n        one of the following options:\n        (a)     Approve the transfer of accreditation;\n        (b)     Reject the request for transfer of accreditation and:\n                (i)    Maintain the accreditation of the DOE; or\n                (ii)   Withdraw the accreditation of the DOE;\n        (c)     Conduct an additional assessment.\n259.    If the Supervisory Body decides to approve the transfer of accreditation, the DOE shall\n        transfer all records of past and ongoing validation and verification/certification activities to\n        the succeeding entity, and the succeeding entity shall assume all responsibilities\n        associated with those validation and verification/certification activities.\n260.    Upon the approval of transfer of accreditation, the DOE shall return the accreditation\n        certificate referred to in paragraph 80 above to the secretariat and cease all validation and\n        verification/certification activities. The secretariat shall promptly issue an accreditation\n        certificate to the succeeding entity.\n261.    The conditions of withdrawal of accreditation are given in Appendix 4 to this procedure.\n        The modalities for placing a withdrawal of accreditation are defined in section 14 above.\n262.    If the Supervisory Body decides to approve the transfer of accreditation or withdraw the\n        accreditation of the DOE, the secretariat shall promptly update the status on the public list\n        of DOEs referred to in paragraph 81 above.\n263.    The DOE shall inform, if applicable, any affected clients of the transfer of its accreditation.\n264.    If the Supervisory Body decides to reject the request for transfer of accreditation, it shall\n        provide the reason for such action to the DOE. In this case, the DOE may voluntarily\n        withdraw its accreditation in accordance with section 14.1 above, and the succeeding\n        entity may apply for accreditation in accordance with section 6 above.\n\n\n\n                                                41 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n265.    If the Supervisory Body decides to conduct an additional assessment, the AEP and the\n        secretariat or the AT shall undertake further actions accordingly.\n\n17. Notification of changes\n266.    An AE/DOE shall notify the secretariat, at least 90 days before its implementation, of a\n        planned change in its legal, commercial or organizational status.\n267.    An AE/DOE shall inform the secretariat, at least 30 days before its implementation, of the\n        following planned changes:\n        (a)     Change in the organizational structure and/or top management;\n        (b)     Companies to which the DOE will outsource one or more validation and/or\n                verification/certification functions.\n268.    If the AE/DOE does not notify the secretariat of changes referred to in paragraphs 266-267\n        above by the deadlines specified in these paragraphs, the AEP may recommend that the\n        Supervisory Body initiate a spot-check or place the DOE under observation.\n269.    The AEP shall consider the notified change and decide whether to conduct a further\n        assessment – for example, a document review and/or a site visit – on a case-by-case\n        basis. In doing so, the AEP may decide not to conduct a specific assessment, but to\n        assess the notified changes in a future regular on-site surveillance or reaccreditation\n        assessment.\n270.    If the AEP decides to request an AT to conduct a further assessment, the appointment of\n        the AT and the preparation of a workplan shall follow the provisions in paragraphs 129–\n        136 above mutatis mutandis.\n271.    The AEP shall, based on the outcome of the further assessment, as applicable, decide on\n        one of the following options:\n        (a)     Accept or reject the changes of the AE/DOE;\n        (b)     Reject the changes of the AE and request the AT conducting the assessment for\n                initial accreditation of the AE to take into account the changes;\n        (c)     Recommend that the Supervisory Body place the DOE under observation;\n        (d)     Recommend that the Supervisory Body suspend the accreditation of the DOE for\n                some or all sectoral scopes;\n        (e)     Recommend that the Supervisory Body withdraw the accreditation of the DOE for\n                some or all sectoral scopes.\n272.    The secretariat shall inform the DOE of the decision of the AEP. If the AEP decision is one\n        of the options referred to in paragraph 271(b)-(e) above, the DOE may request an\n        independent review of the AEP recommendation in accordance with the provisions\n        contained in Appendix 5 to this procedure. If the AEP decision is one of the options\n        referred to in paragraph 271(d) and (e) above, the DOE may also request a hearing before\n        the Supervisory Body in accordance with the provisions contained in Appendix 8 to this\n        procedure. In these cases, the consideration by the Supervisory Body on the AEP\n        recommendation in accordance with paragraph 273 below shall take place only after the\n        Supervisory Body has received the independent review report referred to in Appendix 5 to\n\n\n\n\n                                             42 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        this procedure and decided on the review case, and only after the hearing has taken place,\n        as applicable.\n273.    If the AEP submits a recommendation to the Supervisory Body in accordance with\n        paragraph 271(c)-(e) above, the Supervisory Body shall consider the recommendation of\n        the AEP, together with the independent review report and the hearing of the DOE, as\n        applicable, and decide, based on the criteria contained in Appendix 3 to this procedure,\n        on one of the following options:\n        (a)     Accept the changes of the DOE;\n        (b)     Place the DOE under observation;\n        (c)     Suspend the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes;\n        (d)     Withdraw the accreditation of the DOE for some or all sectoral scopes.\n274.    The conditions of under-observation status, suspension and withdrawal of accreditation\n        are given in Appendix 4 to this procedure. The modalities for placing and/or lifting an\n        under-observation status, a suspension and a withdrawal of accreditation are defined in\n        section 12, section 13 and section 14 above, respectively.\n275.    If the Supervisory Body decides to place the DOE under observation, or suspend or\n        withdraw its accreditation, the secretariat shall promptly update the status of the DOE on\n        the public list of DOEs referred to in paragraph 81 above.\n\n18. Reporting of activities\n276.    A DOE shall submit an annual activity report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-022) to the\n        secretariat by 30 September every year until its accreditation expires or is withdrawn.\n277.    The annual activity report shall cover the period from 1 July of the preceding year to\n        30 June of the current year.\n278.    The annual activity report shall be treated as confidential.\n279.    The annual activity report shall be signed by the chief executive officer of the DOE before\n        submission to the secretariat.\n\n\n\n\n                                              43 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1.

Criteria for under-observation status, and\n            suspension and withdrawal of accreditation\n\n1.      The following are criteria to be used by the Article 6.4 Accreditation Panel (AEP) to make\n        a recommendation and by the Supervisory Body to make a decision on whether to place\n        a designated operational entity (DOE) under observation or suspend its accreditation in\n        accordance with a relevant provision of this procedure.\n2.      The criteria for placing a DOE under observation are as follows:\n        (a)     There is an open non-conformity (NC) that is not referred to in paragraph 3(a) of\n                this appendix; or\n        (b)     There is an NC against the same Article 6.4 accreditation requirement raised for\n                the DOE for a second time in the last 12 months; or\n        (c)     The recommendation made by the AEP as referred to in paragraphs 27 and 28 of\n                this procedure, or\n        (d)     There is a failure on the part of the DOE to follow any provision in this procedure,\n                such as:\n                (i)    Failure to submit records, information, reports or other materials requested\n                       as deemed necessary to determine continued conformity with the\n                       accreditation requirements;\n                (ii)   Failure to accommodate a request to undergo an assessment.\n3.      The criteria for suspending the accreditation of a DOE are as follows:\n        (a)     There is an open NC that is at the system level and a significant shortcoming, not\n                an isolated or sporadic lapse, by the DOE to meet an Article 6.4 accreditation\n                requirement, and the continuation of the validation and/or verification/certification\n                activities of the DOE would threaten the credibility the Article 6.4 accreditation\n                system; or\n        (b)     The DOE intentionally provided false information, intentionally omitted information\n                that should have been provided, or deliberately violated any Article 6.4\n                accreditation requirement as referred to in paragraph 27 of this procedure, except\n                for the case referred to in paragraph 4(a) of this appendix;\n        (c)     The recommendation made by the AEP as referred to in paragraphs 27 and 28 of\n                this procedure; or\n        (d)     The DOE placed under observation fails to close an open NC within the pre-\n                specified time frame.\n4.

Independent review of Article 6.4 Accreditation\n            Panel recommendations\n\n1.      Definitions applicable to this appendix\n1.      An “adverse recommendation” is a recommendation by the Article 6.4 Accreditation Panel\n        (AEP) to the Supervisory Body that, if adopted as a decision by the Supervisory Body\n        pursuant to this procedure, would affect the accreditation status of a designated\n        operational entity (DOE) or constitute an obstacle to maintaining or extending\n        accreditation by DOE, or to obtaining accreditation by an applicant entity (AE), made in\n        accordance with the relevant provisions of this procedure.\n2.      A “request for independent review” means a request from an AE or DOE to the Supervisory\n        Body to appoint an independent panel of experts to conduct a review of an adverse\n        recommendation where the AE/DOE considers the adverse recommendation to be in\n        breach of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard” and/or this procedure.\n\n2.      Submission of a request for independent review\n3.      An AE/DOE may submit to the secretariat a request for independent review of an adverse\n        recommendation of the AEP, using the relevant form (A6.4-FORM-ACCR-016), within\n        seven days of being informed of the adverse recommendation. The submission shall\n        include evidence of the payment of the fee referred to in paragraph 5 of this appendix.\n4.      The AE/DOE shall specify the particular provisions of the “Article 6.4 accreditation\n        standard” and/or this procedure that it considers the adverse recommendation breaches\n        and shall provide justification and evidence to support its view.\n5.      A fee of USD 2,000 shall be payable by the AE/DOE upon submission of the request.\n\n3.      Completeness check of the request for independent review\n6.      Upon receipt of the request for independent review, the secretariat shall acknowledge the\n        receipt promptly.\n7.      The secretariat shall, within seven days of receipt of the request for independent review,\n        undertake a completeness check to confirm that the request for independent review has\n        been duly submitted and includes all relevant documents to carry out a preliminary\n        assessment, including evidence of payment of the fee. The secretariat may request the\n        AE/DOE to submit further relevant information. The AE/DOE shall submit such information\n        within seven days or explain why such information cannot be submitted. If no response is\n        received from the AE/DOE within this time frame, the secretariat shall cease the\n        completeness check and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request for independent\n        review.\n\n4.      Preliminary assessment of the request for independent review\n8.      The secretariat, after receipt of the request for independent review or further information\n        or explanation if requested in accordance with paragraph 7 of this appendix, shall carry\n        out and conclude a preliminary assessment of the request for independent review within\n        10 days.\n\n\n\n                                             52 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n9.      The preliminary assessment shall cover as a minimum the following:\n        (a)     Whether the request for independent review was submitted by the deadline\n                referred to in paragraph 3 of this appendix;\n        (b)     Whether the request         for    independent    review    relates   to   an   adverse\n                recommendation;\n        (c)     Whether specific provisions of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard” and/or this\n                procedure have been identified.\n10.     If the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for independent review does not\n        meet all the conditions referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall\n        cease the preliminary assessment and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request\n        for independent review.\n11.     If the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for independent review meets all\n        the conditions referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall inform the\n        AEP and the Supervisory Body of the request for independent review.\n\n5.      Assessment of the request for independent review\n12.     The secretariat shall, within five days of successful conclusion of the preliminary\n        assessment, provide the AEP and the Supervisory Body with the request for independent\n        review and all supporting documentation received from the AE/DOE or prepared by the\n        secretariat.\n13.     The secretariat shall, within the same five days of successful conclusion of the preliminary\n        assessment, also prepare a list of five experts, selecting from the Accreditation Roster of\n        Experts, the Methodologies Roster of Experts or the Registration and Issuance Team, as\n        candidates for an independent panel to conduct an independent review of the adverse\n        recommendation, and send the list to the AE/DOE.\n14.     The AE/DOE may object, in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any\n        expert on the list on the basis of conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest.\n15.     If the AE/DOE objects to the selection of an expert, the secretariat shall, within five days,\n        consider modifying the list of experts. If the secretariat considers the objection unjustified,\n        or the AE/DOE does not object to the selection of any expert within the time frame referred\n        to in paragraph 14 of this appendix, the list of experts shall be deemed accepted. If the\n        secretariat considers the objection justified and modifies the list of experts, it shall send\n        the modified list to the AE/DOE within the same five days. After this, the same steps in\n        paragraphs 14 and 15 of this appendix shall repeat until the list of experts is deemed\n        accepted.\n16.     At the earliest possible Supervisory Body meeting taking place after the list of experts is\n        deemed accepted, the secretariat shall submit to the Supervisory Body the list of experts.\n        The Supervisory Body shall, at that meeting, establish the independent panel, by\n        appointing up to three experts from the list submitted by the secretariat, and request the\n        independent panel to prepare a report. The secretariat shall inform the DOE and AEP of\n        the names of the appointed experts.\n17.     Once the Supervisory Body establishes the independent panel, the appointed experts\n        shall sign a confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-\n        FORM-ACCR-004).\n\n\n\n                                                  53 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n18.     The secretariat shall promptly forward the request for independent review and all\n        supporting documentation to the independent panel.\n\n6.      Independent panel review of the adverse recommendation\n19.     The independent panel may, within seven days of receipt of the request for independent\n        review and all related documentation, request further information from the AEP and/or\n        AE/DOE. The AEP and/or AE/DOE shall submit such information or explain why such\n        information cannot be submitted within seven days of receipt of such request. If the\n        AE/DOE fails to do so, the independent panel shall conduct and finalize the review based\n        on the available information in accordance with paragraph 20 of this appendix.\n20.     The independent panel shall review the case based on the documentation provided to it,\n        and by no later than 15 days from the appointment of the experts shall submit an\n        independent review report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-017) to the secretariat, including a\n        summary of the adverse recommendation, an assessment of whether the particular\n        provisions of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard” or this procedure have been\n        breached, and a recommendation to the Supervisory Body on whether to follow the original\n        recommendation of the AEP.\n21.     The secretariat shall submit the independent review report and all related documentation\n        to the Supervisory Body, the AEP and the AE/DOE within five days of receipt of the\n        independent review report.\n\n7.      Decision by the Supervisory Body\n22.     The Supervisory Body shall, at the earliest possible meeting taking place after the receipt\n        of the independent review report, consider the request for independent review with all\n        supporting documentation submitted by the AE/DOE, the adverse recommendation, the\n        independent review report, and any other relevant documentation, and decide on one of\n        the following options:\n        (a)     The adverse recommendation was not in breach of the “Article 6.4 accreditation\n                standard” and/or this procedure. In this case, the Supervisory Body shall consider\n                the adverse recommendation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this\n                procedure; or\n        (b)     The adverse recommendation was in breach of the “Article 6.4 accreditation\n                standard” and/or this procedure. In this case, the Supervisory Body shall either\n                request the AEP to reconsider the adverse recommendation or take other action\n                in accordance with the relevant provisions of this procedure. The secretariat shall\n                reimburse the fee referred to in paragraph 5 of this appendix to the AE/DOE in full.\n23.     If the adverse recommendation is to suspend or withdraw accreditation of the DOE and\n        where the DOE has requested a hearing in accordance with the relevant provisions of this\n        procedure, such hearing shall be held at the same meeting and in conjunction with the\n        Supervisory Body’s consideration pursuant to paragraph 22 of this appendix.\n24.     The secretariat shall promptly inform the DOE and the AEP of the Supervisory Body’s\n        decision.\n25.     The decision of the Supervisory Body on the request for independent review shall not be\n        subject to further review under this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                              54 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 6. Review of complaints against designated\n            operational entities\n\n1.      Definitions applicable to this appendix\n1.      A “complaint” is a written communication addressed to the Article 6.4 Accreditation Panel\n        (AEP) expressing a view that a designated operational entity (DOE) has breached a\n        specific provision of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard” and/or any relevant procedure\n        under the Article 6.4.\n2.      A “complainant” is, for the purpose of this procedure, restricted to the following:\n        (a)     An entity or organization with a contractual relationship with the DOE for the\n                validation or verification/certification of the particular Article 6.4 project (A6.4\n                project) or programme of activities (A6.4 PoA) in respect of which the complaint is\n                made; or\n        (b)     An entity, organization or person that submitted comments during the global\n                stakeholder consultation process for an A6.4 project or A6.4 PoA that were not\n                taken into consideration by the DOE in the final validation report.\n\n2.      Submission of a complaint\n3.      Only a complainant as defined in paragraph 2 of this appendix may submit a complaint.\n4.      A complainant shall submit a complaint to the secretariat using the relevant form (A6.4-\n        FORM-ACCR-018) and providing all supporting documentation. The complainant shall\n        describe the specific conduct of the DOE that is alleged to be in breach of the “A6.4\n        accreditation standard” or this procedure and provide evidence. All documentation\n        submitted by the complainant to support the complaint may be treated as non-confidential\n        by the secretariat in order that such information may be forwarded to the DOE in\n        accordance with paragraph 11 of this appendix.\n5.      The complainant shall also provide evidence that it has exhausted the internal procedures\n        of the DOE for handling complaints or that the DOE has breached its internal procedures\n        for handling complaints.\n\n3.      Completeness check of the complaint\n6.      Upon receipt of a complaint in accordance with paragraph 4 of this appendix, the\n        secretariat shall acknowledge receipt promptly.\n7.      The secretariat shall, within seven days of receipt of the complaint, undertake a\n        completeness check to confirm that the complaint has been duly submitted. The\n        secretariat may request the complainant to submit further information. The complainant\n        shall submit such information within five days or explain why such information cannot be\n        submitted. If no response is received from the complainant within this time frame, the\n        secretariat shall cease the completeness check and inform the complainant of the closure\n        of the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                              55 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n4.      Preliminary assessment of the complaint\n8.      The secretariat, after receipt of the complaint or further documentation or explanation if\n        requested pursuant to paragraph 7 of this appendix, shall carry out and conclude a\n        preliminary assessment of the complaint within 10 days.\n9.      The preliminary assessment shall cover as a minimum the following:\n        (a)     Whether the submitter is a complainant;\n        (b)     Whether the complainant has identified specific conduct of the DOE that the\n                complainant considers to be in breach of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”\n                and/or any relevant procedure under the Article 6.4;\n        (c)     Whether the complainant referred to in paragraph 2(a) of this appendix has\n                exhausted the internal procedures of the DOE for handling complaints or provided\n                evidence that the DOE has breached its internal procedures for handling\n                complaints.\n10.     If the preliminary assessment reveals that the complaint does not meet all the conditions\n        referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall cease the preliminary\n        assessment and inform the complainant of the closure of the complaint.\n11.     Where the preliminary assessment reveals that the complaint meets all the conditions\n        referred to in paragraph 9 of this appendix, the secretariat shall inform the DOE of the\n        complaint and shall provide the DOE with the complaint and the supporting documentation\n        received from the complainant.\n12.     The DOE shall have seven days from the receipt of the complaint from the secretariat to\n        provide a response to the complaint and shall submit the response to the secretariat with\n        all necessary supporting documentation.\n\n5.      Assessment of the complaint\n13.     The secretariat shall prepare an assessment report on the substance of the complaint\n        (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-019) and submit it to the AEP within 30 days of the deadline\n        referred to in paragraph 12 of this appendix, including a summary of the complaint, an\n        assessment of whether the particular provisions of the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”\n        or this procedure have been breached, and a recommendation to the AEP as to whether\n        the complaint is substantiated.\n14.     The secretariat may, during the preparation of the assessment report, request the\n        complainant and/or the DOE to provide further information. The complainant and/or the\n        DOE shall submit such information within seven days of receipt of such request. If no\n        response is received from the complainant and/or the DOE within this time frame, the\n        secretariat shall note so in its assessment report.\n\n6.      Decision by the AEP\n15.     The AEP shall consider the complaint with all supporting documentation submitted by the\n        complainant, the assessment report prepared by the secretariat, and any other relevant\n        documentation, and decide on one of the following options:\n        (a)     A complaint is considered substantiated if the AEP concludes, based on the\n                documentation available to it in relation to the complaint, that the DOE has\n\n\n\n                                             56 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n                breached a specific requirement set out in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”\n                and/or this procedure;\n        (b)     A complaint is not considered substantiated if the AEP concludes, based on the\n                documentation available to it in relation to the complaint, that the DOE has not\n                breached a specific requirement set out in the “Article 6.4 accreditation standard”\n                and/or this procedure, or that the complainant has not sufficiently demonstrated\n                that such a breach has occurred.\n16.     If the AEP concludes that the complaint is substantiated, it shall specify aspects of the\n        system of the DOE that shall be assessed in a future accreditation assessment of the\n        DOE.\n17.     If the AEP concludes that the complaint is not substantiated, no further action shall be\n        taken as a result of the complaint.\n18.     The secretariat shall inform the complainant and the DOE of the AEP decision on the\n        complaint.\n19.     The decision of the AEP on the complaint shall not be subject to further review under this\n        procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                              57 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 7. Review of non-conformities raised by Article 6.4\n            Assessment Team\n\n1.      Definitions applicable to this appendix\n1.      A “request for review of an NC” is a written communication from an applicant entity (AE)\n        or a designated operational entity (DOE) addressed to the Article 6.4 Accreditation Panel\n        (AEP), expressing disagreement with an Article 6.4 assessment team (AT) on a non-\n        conformity (NC) raised during an accreditation assessment and requesting a review by\n        the AEP on the NC in accordance with the relevant provisions of this procedure.\n\n2.      Submission of a request for review of a non-conformity\n2.      An AE or a DOE may submit a request for review of an NC to the secretariat within seven\n        days of receipt of the non-conformity report through which the NC was raised by an AT,\n        using the relevant form (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-020) and providing all supporting\n        documentation. The submission shall include evidence of payment of the fee referred to\n        in paragraph 4 of this appendix.\n3.      The AE/DOE may submit to the secretariat more than one request for review of an NC at\n        the same time, each covering one NC. In this case, each request shall be deemed a\n        separate request.\n4.      A fee of USD 1,000 per request for review of an NC shall be payable by the AE/DOE upon\n        submission of the request.\n\n3.      Completeness check of the request for review of a non-conformity\n5.      Upon receipt of the request for review of an NC in accordance with paragraph 2 of this\n        appendix, the secretariat shall acknowledge the receipt promptly.\n6.      The secretariat shall, within seven days of receipt of the request for review of an NC,\n        undertake a completeness check to confirm that the request has been duly submitted. The\n        secretariat may request the AE/DOE to submit further information. The AE/DOE shall\n        submit such information within seven days or explain why such information cannot be\n        submitted. If no response is received, the secretariat shall cease the completeness check\n        and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request for independent review.\n\n4.      Preliminary assessment of the request for review of a non-conformity\n7.      The secretariat, after receipt of the request for review of an NC or further information or\n        explanation, if requested in accordance with paragraph 6 of this appendix, shall carry out\n        and conclude a preliminary assessment of the request for review of an NC within 10 days.\n8.      The preliminary assessment shall cover as a minimum the following:\n        (a)     Whether the request for review of an NC was submitted by the deadline referred\n                to in paragraph 2 of this appendix;\n        (b)     Whether the request for review of an NC is related to the interpretation of an Article\n                6.4 accreditation requirement, not a procedural matter;\n\n\n\n                                               58 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n        (c)     Whether the AE/DOE has provided a reason, and supporting documentation as\n                appropriate, for the disagreement with the AT on the NC.\n9.      If the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for review of an NC does not meet\n        all the conditions mentioned in paragraph 8 of this appendix, the secretariat shall cease\n        the preliminary assessment and inform the AE/DOE of the closure of the request for review\n        of an NC.\n10.     If the preliminary assessment reveals that the request for review of an NC meets all the\n        conditions referred to in paragraph 8 of this appendix, the secretariat shall inform the AEP,\n        AT and the AE/DOE of the request accordingly.\n\n5.      Assessment of the request for review of a non-conformity\n11.     The AT may provide any information related to the NC, in addition to the submitted on-site\n        assessment report and non-conformity reports, for the purpose of the review. The\n        information shall be submitted within five days of the successful conclusion of the\n        preliminary assessment.\n12.     The secretariat shall, within ten days of successful conclusion of the preliminary\n        assessment, provide the AEP with the request for review of an NC and all supporting\n        documentation received from the AE/DOE, any information from the AT in addition to the\n        submitted on-site assessment report and non-conformity report, and the result of the\n        preliminary assessment conducted by the secretariat.\n13.     The AEP shall consider the request for review of an NC and decide on one of the following\n        options:\n        (a)     Establish an independent panel of experts to conduct a review of the NC;\n        (b)     Not to establish an independent panel and process the case in accordance with\n                section 7 of this appendix.\n14.     If the AEP decides to establish an independent panel, the secretariat shall, within five days\n        of the AEP decision, prepare a list of three experts, selecting from the Accreditation Roster\n        of Experts, the Methodologies Roster of Experts or the Registration and Issuance Team,\n        as candidates for the independent panel, and send the list to the AE/DOE.\n15.     The AE/DOE may object, in writing or by email within five days, to the selection of any\n        expert on the list on the basis of conflict of interest by identifying such conflict of interest.\n16.     If the AE/DOE objects to the selection of an expert, the secretariat shall, within five days,\n        consider modifying the list of experts. If the secretariat considers the objection unjustified,\n        or the AE/DOE does not object to the selection of any expert within the time frame referred\n        to in paragraph 15 of this appendix, the list of experts shall be deemed accepted. If the\n        secretariat considers the objection justified and modifies the list of experts, it shall send\n        the modified list to the AE/DOE within the same five days. After this, the same steps in\n        paragraphs 15 and 16 of this appendix shall repeat until the list of experts is deemed\n        accepted.\n17.     The secretariat shall submit to the AEP the list of experts within five days of the list being\n        deemed accepted. The AEP shall establish the independent panel, by appointing up to\n        two experts from the list submitted by the secretariat, and request the independent panel\n        to prepare a report. The secretariat shall inform the AE/DOE of the names of the appointed\n        experts.\n\n\n\n                                                59 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n18.     Once the AEP establishes the independent panel, the appointed experts shall sign a\n        confidentiality agreement and conflict of interest declaration (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-\n        004).\n19.     The secretariat shall promptly forward the request for review of an NC and all supporting\n        documentation submitted from the AE/DOE to the independent panel. The case shall then\n        be processed in accordance with sections 6 and 7 of this appendix.\n\n6.      Independent panel review of the non-conformity\n20.     The independent panel may, within seven days of receipt of the request for review of an\n        NC and all supporting documentation submitted from the AT and/or the AE/DOE, request\n        further information from the AT and/or the AE/DOE. The AT and/or the AE/DOE shall\n        submit such information or explain why such information cannot be submitted within seven\n        days of receipt of such request. If the AT and/or the AE/DOE fails to do so, the independent\n        panel shall conduct and finalize the review based on the available information in\n        accordance with paragraph 21 of this appendix.\n21.     The independent panel shall review the case based on the documentation provided to it,\n        and by no later than 10 days from the appointment of the experts shall submit an\n        independent review report (form A6.4-FORM-ACCR-021) to the secretariat, including a\n        summary of the views of the AT, the AE/DOE and the independent panel on the NC.\n22.     The secretariat shall submit the independent review report and all related documentation\n        to the AEP, the AT and the AE/DOE within five days of receipt of the independent review\n        report.\n\n7.      Decision by the AEP\n23.     The AEP shall consider the request for review of an NC with all supporting documentation\n        submitted by the AE/DOE, the non-conformity report on the NC prepared by the AT, the\n        independent review report, as applicable, and any other relevant documentation, and\n        decide on one of the following options:\n        (a)     The NC shall be maintained. In this case, the AE/DOE shall provide the AT with a\n                written acceptance of the NC and the accreditation assessment regarding the NC\n                shall resume from the applicable paragraph of this procedure; or\n        (b)     The NC shall be dropped. In this case, the AEP shall request the AT to drop the\n                NC. The secretariat shall reimburse the fee referred to in paragraph 4 of this\n                appendix to the AE/DOE in full.\n24.     The secretariat shall promptly inform the AE/DOE and the AT of the AEP decision.\n25.     The decision of the AEP on the request for review of an NC shall not be subject to further\n        review under this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                              60 of 66\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.2\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 8.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement, at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs) for the\n          mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the Article 6.4\n          mechanism).1 In accordance with the RMPs, a proposed or registered Article 6.4 activity\n          (A6.4 activity) as well as monitored greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or net\n          GHG removals achieved by an A6.4 activity shall be independently assessed by a\n          designated operational entity (DOE) against the requirement set out in the RMPs in order\n          for the activity to be registered or renewed under Article 6.4 mechanism, or for Article 6,\n          paragraph 4, emission reductions to be issued.2\n2.        DOEs play a vital role under the Article 6.4 mechanism by performing validation and\n          verification/certification functions, and the impartiality and competence of DOEs are\n          ensured through the application of the “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation” and the\n          “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”. With the application of the “Procedure: Performance\n          monitoring of the Article 4.6 designated operational entities”, specific measures\n          (e.g. increasing the number of performance assessments, defining the focused areas to\n          be assessed in the central office and/or non-central offices in the forthcoming regular on-\n          site surveillance, and initiating spot-checks) can be initiated based on the results of the\n          performance monitoring of DOEs.\n\n1.2.      Objective\n3.        The objective of the “Procedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated\n          operational entities” (herein after referred to as “this procedure”) is to:\n          (a)     Set out the process and requirements to monitor the performance of, and address\n                  non-compliance by, DOEs in a systematic manner;\n          (b)     Foster the improvement of the performance of DOEs and provide the Supervisory\n                  Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism and the Article 6.4 mechanism Accreditation\n                  Expert Panel (AEP) with tools for informed decision-making on actions in the\n                  accreditation process;\n          (c)     Foster system-wide improvements via identification of issues where guidance or\n                  requirements lack clarity or are non-existent.\n\n2.        Scope\n2.1.      Scope\n4.        This procedure monitors the performance of DOEs through the monitoring, classification\n          and rating of instances of non-compliance identified in the requests for registration and\n\n1\n     Decision 3/CMA.3, annex. Available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25.\n2\n     RMPs, paragraphs 46, 51 and 57.\n\n\n\n                                                  4 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n          issuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs); requests for\n          renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;\n          requests for inclusion of A6.4 component projects (CPs)3; request for renewal of A6.4\n          CPs;4 and requests for approval of post-registration changes (PRCs) of A6.4 projects,\n          A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track submitted by DOEs.5 It provides\n          for the monitoring, classification and categorization of instances of non-compliance into\n          pre-defined subcategories and assigns weight to be used for classifying and grading\n          instances of non-compliances. It establishes a rating system for all DOEs’ instances of\n          non-compliance, comparing the indicators with the agreed thresholds and recommending\n          appropriate actions to be carried out system-wide.\n5.        This procedure is not intended to provide for comparative ranking of DOEs, but to indicate\n          the level of performance and compliance of individual DOEs with the A6.4 accreditation\n          requirements. Its implementation should be complemented with system-wide analysis and\n          improvement.\n6.        The results of the DOE performance monitoring are communicated in the following ways\n          to DOEs, the AEP and the Supervisory Body:\n          (a)     Reporting to DOEs on their performance with the three main objectives:\n                  (i)     Providing feedback on their performance with relevant information that would\n                          allow them to conduct a root-cause analysis of the deficiencies in their\n                          validation/verification work;\n                  (ii)    Informing DOEs of their performance and level of their performance\n                          indicators so that they are aware of whether the thresholds have been\n                          reached or are about to be reached;\n                  (iii)   Informing DOEs of whether any further action has been decided on;\n          (b)     Reporting to the AEP to provide information for its informed decision-making in\n                  accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 accreditation”;\n          (c)     Reporting to the Supervisory Body as the final decision-making body to provide it\n                  with all relevant data for its decision-making in accordance with the A6.4\n                  accreditation procedure as well as to allow the Supervisory Body to make system-\n                  wide improvements.\n\n\n\n\n3\n     In accordance with paragraph 98 of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes\n     of activities”, the assessment of inclusion of CPs is done on a sample basis.\n4\n     In accordance with the paragraph 259 of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for\n     programmes of activities”, the assessment of renewals of the crediting periods of CPs is done on a\n     sample basis.\n5\n     This also includes the verification of the transition of clean development mechanism (CDM) activities to\n     the Article 6.4 mechanism. Therefore, the performance of the CDM DOEs that are allowed to verify and\n     certify the requests for issuance from transitioned activities (as per paragraph 22 of the meeting report\n     on the Supervisory Body at its eighth meeting (https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-\n     sb008.pdf)) is required to be monitored in accordance with this procedure.\n\n\n\n                                                    5 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n2.2.      Applicability\n7.        This procedure is applicable to the performance of DOEs during their entire accreditation\n          term, that is from the date of accreditation by the Supervisory Body until the expiry of\n          accreditation. The provisions of this procedure are not applicable during a suspension of\n          accreditation of DOEs.\n8.        The monitoring of the performance of DOEs is based on the compilation of data through\n          the assessment of the requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and\n          A6.4 PoAs; requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal\n          of A6.4 PoA period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request for renewal of A6.4 CPs;\n          and requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the\n          prior-approval track submitted by DOEs.6\n\n2.3.      Entry into force\n9.        Version 01.0 of this procedure enters into force on 9 October 2024.\n\n3.        Definitions\n10.       The following definitions of terms are used in this document:\n          (a)     DOE performance: how successfully a DOE carries out its validation and\n                  verification functions, as defined in the RMPs for the Article 6.4 mechanism and\n                  the Supervisory Body;\n          (b)     Non-compliance: failure to meet Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements.\n\n4.        Data compilation and classification of information on\n          performance\n4.1.      Classification and grading of instances of non-compliance\n11.       The monitoring of the performance of a DOE is based on the compilation of data through\n          the assessment and review, as applicable, of the requests for registration and issuance\n          for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs; requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4\n          projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs;\n          request for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4\n          PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval track submitted by the DOE.7 The\n          identification of non-compliances, if any, and their classification into predetermined\n          categories is as follows:\n          (a)     Issues related to reporting;\n          (b)     Issues related to failure to follow procedural requirements;\n          (c)     Technical correctness and accuracy issues with regard to failure to identify non-\n                  compliance with Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements;\n\n6\n     See footnote 5.\n7\n     See footnote 5.\n\n\n\n                                                 6 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n          (d)    Other issues, to analyse system-wide gaps and improve classification.\n12.       Appendices 1, 2 and 3 divide the above-identified categories into subcategories for the\n          processes of requests for registration for both A6.4 projects and PoAs; requests for\n          renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA period;\n          requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs and request for renewal of A6.4 CPs (see Appendix 1);\n          requests for issuance of both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs (see Appendix 2); requests for\n          approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval\n          track (see Appendix 3).8 This further subcategorization is provided in order to reduce the\n          level of subjectivity during the identification of instances of non-compliance and to provide\n          sufficient information to DOEs to allow them to understand their performance and\n          appropriately focus their internal improvement efforts.\n13.       Appendices 1, 2 and 3 also include a weighting for the various categories based on the\n          severity and potential impact on the credibility of the accreditation processes. A linear\n          scale using values between 1 (minimum) and 5 (maximum) is used in order to minimize\n          subjectivity during the rating while still allowing sufficient differentiation between the issues\n          based on the severity.\n\n4.2.      Definition of performance indicators\n14.       Based on the classification and weights referred to in paragraphs 11−13 above, the\n          secretariat shall measure, for each DOE, the performance indicators defined in paragraph\n          15 below.\n15.       The secretariat shall calculate, for each of the requests submitted during a given\n          monitoring period as defined in paragraph 25 below, the following performance indicators:\n          (a)     Indicator I1,9 which includes the following two subindicators:\n                  (i)    Indicator I1,CC (rate of incomplete submissions at completeness check (CC)),\n                         calculated as the number of requests concluded as incomplete at\n                         completeness check divided by the number of requests submitted which\n                         have completed the cycle,10 regardless of the number of issues identified in\n                         each incomplete submission:\n                           a.     Indicator I1,CC = number of requests concluded as incomplete at CC /\n                                  number of requests completed;\n                           b.     Indicator I1,CC is to monitor the following types of requests:11\n                                   i.   Requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects\n                                        and A6.4 PoAs;\n\n\n8\n     See footnote 5.\n9\n     The indicators I1,CC and I1,SC shall take into account the number of times a particular request is rejected\n     at CC or substantive check (SC). Therefore, if the same request is rejected at CC or SC multiple times,\n     the re-submission of the same request shall be counted as a different request.\n10\n     A request completes its cycle once a final decision (approval, rejection or withdrawal) is taken in a given\n     monitoring period.\n11\n     See footnote 5.\n\n\n\n                                                     7 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                                   ii.

The withdrawal of a submitted requests for registration or issuance for an A6.4 project or\n          A6.4 PoA; requests for renewal of crediting period of an A6.4 project; requests for renewal\n          of an A6.4 PoA period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; requests for renewal of A6.4\n          CPs, and requests for approval of PRCs to an A6.4 project, A6.4 PoA and A6.4 CPs under\n          the prior-approval track shall be treated as follows:\n          (a)     Such withdrawal of a submitted request shall not be counted in the calculation of\n                  indicators I1,CC and I1,SC;\n\n          (b)     Such withdrawal of a submitted request shall:\n                  (i)    Not be counted in the calculation of indicator I2, if the withdrawal request is\n                         made prior to the respective notification of request for review;\n                  (ii)   Be counted in the calculation of indicator I2, if the withdrawal request is made\n                         after the respective notification of request for review.\n\n4.3.      Data compilation and calculation of indicators\n\n4.3.1. Data compilation and calculation of indicators I1,CC and I1,SC\n18.       Once a DOE submits a request for registration or issuance for an A6.4 project or A6.4\n          PoA; request for renewal of crediting period of an A6.4 project; request for renewal of A6.4\n          PoA period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request renewal of A6.4 CPs; and request\n          for approval of PRCs to an A6.4 project, A6.4 PoA and A6.4 CPs under the prior approval\n          track, the secretariat shall assess the submitted documentation at two stages to determine\n          whether it meets the Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and shall calculate\n          the indicators as follows:\n          (a)     At the CC stage: based on this assessment, the submission shall be deemed\n                  complete or incomplete. Based on the rate of submissions concluded as\n                  incomplete, the indicator I1,CC shall be calculated;\n          (b)     At the SC stage: based on this assessment, the submission shall be deemed\n                  complete or incomplete. Based on the rate of submissions concluded as\n                  incomplete, the indicator I1,SC shall be calculated;\n          (c)     Indicators I1,CC and I1,SC shall be calculated based on paragraph 15(a) above.\n\n\n18\n     See footnote 5.\n\n\n\n                                                   10 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2. Data compilation and calculation of indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and I2,PRC\n19.       Once a DOE submits a request for registration or issuance for an A6.4 project or A6.4\n          PoA; request for renewal of crediting period of an A6.4 project; request for renewal of A6.4\n          PoA period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; request renewal of A6.4 CPs; and a request\n          for approval of PRCs to an A6.4 project, A6.4 PoA or A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval\n          track,19 the secretariat shall assess the submitted documentation at the stage of request\n          for review to determine whether it meets the A6.4 mechanism rules and requirements and\n          shall calculate the indicators as follows:\n          (a)     At the request for review stage: the following steps have to be followed to calculate\n                  indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and I2,PRC:\n                  (i)     Non-compliance issues shall be identified and classified into categories and\n                          subcategories as specified in appendices 1, 2 and 3;\n                  (ii)    Weighting factors for the criticality and historical frequency of each issue\n                          identified shall be attached to each issue. Each request will be given a RPN\n                          value based on the identified weights of individual issues,20 including those\n                          that are closed after the provision of further information/documentation by\n                          the DOE;\n                  (iii)   The weighting of non-compliance issues shall be finalized only after a final\n                          decision on the specific request has been made;\n          (b)     Based on the final weighting of the issues identified, the indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and\n                  I2,PRC shall be calculated based on paragraph 15(b) above.\n\n5.        Definition of thresholds\n5.1.      Thresholds for indicators I1,CC and I1,SC\n20.       The secretariat shall calculate the respective thresholds TH,I1,CC,y and TH,I1,SC,y for\n          indicators I1,CC and I1,SC for a given yth monitoring period using the bootstrapping method\n          as specified in Appendix 4.\n21.       The defined thresholds for DOEs within the yth monitoring period are reached when:\n          (a)     At the CC stage: The threshold is reached when the value of I1,CC is > TH,I1,CC,y;\n          (b)     At the SC stage: The threshold is reached when the value of I1,SC is > TH,I1,SC,y.\n22.       The kth DOE is considered to be in the “green zone” if its indicator I1,CC is equal to or less\n          than TH,I1,CC,y or its indicator I1,SC is equal to or less than TH,I1,SC,y.\n23.       The kth DOE is considered to be in the “red zone” if its indicator I1,CC is more than TH,I1,CC,y\n          or its indicator I1,SC is more than TH,I1,SC,y.\n\n\n19\n     Given that the A6.4 activity cycle procedure for A6.4 projects and A6.4 activity cycle procedure for A6.4\n     PoAs allow all subtypes of PRCs to be submitted together in a single submission, the submission shall\n     be assessed as a whole, covering all subtypes of PRCs.\n20\n     Those issues across the subtypes of PRCs are included in the calculation of the indicator I2,PRC.\n\n\n\n                                                    11 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n5.2.    Thresholds for indicator I2\n24.     For the indicators I2,REG, I2,ISS and I2,PRC, the respective thresholds are identified as follows:\n        (a)     When the number of review cases is higher than or equal to 3 in a given monitoring\n                period, the DOE is considered to be:\n                (i)     In the “green zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is less than 0.6;\n                (ii)    In the “yellow zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal\n                        to 0.6 but less than 0.8;\n                (iii)   In the “red zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal to\n                        0.8;\n        (b)     When the number of review cases is less than 3 in a given monitoring period, the\n                DOE is considered to be:\n                (i)     In the “green zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is less than 6;\n                (ii)    In the “yellow zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal\n                        to 6 but less than 10;\n                (iii)   In the “red zone” if its indicator I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC is higher than or equal to\n                        10.\n\n6.      Monitoring periods\n25.     The performance of DOEs shall be monitored and the performance indicators calculated\n        based on requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs;\n        requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA\n        period; requests for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; requests for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests\n        for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior-approval\n        track submitted during monitoring periods of six months. Each year, a monitoring period\n        starts on 1 January and ends on 30 June, followed by the next monitoring period, which\n        starts on 1 July and ends on 31 December.\n26.     The secretariat shall gradually calculate the indicators at the end of the monitoring period\n        as the requests become finalized.\n\n7.      Reporting on DOE performance\n7.1.    Types of reports\n27.     The secretariat shall prepare the following DOE performance monitoring reports:\n        (a)     A6.4-FORM-ACCR-026: DOE performance monitoring report to DOEs;\n        (b)     A6.4-FORM-ACCR-027: DOE performance monitoring report to the A6.4\n                Supervisory Body and AEP;\n        (c)     A6.4-FORM-ACCR-028: DOE performance monitoring report to the public.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n28.     DOEs may seek clarification from the secretariat on the content of the report to DOEs\n        referred to in paragraph 27(a) above via a dedicated email address. The secretariat shall\n        consider the clarification requests and provide responses.\n29.     In addition to the DOE performance monitoring reports, the secretariat shall prepare a\n        biennial report containing a detailed analysis of the issues arising from the performance\n        of DOEs, in particular any issues that highlight shortcomings in the existing standards or\n        procedures. This report shall provide information to the Supervisory Body and assist it in\n        developing or revising its workplans and those of its panels.\n\n7.2.    Frequency of reporting\n30.     The secretariat shall prepare the DOE performance monitoring reports based on the data\n        related to requests for registration and issuance for both A6.4 projects and A6.4 PoAs;\n        requests for renewal of crediting period of A6.4 projects; requests for renewal of A6.4 PoA\n        period; request for inclusion of A6.4 CPs; requests for renewal of A6.4 CPs; and requests\n        for approval of PRCs to A6.4 projects, A6.4 PoAs and A6.4 CPs under the prior approval-\n        track finalized within seven months of the end of each monitoring period. The secretariat\n        shall issue the DOE performance monitoring report no later than eight months after the\n        end of the same monitoring period.\n\n8.      Actions to be undertaken based on DOE performance\n        monitoring\n31.     Based on the outcome of DOE performance monitoring, different actors shall take a set of\n        actions as described in the paragraphs that follow.\n\n8.1.    Actions to be undertaken by DOEs\n32.     If any of the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE has reached the\n        threshold for the indicators I1,CC and/or I1,SC or is in the yellow zone or red zone of indicators\n        I2,REG, I2,ISS or I2,PRC, the DOE shall undertake a root-cause analysis to identify the causes\n        of the deficiencies in its system and implement appropriate corrective and/or preventive\n        actions to improve its performance.\n33.     The DOE shall be responsible for ensuring that corrective and/or preventive actions\n        identified as a result of the root-cause analysis are adequate and address the identified\n        issues in a systematic manner.\n34.     In addition to the measures as per paragraph 33 above and to ensure prompt action and\n        effective measures at place, the DOEs shall undertake root cause analysis, corrections,\n        corrective actions and preventative actions in accordance with the requirements specified\n        in the “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation”, section 13.6 upon receipt of information of any\n        unsuccessful validation or verification and certification submission by the secretariat and\n        review raised by the Supervisory Body. For all such cases, within 45 days upon receipt of\n        such notification by the secretariat, the DOEs shall submit evidence of all the actions taken\n        to the secretariat through the dedicated e-mail address. The AEP shall consider the\n        actions reported by the DOE at its next meeting and decide further measures.\n\n\n\n\n                                                13 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n8.2.    Actions to be undertaken by the secretariat\n35.     The information contained in the DOE performance monitoring reports shall be used to\n        prepare the workplan of the regular surveillance assessment or the reaccreditation\n        assessment, whichever is to be conducted earlier.\n36.     If the DOE performance monitoring reports corresponding to two consecutive monitoring\n        periods show that a DOE has been in the red zone with regard to performance indicators\n        I1,CC or I1SC, the workplan shall include an instruction to the Assessment Team (AT) to\n        assess whether the DOE has carried out a root-cause analysis as a result of the DOE\n        performance monitoring and that the corrective and/or preventive actions identified were\n        correctly undertaken in the next assessment. The AT shall report the result of this\n        assessment in its assessment report.\n37.     If the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the yellow zone of\n        indicator I2, the workplan shall include an instruction for the AT to assess whether the\n        corrective and/or preventive actions identified were correctly undertaken in the next\n        assessment. The AT shall report the result of this assessment in its assessment report.\n38.     If the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the red zone for indicator\n        I2, the secretariat shall report the cases to the AEP in accordance with paragraph 43 below.\n\n8.3.    Actions to be undertaken by the Article 6.4 Accreditation Expert Panel\n39.     Based on the data reported by the secretariat to the AEP, including instances where the\n        Supervisory Body approved the requests but issues pertaining to the submissions\n        identified by the Supervisory Body indicate a decline in the DOE performance in validation\n        or verification, the AEP, at its next meeting or the subsequent meeting, shall decide on the\n        number and type of performance assessments; the areas to be assessed during the\n        performance assessments, regular on-site surveillance assessments and reaccreditation\n        assessments; and/or any appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory Body supported\n        by proper justification or the applicable provisions specified in the “Procedure: Article 6.4\n        accreditation”. The Supervisory Body shall consider such a recommendation at its next\n        meeting and decide on the course of action.\n\n8.3.1. Number of performance assessments\n40.     If the DOE performance monitoring reports show that a DOE is in the yellow zone for\n        indicator I2,REG or I2,ISS in three consecutive monitoring periods, the AEP shall add one\n        additional performance assessment to the number of planned performance assessments.\n        The nature of this performance assessment shall be defined considering the process that\n        reached the threshold, as follows:\n        (a)     If the threshold is reached as a result of the registration process, a validation\n                performance assessment shall be conducted;\n        (b)     If the threshold is reached as a result of the issuance process, a verification\n                performance assessment shall be conducted.\n41.     These performance assessments, when possible, shall be on the sectoral scopes and/or\n        methodologies where the DOE recurrently fails to perform appropriately according to the\n        results of the DOE performance monitoring reports.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n42.     The AEP shall reduce one performance assessment from those added performance\n        assessments for a DOE in accordance with the “Article 6.4 accreditation procedure” when\n        four consecutive monitoring periods show that the indicator I2,REG or I2,ISS has remained in\n        the green zone.\n\n8.3.2.

Calculation of the threshold for indicators\n\n1.        Calculation of the threshold for indicator I1\n1.        The bootstrap method applied to establish the thresholds for indicators I1,CC and I1,SC\n          comprises the following steps:\n\n          (a)      Observe k subgroups of size n for a total of n*k=N observations (k refers to the kth\n                   designated operational entity (DOE) and n to the number of submissions for each\n                   DOE);\n          (b)      Draw a random sample of size n, with replacement, from the pooled sample of N\n                   observations. This sample, x*1, x*2,..,x*n, is a bootstrap sample;\n\n                                                         *\n          (c)      Compute the sample mean ( X ) from the bootstrap sample drawn in step (b);\n          (d)      Repeat steps (b)–(c) M times;\n\n          (e)      Sort the M bootstrap estimates:\n                                                             X 1* , X 2* ,..., X M* ;\n\n                                                     *\n          (f)      Find the smallest ordered X           such that (1- α)*M values are below it, which is the\n                   threshold for indicators.\n          (g)      It is required that:1\n                   (i)     The size of the random samples in each group (i.e. monitoring periods) is\n                           the number of submissions in each monitoring period;\n                   (ii)    The value of M is 10,000;\n                   (iii)   The value of α is 0.05;\n                   (iv)    The maximum of five years of historical data before the end of the given\n                           monitoring period are applied.\n\n\n\n\n1\n     The value of M (10,000) is selected based on the standard recommended by the scientific community\n     in order to avoid bias between the real population and the bootstrapping result. The value of α (0.05) is\n     the most-used threshold applied in the scientific literature, and the historical data period is to stabilize\n     the indicator. Therefore, the effectiveness of these values in improving the quality of validation and\n     verification processes should be analysed during the inception of the implementation of this procedure\n     for a duration of no less than two years.\n\n\n\n                                                     38 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n2.     Calculation of indicator I2\n2.      Indicator I2 is to calculate the risk priority number (RPN) value, which comprises the\n        following steps:\n        (a)     Weight of frequency for issues of each type raised (Fj):\n                (i)     Count the number of issues of each type identified and rank them from\n                        lowest to highest;\n                (ii)    Transform the rank into a 5-scale system;\n                (iii)   Determine the square root of 5-scale values, which is the value of Fj;\n                (iv)    Note that:\n                         a.    The term “j” indicates issues of each type raised as per the\n                               categorization listed in appendices 1 to 3;\n                         b.    If the number of issues is repeated for two different types, then these\n                               two issues get the minor value on the scale between these two types\n                               of issues;\n                         c.    The frequency of issues of each type raised is derived from at least\n                               five monitoring periods from the past. If the number of request for\n                               review cases is less than 20, the past monitoring periods shall be\n                               extended further to ensure there are at least 20 request for review\n                               cases. This historical frequency is used to establish the RPN mean\n                               value;\n                         d.    If the number of review cases is less than 3 in a given monitoring\n                               period, the value of Fj is defaulted to 1 while calculating the average\n                               RPN value;\n        (b)     Weights of criticality for issues of each type (Cj): Respective weights for\n                classification of issues are defined in appendices 1 to 3;\n        (c)     RPN calculation:\n                (i)     Multiply Fj by Cj with number of issues raised (Nj) to calculate the RPN\n                        value for each request for review cases;\n                (ii)    Calculate the RPN mean value from each request for review RPN values;\n                (iii)   Note that for the indicator I2, if the number of review cases is 2 for the kth\n                        DOE in a given monitoring period (i.e. under the category of less than 3),\n                        the average RPN values of these 2 cases will be used as the indicator I2 for\n                        the kth DOE;\n                (iv)    Note that for the indicator I2, as referred in the footnotes 13, 15 and 17 in\n                        main body of this procedure, where the kth DOE has requests higher than\n                        or equal to 3, but this DOE is the only DOE having the request cases in a\n                        given monitoring period, the average RPN values of those request cases\n                        will be used as the indicator for the kth DOE.\n\n\n\n\n                                                39 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n3.     Example of the indicator I2 by applying the request for issuance\n       submissions\n3.      Table 1 below is an example of the application of provisions specified in section 2 above.\n        There are 30 requests for review raised in a given monitoring period. Based on the\n        respective values of Cj, Fj and Nj from each request for review case, the respective RPN\n        value for each case can be calculated, from which the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.17) can\n        be established.\n\n\n\n\n                                                40 of 44\nA6.4-PROC-ACCR-002\nProcedure: Performance monitoring of the Article 6.4 designated operational entities\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Table 2 below illustrates the conclusion of the performance monitoring outcome as follows:\n          (a)       Both DOE I and DOE A have the number of review cases higher than or equal to\n                    3 during the monitoring period (i.e. 3 and 10 requests for review raised for DOE I\n                    and DOE A, respectively), and therefore both DOE I and DOE A apply the threshold\n                    specified as per paragraph 24(a) of this procedure. The conclusions of the\n                    performance monitoring are as follows:\n                    (i)     All 3 requests for review cases by DOE I have the same RPN value (i.e.\n                            17.18, 17.18 and 17.18), which is above the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.77).\n                            The proportion of cases over the RPN mean value (i.e. 1, which is due to all\n                            3 cases being above the RPN mean value) is higher than 0.8, so the DOE I\n                            is in the red zone;\n                    (ii)    DOE A has 10 request for review cases and only 1 project (i.e. project no. 2),\n                            whose RPN value (i.e. 18.39) is higher than the RPN mean value (i.e. 11.77).\n                            The proportion of cases over the RPN mean value (i.e. 0.1, since there is\n                            only 1 case out of 10 that is higher than the RPN mean value) is lower than\n                            0.6, so DOE A is below the yellow zone;\n          (b)       The other 12 DOEs have less than 3 request for review cases, and therefore the\n                    threshold is defined as per paragraph 24(b) of this procedure. The conclusions of\n                    the performance monitoring are as follows:\n                    (i)     DOE M’s RPN value (i.e. 10) is equal to 10 and therefore it is in the red zone;2\n                    (ii)    DOE L’s RPN value (i.e. 6) is equal to 6 and therefore it is in the yellow zone;\n                    (iii)   DOE N’s RPN value (i.e. 8) is higher than 6 but lower than 10, and therefore\n                            it is in the yellow zone.\n\nTable 2.

The\n       dates and mode (i.e., physical or electronic) of the meetings shall be determined by the\n       secretariat in consultation with the co-chairs of the panel, bearing in mind the needs arising\n       from the panel’s mandates and available resources.\n15.    Agreements by a panel shall be made by consensus, whenever possible. The co-chairs\n       of a panel shall moderate the discussion among the panel members and facilitate them in\n       achieving consensus. If all efforts at reaching consensus on an issue have been\n       exhausted and no agreement has been reached, the range of views or options on the\n\n\n\n                                                   5 of 11\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-003\nTerms of Reference : Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n         issue resulting from the discussion by the panel shall be reflected in its report to the\n         Supervisory Body, and the co-chairs of the panel shall present the range of views or\n         options to the Supervisory Body with clear justification for each.\n16.

The term of service of a member of a panel shall be as decided by the Supervisory Body\n         at the time of their appointment to the panel. The co-chairs of a panel may request\n         outgoing members to attend the first meeting of the new incoming members to ensure the\n         continuity of the work of the panel. A member may re-apply for additional terms. If a\n         member of a panel resigns, or their membership is terminated in accordance with\n         paragraph 30 below, the Supervisory Body shall select a replacement member for the\n         remainder of the term from the applicants marked as “alternatives” for the last call for\n         experts.\n29.      Members of a panel shall abide by the code of conduct of the Supervisory Body, as well\n         as by the provisions related to conflict of interest and transparency of the Supervisory\n         Body,4 taking into account specific confidentiality requirements. They shall shall sign a\n         declaration stating whether they have a pecuniary or financial interest in an issue\n         presented to them as a member of the panel, and if so, refrain from participating in any\n         discussion or decision on the issue. Members of a panel shall not disclose any confidential\n         or proprietary information that comes to their knowledge from serving on a panel. For these\n         purposes, members of a panel shall take a written oath of service before assuming their\n         duties, as provided in appendix 2 below.\n30.      The co-chairs of a panel, may suspend and subsequently recommend to the Supervisory\n         Body the termination of the membership of a particular member on the grounds of, among\n         other things, a breach of the oath referred to in paragraph 29 above, failure to attend two\n         consecutive meetings of the panel without proper justification, or not fulfilling the duties of\n         a member, in particular not providing work inputs of the required quality and on time.

The co-chairs of a panel shall evaluate the performance of the secretariat supporting the\n         work of the panel and provide feedback to the secretariat.\n33.      Members of a panel shall attend each meeting of the panel.

Failure to do so without proper justification shall be treated as an\n         absence from the meeting without proper justification. Further, the absent member shall\n         provide their input on the agenda items considered at that particular meeting via electronic\n         means.\n34.      Members of a panel are expected to commit to the following:\n         (a)     Attend expert panel meetings, requiring a time commitment of up to 55 working\n                 days per year, including travel time, plus up to 40 working days per year for\n                 preparation;5\n         (b)     Participate in other relevant activities of the panel, requiring a time commitment of\n                 up to 10 working days per year.\n35.

In addition to the co-chairs of a panel, the Supervisory Body may also elect its members\n         or alternate members to support meetings of a panel, as appropriate.\n21.      The Supervisory Body shall elect the co-chairs, and any additional members or alternate\n         members referred to in paragraph 20 above, to each of its panels at its first meeting of\n         each calendar year.\n22.      If one or both the co-chairs of a panel resign, or otherwise ceases to be able to carry out\n         his or her their functions, or ceases to be a member or alternate member of the\n         Supervisory Body, the Supervisory Body shall elect new co-chairs of the panel from among\n         its members or alternate members for the remainder of the term, taking into account the\n         consideration of regional and gender balance.\n23.      If one of the co-chairs of a panel is not able to serve in its capacity for a meeting, the other\n         co-chair shall serve as the chair for that meeting. If neither are able to serve in their\n         respective capacities, one of the Supervisory Body members or alternate members\n         elected to support the meetings of the panel, if applicable, shall serve as the chair for that\n         meeting, subject to their availability. Otherwise, the panel shall elect a member from its\n         members present at the meeting to serve as the chair for that meeting.\n24.

The co-chairs of a panel shall, without prejudice, convey the mandate or guidance from\n         the Supervisory Body, including the priority in setting the agenda of the meetings of the\n         panel, where applicable, and at all times shall remain neutral in the discussion within the\n         panel. The co-chairs of a panel may express their own views to the Supervisory Body in\n         their capacity as a member or alternate member of the Supervisory Body. Before doing\n         so, they shall share their views with the panel and always clearly distinguish between\n         personal views and those of the panel.\n26.      The co-chairs of a panel may consult supporting members referred to in paragraph 20\n         above at any time in fulfilling their role as the co-chairs.

The term of service of a member of a panel shall be as decided by the Supervisory Body\n         at the time of their appointment to the panel. The co-chairs of a panel may request\n         outgoing members to attend the first meeting of the new incoming members to ensure the\n         continuity of the work of the panel. A member may re-apply for additional terms. If a\n         member of a panel resigns, or their membership is terminated in accordance with\n         paragraph 30 below, the Supervisory Body shall select a replacement member for the\n         remainder of the term from the applicants marked as “alternatives” for the last call for\n         experts.\n29.      Members of a panel shall abide by the code of conduct of the Supervisory Body, as well\n         as by the provisions related to conflict of interest and transparency of the Supervisory\n         Body,4 taking into account specific confidentiality requirements. They shall shall sign a\n         declaration stating whether they have a pecuniary or financial interest in an issue\n         presented to them as a member of the panel, and if so, refrain from participating in any\n         discussion or decision on the issue. Members of a panel shall not disclose any confidential\n         or proprietary information that comes to their knowledge from serving on a panel. For these\n         purposes, members of a panel shall take a written oath of service before assuming their\n         duties, as provided in appendix 2 below.\n30.      The co-chairs of a panel, may suspend and subsequently recommend to the Supervisory\n         Body the termination of the membership of a particular member on the grounds of, among\n         other things, a breach of the oath referred to in paragraph 29 above, failure to attend two\n         consecutive meetings of the panel without proper justification, or not fulfilling the duties of\n         a member, in particular not providing work inputs of the required quality and on time.

The co-chairs of a panel, with the support of the secretariat, shall evaluate the\n         performance of members of the panel in accordance with the “Procedure: Selection and\n         performance evaluation of members of panels under the Supervisory Body” and provide\n         feedback to them. The evaluation shall be used as one of the bases for consideration of\n         reselection of members for further terms or for the suspension of membership in\n         accordance with paragraph 30 above.\n32.      The co-chairs of a panel shall evaluate the performance of the secretariat supporting the\n         work of the panel and provide feedback to the secretariat.\n33.      Members of a panel shall attend each meeting of the panel. If, due to circumstances\n         beyond their control, a member is unable to attend a meeting fully or partially, they shall,\n         through the secretariat, immediately inform the co-chairs of the panel of this fact, together\n         with proper justification. Failure to do so without proper justification shall be treated as an\n         absence from the meeting without proper justification. Further, the absent member shall\n         provide their input on the agenda items considered at that particular meeting via electronic\n         means.\n34.      Members of a panel are expected to commit to the following:\n         (a)     Attend expert panel meetings, requiring a time commitment of up to 55 working\n                 days per year, including travel time, plus up to 40 working days per year for\n                 preparation;5\n         (b)     Participate in other relevant activities of the panel, requiring a time commitment of\n                 up to 10 working days per year.\n35.      Considering the demand of the respective area of work, the Supervisory Body may place\n         a panel in abeyance at any time.\n\n7.2.     Remuneration\n36.      Travel costs, daily subsistence allowance, and a daily fee shall be paid to members of a\n         panel attending a meeting of the panel in accordance with United Nations rules and\n         regulations.\n37.      If a member of a panel is requested to carry out a specific task between meetings, the\n         member shall be remunerated for the task undertaken by means of payment of daily fees,\n         subject to the provision of the input being of good quality and on time. The daily fee shall\n         be determined in accordance with United Nations rules and regulations.

Selection process\n10.      The selection of expert panel members shall be either from the existing rosters of experts\n         or through a specific call for experts. If from the existing rosters, the secretariat shall\n         confirm with experts in the roster whether they are interested in serving as panel members.\n11.      The Supervisory Body may consider launching a call for experts for renewal of\n         membership within the panel or whenever specific expertise is needed or sought.\n12.      The selection process, where applicable, includes:\n         (a)      The launch of the call for applications;\n         (b)      Eligibility checks;\n         (c)      Screening process (interviews, performance evaluation);\n         (d)      Consultation with the co-chairs of the respective panel or assigned members;\n         (e)      Shortlisting; and\n         (f)      Selection by the Supervisory Body.\n\n5.2.1. Launch of call for applications\n13.      When the Supervisory Body decides to open a call for experts, the secretariat shall launch\n         the call for a minimum period of 15 days. The secretariat shall ensure that the\n         announcement reaches a wide audience and is well distributed across all regions.\n14.      The secretariat shall ensure the following information is available to applicants at the time\n         of the call:\n         (a)      General information on the selection process and timelines;\n         (b)      The ToR, which includes, inter alia, information on competence requirements,\n                  modalities of work, code of conduct of the Supervisory Body and remuneration for\n                  panel members;\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n       (c)     Application questionnaire related to demonstration of competence requirements.\n15.    Experts interested in being appointed as members of any of the panels, and existing panel\n       members who wish to reapply for a new term, shall respond to the call for applications by\n       the deadline specified on the call page to be considered.\n\n5.2.2. Eligibility check\n16.    The secretariat shall undertake an eligibility check of applicants. The following items\n       constitute the eligibility criteria:\n       (a)     Submission of a completed P.11 form and a completed application questionnaire\n               by the deadline specified in the call for applications;\n       (b)     Confirmation of agreement to all provisions of the ToR;\n       (c)     Fulfilment of competence requirements as presented in table 1 above.\n17.    Any failure to agree to the ToR and the code of conduct provisions, late submission of a\n       completed P.11 form and/or application form, or non-fulfilment of the competence\n       requirements shall result in disqualification.\n\n5.2.3. Screening process\n18.    An application form that is only partially completed shall be evaluated based on the\n       information provided. In case of any discrepancies between the information provided in\n       the submitted application form and the P.11 form, the most conservative response shall\n       be regarded as the applicable response.\n19.    The further process for evaluation of applicants depends on whether an applicant is\n       external (i.e. new) or an existing panel member who has reapplied. External applicants\n       may be invited to participate in an interview via telephone or internet-based call to assess\n       their competencies, whereas re-applying members shall be considered to have fulfilled\n       the competence requirements and therefore are evaluated based on the extent of\n       fulfilment of their role as appointed members (see section 6 below).\n\n5.2.3.1.       External applicants – interviews\n20.    The secretariat shall prepare a list of applicants for interviews (interview list) based on the\n       criteria referred to in paragraph 21 below and in consultation with the relevant panel co-\n       chairs (see section 5.2.4 below). The secretariat shall seek to ensure that applicants\n       represent a fair regional balance, including at least three applicants from each region,\n       where possible.\n21.    The criteria for inclusion of external applicants in the interview list are as follows:\n       (a)     Eligibility;\n       (b)     Extent and depth of technical competencies;\n       (c)     Relevance of technical competencies for the panel’s workplan (e.g. special skills);\n       (d)     Regional affiliation;\n       (e)     Gender.\n\n\n\n                                               6 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n22.    In case of applications for multiple panels, and in accordance with the composition\n       requirements of the AEP and MEP as specified in appendix 1 of the ToR, applicants may\n       be interviewed for the multiple panels in one interview.\n23.    The interviews shall be conducted by interview panels consisting of cross-unit secretariat\n       staff with process and technical skills. Each interview shall last no longer than 45 minutes\n       per applicant.\n24.    The interview panels shall use a standardized set of interview questions for each panel or\n       working group and record the results of the interviews in the form of numeric values.\n25.    Applicants’ competencies shall be evaluated based on the parameters listed in table 1\n       above with specific attention to oral and general communication skills in English\n       (satisfactory/non-satisfactory), the type (technical/academic/political) of previous work,\n       specific attributes as a member (value-added) and other issues (e.g. multiple\n       applications).\n26.    For applicants with similar skills, preference shall be given to an applicant whose\n       membership will contribute to balanced regional representation and/or gender balance.\n\n5.2.3.2.       Reapplying members – performance evaluation\n27.    Reapplying members’ applications shall be evaluated based on the performance\n       evaluation, as referred to in section 6 below, of the extent of fulfilment of their\n       responsibilities as appointed members.\n28.    For consideration in the selection process, members’ performance results shall, as a\n       minimum, cover two full meetings, and for members of the MEP, the assignment of at least\n       two cases. If a member has been absent and only participated in one meeting, the matter\n       shall be forwarded to the Supervisory Body to determine the appropriate modality for\n       handling it. Special circumstances such as maternity or extended sick leave should not\n       negatively impact the performance evaluation of a member.\n29.    The results of a reapplying member’s performance evaluation shall clearly indicate the\n       member’s performance according to above average, average or below average.\n30.    The performance evaluation scores shall generally be treated as indicative. For the\n       selection process, this implies that special skills may, for example, result in a\n       recommendation for appointment despite a below-average performance evaluation score;\n       similarly, a well performing member’s set of skills may be considered superfluous in the\n       context of the annual workplan for the panel or working group and therefore may not result\n       in a recommendation for appointment.\n\n5.2.4. Consultation and approval\n31.    The secretariat shall consult with the co-chairs of the respective panels or working group\n       throughout the process and seek agreement from them on the following documents\n       relevant to the selection process:\n       (a)     Final performance evaluations of reapplying members;\n       (b)     Interview list of external applicants;\n\n\n\n\n                                               7 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n       (c)     Shortlist of applicants recommended for appointment and applicants as\n               alternatives to the recommended ones for the Supervisory Body’s consideration.\n32.    The presentation of the shortlist for the Supervisory Body’s consideration shall include\n       information on the consultation processes and clearly indicate whether the agreement was\n       reached on the matters referred to in paragraph 31(a), 3131(b) and 31(c) above and, in\n       the event that the agreement was not reached, reflect the different views for the\n       Supervisory Body’s consideration.\n33.    The co-chairs of the respective panel or working group shall be provided with the following\n       information:\n       (a)     Full list of applicants, clearly indicating:\n               (i)     Eligible and non-eligible applicants;\n               (ii)    External applicants invited for interviews;\n               (iii)   Applicants who are reapplying members;\n               (iv)    Applicants proposed for inclusion in the longlist referred to in paragraph 35\n                       below;\n               (v)     Applicants proposed for inclusion in the shortlist referred to in paragraph 36\n                       below;\n       (b)     Performance evaluation scores (see section 6 below);\n       (c)     P.11 forms of shortlisted applicants.\n34.    The co-chairs of the respective panel shall also have access to the following information,\n       if they so wish:\n       (a)     Interview reports;\n       (b)     P.11 forms of all applicants.\n\n5.2.5. Shortlisting\n35.    The secretariat shall prepare a longlist, clearly indicating regional affiliation and gender,\n       which includes:\n       (a)     External applicants whose interview results indicate that they deserve further\n               consideration;\n       (b)     All reapplying members who meet performance benchmarks.\n36.    Based on the longlist, the secretariat shall prepare a first draft of a shortlist for\n       consideration and input by the co-chairs of the respective panel or working group, clearly\n       indicating regional affiliation and key words related to skills and value-added. The shortlist\n       shall include:\n       (a)     For the AEP\n               (i)     A total of five applicants recommended for appointment;\n               (ii)    A maximum of three applicants as alternatives;\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n       (b)     For the MEP:\n               (i)    A total of 14 applicants recommended for appointment;\n               (ii)   A maximum of six applicants as alternatives.\n37.    The inclusion of applicants in the shortlist or their exclusion from it shall be based on the\n       consideration of:\n       (a)     Overall composition of skills required in the context of the annual workplans;\n       (b)     Benefits of continuity in membership (i.e. added value of the continuity of the\n               specific set of skills of reapplying members to the composition of the group) and\n               benefits of access to new skills and experience;\n       (c)     Regional representation and gender balance.\n38.    The shortlist shall be circulated to the Supervisory Body as a confidential annex to the\n       annotations for the next Supervisory Body meeting and presented during the Supervisory\n       Body meeting by the co-chairs, supported by the secretariat. The shortlist shall be\n       accompanied by the full list of applicants.\n\n5.2.6. Appointment of membership\n39.    The Supervisory Body shall consider the shortlist and select members for each panel or\n       working group. The selected and outgoing members’ names shall be recorded in the\n       corresponding Supervisory Body meeting report.\n40.    The secretariat shall notify each applicant of their application status, prioritizing the\n       notifications to reapplying members.\n41.    Selected members shall inform the secretariat at the earliest possible time of any\n       conflicting commitments and shall provide justification for any expected absence, including\n       partial absence, at a particular meeting. Proper justifications include:\n       (a)     Hospitalization/sickness or emergencies in the immediate family;\n       (b)     Previously planned professional commitments that present a time conflict with the\n               meeting.\n42.    The secretariat shall update the public website dedicated to the panels and working groups\n       with the newly appointed members’ names in accordance with the start or end of their term\n       of service.\n43.    The co-chairs of a panel or working group may request specific outgoing members to\n       attend the first meeting for incoming members to ensure the continuity of the work of the\n       panel/ or working group. Such a request may be made if the outgoing member has been\n       assigned work which is placed on the agenda for the next meeting.\n44.    During the transition period of outgoing and incoming members, newly appointed\n       members shall be treated as observers until the first meeting of the panel or working group\n       for the incoming members.

Evaluation and reporting of performance of members of\n        panels and working groups\n 6.1.   Purposes\n 48.    The performance evaluation of the panel members, would be conducted in accordance\n        with the ToR, is used for the following three purposes:\n        (a)     Provide input to the process for selection of members of panels;\n        (b)     Provide feedback from the co-chairs of panels to the panel members on their\n                performance;\n        (c)     Report on the performance of the members of panels to the Supervisory Body.\n\n 6.2.   Performance evaluation\n 49.    Members’ performance shall be evaluated based on the fulfilment of their responsibilities\n        that are derived directly from the roles specified in the ToR.\n 50.    The criterion for fulfilment of responsibilities is the active provision of input to all the\n        subcomponents of these roles, and the fulfilment of responsibilities as a member shall be\n        evaluated based on their performance.\n 51.    Performance evaluation of members shall be undertaken for each meeting (physical or\n        electronic), including its pre- and post-meeting tasks.\n 52.    The results of the performance evaluation of individual members shall be treated as\n        confidential.\n 53.    The secretariat shall ensure that the performance evaluations are undertaken in a\n        standardized manner by using standard evaluation forms and a reference sheet included\n        in Appendix 1 to this document.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n54.    The co-chairs of the respective panel or working group and the secretariat shall evaluate\n       the performance of its individual members.\n55.    Members’ performance shall be evaluated in the following two areas of activities:\n       (a)     Inter-meeting work (evaluated for each case to which individual members have\n               been assigned);\n       (b)     In-meeting activity.\n56.    The performance in inter-meeting work is evaluated as a function of the level of complexity\n       of the assigned case, the quality of input, and the timeliness of provision of input.\n57.    The performance in in-meeting activity is evaluated as a function of level of activity and\n       the quality of inputs during the meetings.\n58.    The results of the performance evaluations shall be recorded as numeric values and\n       compiled in a spreadsheet for tracking, analysis and reporting purposes. The results shall\n       be accompanied by information on members’ adherence to the code of conduct of the\n       Supervisory Body, including the declaration of no conflict of interest.\n\n6.3.   Performance reporting\n59.    The secretariat shall compile the members’ individual performance evaluation results mid-\n       term, with the aim of supporting the process of providing feedback on the performance to\n       the members. The modality for provision of feedback to individual members shall be at the\n       prerogative of the respective co-chairs.\n60.    The aim of such feedback shall be to allow a member to improve their performance. Where\n       the performance evaluation has identified a need for improvement, the feedback may\n       include, inter alia, an encouragement to the member to be more proactive during\n       discussions, improve the quality and timeliness of inputs, ensure a higher level of\n       preparedness for in-meeting discussions, or more actively share his or her expertise with\n       the rest of the panel or working group members.\n61.    Where the performance evaluation has identified an unsatisfactory level of performance\n       of a member with no prospect of improvement, the provisions on suspension and\n       subsequent termination of membership of the member in the ToR shall apply.\n62.    If the secretariat receives a query from a member in response to the feedback on their\n       performance, the secretariat shall process it in consultation with the co-chairs of the\n       respective panel or working group.\n63.    The secretariat shall report to the Supervisory Body on the performance of the panel\n       members by preparing a consolidated performance report. This report shall include data\n       on the performance of each member.\n64.    The reporting shall be undertaken prior to the launch of the call for the selection of new\n       panel and working group members in order to allow the Supervisory Body to consider the\n       scope for the launch of the call for new members. The report shall be treated as\n       confidential.\n\n\n\n\n                                               11 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1.

Selection process\n10.      The selection of expert panel members shall be either from the existing rosters of experts\n         or through a specific call for experts. If from the existing rosters, the secretariat shall\n         confirm with experts in the roster whether they are interested in serving as panel members.\n11.      The Supervisory Body may consider launching a call for experts for renewal of\n         membership within the panel or whenever specific expertise is needed or sought.\n12.      The selection process, where applicable, includes:\n         (a)      The launch of the call for applications;\n         (b)      Eligibility checks;\n         (c)      Screening process (interviews, performance evaluation);\n         (d)      Consultation with the co-chairs of the respective panel or assigned members;\n         (e)      Shortlisting; and\n         (f)      Selection by the Supervisory Body.\n\n5.2.1. Launch of call for applications\n13.      When the Supervisory Body decides to open a call for experts, the secretariat shall launch\n         the call for a minimum period of 15 days. The secretariat shall ensure that the\n         announcement reaches a wide audience and is well distributed across all regions.\n14.      The secretariat shall ensure the following information is available to applicants at the time\n         of the call:\n         (a)      General information on the selection process and timelines;\n         (b)      The ToR, which includes, inter alia, information on competence requirements,\n                  modalities of work, code of conduct of the Supervisory Body and remuneration for\n                  panel members;\n\n\n\n\n                                                     5 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n       (c)     Application questionnaire related to demonstration of competence requirements.\n15.    Experts interested in being appointed as members of any of the panels, and existing panel\n       members who wish to reapply for a new term, shall respond to the call for applications by\n       the deadline specified on the call page to be considered.\n\n5.2.2. Eligibility check\n16.    The secretariat shall undertake an eligibility check of applicants. The following items\n       constitute the eligibility criteria:\n       (a)     Submission of a completed P.11 form and a completed application questionnaire\n               by the deadline specified in the call for applications;\n       (b)     Confirmation of agreement to all provisions of the ToR;\n       (c)     Fulfilment of competence requirements as presented in table 1 above.\n17.    Any failure to agree to the ToR and the code of conduct provisions, late submission of a\n       completed P.11 form and/or application form, or non-fulfilment of the competence\n       requirements shall result in disqualification.\n\n5.2.3. Screening process\n18.    An application form that is only partially completed shall be evaluated based on the\n       information provided. In case of any discrepancies between the information provided in\n       the submitted application form and the P.11 form, the most conservative response shall\n       be regarded as the applicable response.\n19.    The further process for evaluation of applicants depends on whether an applicant is\n       external (i.e. new) or an existing panel member who has reapplied. External applicants\n       may be invited to participate in an interview via telephone or internet-based call to assess\n       their competencies, whereas re-applying members shall be considered to have fulfilled\n       the competence requirements and therefore are evaluated based on the extent of\n       fulfilment of their role as appointed members (see section 6 below).\n\n5.2.3.1.       External applicants – interviews\n20.    The secretariat shall prepare a list of applicants for interviews (interview list) based on the\n       criteria referred to in paragraph 21 below and in consultation with the relevant panel co-\n       chairs (see section 5.2.4 below). The secretariat shall seek to ensure that applicants\n       represent a fair regional balance, including at least three applicants from each region,\n       where possible.\n21.    The criteria for inclusion of external applicants in the interview list are as follows:\n       (a)     Eligibility;\n       (b)     Extent and depth of technical competencies;\n       (c)     Relevance of technical competencies for the panel’s workplan (e.g. special skills);\n       (d)     Regional affiliation;\n       (e)     Gender.\n\n\n\n                                               6 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n22.    In case of applications for multiple panels, and in accordance with the composition\n       requirements of the AEP and MEP as specified in appendix 1 of the ToR, applicants may\n       be interviewed for the multiple panels in one interview.\n23.    The interviews shall be conducted by interview panels consisting of cross-unit secretariat\n       staff with process and technical skills. Each interview shall last no longer than 45 minutes\n       per applicant.\n24.    The interview panels shall use a standardized set of interview questions for each panel or\n       working group and record the results of the interviews in the form of numeric values.\n25.    Applicants’ competencies shall be evaluated based on the parameters listed in table 1\n       above with specific attention to oral and general communication skills in English\n       (satisfactory/non-satisfactory), the type (technical/academic/political) of previous work,\n       specific attributes as a member (value-added) and other issues (e.g. multiple\n       applications).\n26.    For applicants with similar skills, preference shall be given to an applicant whose\n       membership will contribute to balanced regional representation and/or gender balance.\n\n5.2.3.2.       Reapplying members – performance evaluation\n27.    Reapplying members’ applications shall be evaluated based on the performance\n       evaluation, as referred to in section 6 below, of the extent of fulfilment of their\n       responsibilities as appointed members.\n28.    For consideration in the selection process, members’ performance results shall, as a\n       minimum, cover two full meetings, and for members of the MEP, the assignment of at least\n       two cases. If a member has been absent and only participated in one meeting, the matter\n       shall be forwarded to the Supervisory Body to determine the appropriate modality for\n       handling it. Special circumstances such as maternity or extended sick leave should not\n       negatively impact the performance evaluation of a member.\n29.    The results of a reapplying member’s performance evaluation shall clearly indicate the\n       member’s performance according to above average, average or below average.\n30.    The performance evaluation scores shall generally be treated as indicative. For the\n       selection process, this implies that special skills may, for example, result in a\n       recommendation for appointment despite a below-average performance evaluation score;\n       similarly, a well performing member’s set of skills may be considered superfluous in the\n       context of the annual workplan for the panel or working group and therefore may not result\n       in a recommendation for appointment.\n\n5.2.4. Consultation and approval\n31.    The secretariat shall consult with the co-chairs of the respective panels or working group\n       throughout the process and seek agreement from them on the following documents\n       relevant to the selection process:\n       (a)     Final performance evaluations of reapplying members;\n       (b)     Interview list of external applicants;\n\n\n\n\n                                               7 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n       (c)     Shortlist of applicants recommended for appointment and applicants as\n               alternatives to the recommended ones for the Supervisory Body’s consideration.\n32.    The presentation of the shortlist for the Supervisory Body’s consideration shall include\n       information on the consultation processes and clearly indicate whether the agreement was\n       reached on the matters referred to in paragraph 31(a), 3131(b) and 31(c) above and, in\n       the event that the agreement was not reached, reflect the different views for the\n       Supervisory Body’s consideration.\n33.    The co-chairs of the respective panel or working group shall be provided with the following\n       information:\n       (a)     Full list of applicants, clearly indicating:\n               (i)     Eligible and non-eligible applicants;\n               (ii)    External applicants invited for interviews;\n               (iii)   Applicants who are reapplying members;\n               (iv)    Applicants proposed for inclusion in the longlist referred to in paragraph 35\n                       below;\n               (v)     Applicants proposed for inclusion in the shortlist referred to in paragraph 36\n                       below;\n       (b)     Performance evaluation scores (see section 6 below);\n       (c)     P.11 forms of shortlisted applicants.\n34.    The co-chairs of the respective panel shall also have access to the following information,\n       if they so wish:\n       (a)     Interview reports;\n       (b)     P.11 forms of all applicants.\n\n5.2.5. Shortlisting\n35.    The secretariat shall prepare a longlist, clearly indicating regional affiliation and gender,\n       which includes:\n       (a)     External applicants whose interview results indicate that they deserve further\n               consideration;\n       (b)     All reapplying members who meet performance benchmarks.\n36.    Based on the longlist, the secretariat shall prepare a first draft of a shortlist for\n       consideration and input by the co-chairs of the respective panel or working group, clearly\n       indicating regional affiliation and key words related to skills and value-added. The shortlist\n       shall include:\n       (a)     For the AEP\n               (i)     A total of five applicants recommended for appointment;\n               (ii)    A maximum of three applicants as alternatives;\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n       (b)     For the MEP:\n               (i)    A total of 14 applicants recommended for appointment;\n               (ii)   A maximum of six applicants as alternatives.\n37.    The inclusion of applicants in the shortlist or their exclusion from it shall be based on the\n       consideration of:\n       (a)     Overall composition of skills required in the context of the annual workplans;\n       (b)     Benefits of continuity in membership (i.e. added value of the continuity of the\n               specific set of skills of reapplying members to the composition of the group) and\n               benefits of access to new skills and experience;\n       (c)     Regional representation and gender balance.\n38.    The shortlist shall be circulated to the Supervisory Body as a confidential annex to the\n       annotations for the next Supervisory Body meeting and presented during the Supervisory\n       Body meeting by the co-chairs, supported by the secretariat. The shortlist shall be\n       accompanied by the full list of applicants.\n\n5.2.6. Appointment of membership\n39.    The Supervisory Body shall consider the shortlist and select members for each panel or\n       working group. The selected and outgoing members’ names shall be recorded in the\n       corresponding Supervisory Body meeting report.\n40.    The secretariat shall notify each applicant of their application status, prioritizing the\n       notifications to reapplying members.\n41.    Selected members shall inform the secretariat at the earliest possible time of any\n       conflicting commitments and shall provide justification for any expected absence, including\n       partial absence, at a particular meeting. Proper justifications include:\n       (a)     Hospitalization/sickness or emergencies in the immediate family;\n       (b)     Previously planned professional commitments that present a time conflict with the\n               meeting.\n42.    The secretariat shall update the public website dedicated to the panels and working groups\n       with the newly appointed members’ names in accordance with the start or end of their term\n       of service.\n43.    The co-chairs of a panel or working group may request specific outgoing members to\n       attend the first meeting for incoming members to ensure the continuity of the work of the\n       panel/ or working group. Such a request may be made if the outgoing member has been\n       assigned work which is placed on the agenda for the next meeting.\n44.    During the transition period of outgoing and incoming members, newly appointed\n       members shall be treated as observers until the first meeting of the panel or working group\n       for the incoming members. Observers may be granted access to the relevant extranet of\n       the panel or working group upon receipt of a signed oath of service.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9 of 13\n A6.4-PROC-GOV-004\n Procedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\n Version 03.0\n\n\n\n\n 45.    New members shall be briefed by the secretariat on their roles and responsibilities,\n        performance monitoring criteria, and sources of information, either electronically and/or at\n        the first meeting of the panel or working group that they attend.\n 46.    New members shall provide the secretariat with:\n        (a)     A scanned copy of their passport;\n        (b)     Bank details;\n        (c)     Signed oath of service in accordance with the form included in Appendix 2 to the\n                ToR;\n        (d)     Signed declaration on engagement with the United Nations system as an\n                employee or consultant;\n        (e)     Curriculum vitae as per the Supervisory Body’s template.\n 47.    Members shall be assigned an index number by the secretariat no later than six weeks\n        before their first scheduled meeting.\n\n6.      Evaluation and reporting of performance of members of\n        panels and working groups\n 6.1.   Purposes\n 48.    The performance evaluation of the panel members, would be conducted in accordance\n        with the ToR, is used for the following three purposes:\n        (a)     Provide input to the process for selection of members of panels;\n        (b)     Provide feedback from the co-chairs of panels to the panel members on their\n                performance;\n        (c)     Report on the performance of the members of panels to the Supervisory Body.\n\n 6.2.   Performance evaluation\n 49.    Members’ performance shall be evaluated based on the fulfilment of their responsibilities\n        that are derived directly from the roles specified in the ToR.\n 50.    The criterion for fulfilment of responsibilities is the active provision of input to all the\n        subcomponents of these roles, and the fulfilment of responsibilities as a member shall be\n        evaluated based on their performance.\n 51.    Performance evaluation of members shall be undertaken for each meeting (physical or\n        electronic), including its pre- and post-meeting tasks.\n 52.    The results of the performance evaluation of individual members shall be treated as\n        confidential.\n 53.    The secretariat shall ensure that the performance evaluations are undertaken in a\n        standardized manner by using standard evaluation forms and a reference sheet included\n        in Appendix 1 to this document.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\n54.    The co-chairs of the respective panel or working group and the secretariat shall evaluate\n       the performance of its individual members.\n55.    Members’ performance shall be evaluated in the following two areas of activities:\n       (a)     Inter-meeting work (evaluated for each case to which individual members have\n               been assigned);\n       (b)     In-meeting activity.\n56.    The performance in inter-meeting work is evaluated as a function of the level of complexity\n       of the assigned case, the quality of input, and the timeliness of provision of input.\n57.    The performance in in-meeting activity is evaluated as a function of level of activity and\n       the quality of inputs during the meetings.\n58.    The results of the performance evaluations shall be recorded as numeric values and\n       compiled in a spreadsheet for tracking, analysis and reporting purposes. The results shall\n       be accompanied by information on members’ adherence to the code of conduct of the\n       Supervisory Body, including the declaration of no conflict of interest.\n\n6.3.   Performance reporting\n59.    The secretariat shall compile the members’ individual performance evaluation results mid-\n       term, with the aim of supporting the process of providing feedback on the performance to\n       the members. The modality for provision of feedback to individual members shall be at the\n       prerogative of the respective co-chairs.\n60.    The aim of such feedback shall be to allow a member to improve their performance. Where\n       the performance evaluation has identified a need for improvement, the feedback may\n       include, inter alia, an encouragement to the member to be more proactive during\n       discussions, improve the quality and timeliness of inputs, ensure a higher level of\n       preparedness for in-meeting discussions, or more actively share his or her expertise with\n       the rest of the panel or working group members.\n61.    Where the performance evaluation has identified an unsatisfactory level of performance\n       of a member with no prospect of improvement, the provisions on suspension and\n       subsequent termination of membership of the member in the ToR shall apply.\n62.    If the secretariat receives a query from a member in response to the feedback on their\n       performance, the secretariat shall process it in consultation with the co-chairs of the\n       respective panel or working group.\n63.    The secretariat shall report to the Supervisory Body on the performance of the panel\n       members by preparing a consolidated performance report. This report shall include data\n       on the performance of each member.\n64.    The reporting shall be undertaken prior to the launch of the call for the selection of new\n       panel and working group members in order to allow the Supervisory Body to consider the\n       scope for the launch of the call for new members. The report shall be treated as\n       confidential.\n\n\n\n\n                                               11 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-004\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of members of Article 6.4 expert panels\nVersion 03.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1.

The secretariat shall conduct an impartiality analysis on an annual basis encompassing\n       all experts on the ARoE. The secretariat shall use the outcomes of the analysis to establish\n       measures to prevent the risk of experts on the ARoE not acting impartially in accreditation\n       assessments.\n17.    The secretariat shall notify the AEP on the mitigation measures established.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6 of 16\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-005\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation\nroster of experts\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n18.      Services provided by the experts shall be governed by the applicable version of the\n         relevant procedure and related documents. In providing services, the experts shall operate\n         under the guidance of the Supervisory Body, the AEP and the secretariat and shall:\n         (a)     Ensure that the services are rendered to the requisite level of quality with all due\n                 care, skill and diligence within the time frame specified in the relevant procedure.\n                 The work shall be prepared using the applicable version of the template relevant\n                 to the A6.4 mechanism accreditation procedure, if applicable;\n         (b)     Treat with strict confidentiality any non-public information that they receive in the\n                 course of providing services.\n\n5.3.     Qualification criteria\n19.      The experts on the ARoE shall fulfil the minimum qualification requirements as specified\n         in the ToR and the detailed criteria for each of the categories of status, as elaborated in\n         the Appendix 2 to this procedure.\n\n5.4.     Selection process\n20.      The secretariat shall launch a call for experts on the UNFCCC Article 6.4 website every\n         two years for the selection of experts on the ARoE. Applications shall include, in addition\n         to the United Nations Personal History Form (P.11), detailed working and/or scientific and\n         technical experience. Calls may specify, if experts on the ARoE answer to the call by\n         confirming their intention to remain as experts on the ARoE.6 Experts may be added\n         through an additional call before the next call in the event that the appropriate expertise is\n         not available. The selection process shall be open to both external experts and secretariat\n         staff.\n21.      The selection of experts on the ARoE shall be made by the AEP. The size and composition\n         of the ARoE shall be sufficient to cover the relevant needs. Selection shall be made taking\n         into account regional balance and gender balance, as appropriate. Once experts have\n         been selected, the secretariat shall maintain a database in the form of a roster of experts\n         containing personal and contact details and records on educational and professional\n         qualifications.\n22.      The AEP shall appoint two evaluators from among its own members. The evaluators shall\n         evaluate applicants for the ARoE and prepare a recommendation for the AEP, with support\n         from the secretariat.\n23.      The secretariat shall analyse the information provided in the application documents\n         submitted by an applicant for the ARoE. If the secretariat considers that a candidate\n         possibly fulfils the initial qualification requirements, the secretariat shall request the\n         applicant to submit supporting evidence. The secretariat shall analyse it and submit a\n         summary to the evaluators, with a recommendation to include the applicant on the ARoE\n         or reject the application.\n24.      The two appointed evaluators shall concurrently and independently review the summary\n         of the information and inform the secretariat on their conclusion on acceptance or rejection\n\n\n6\n    The term of experts on the rosters shall be for a minimum period of two years, which can be renewed.\n    Experts on the ARoE shall be kept on the roster until experts are selected in the next call.\n\n\n\n                                                 7 of 16\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-005\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation\nroster of experts\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n       of the proposal from the secretariat. If the two evaluators submit different conclusions, the\n       secretariat will notify them of the different conclusions. In this case, the evaluators shall\n       discuss the recommendation further between themselves in an effort to reach an\n       unanimous conclusion. The evaluators may request the secretariat to send any evidence\n       received or to seek further information to demonstrate that the candidate meets the\n       qualification requirements.\n25.    The AEP, at its next meeting, shall consider the final conclusion of the evaluators and\n       decide whether to include the applicant on the ARoE or reject the application.\n26.    Experts on the ARoE shall provide to the secretariat evidence related to any updates to\n       their educational development, training activities undertaken and work experience relevant\n       to the specific roles qualified and be subject to regular performance monitoring on their\n       competence and qualification through evaluation process as specified in section 5.4.1\n       below.\n\n5.4.1. Performance monitoring\n27.    The AEP provides oversight to the process of monitoring the performance of all experts\n       on the ARoE and makes the final decision on the outcomes of the performance monitoring.\n28.    The monitoring of performance shall be undertaken as follows:\n       (a)     Members of an assessment team will be monitored by the team lead;\n       (b)     The team lead will be monitored by either a senior representative of the secretariat\n               or another expert to be selected by the secretariat. In the latter case, the selected\n               expert shall be qualified as a lead A6.4 assessor and shall have at least two years\n               of lead assessor experience.\n29.    The following schedule of performance monitoring is established:\n       (a)     Upon the completion of the expert’s first participation as a team member;\n       (b)     For a trainee A6.4 assessor: before being approved as an A 6.4 assessor;\n       (c)     For an A6.4 assessor or technical expert: one on-site observation every two years;\n       (d)     For a trainee lead A6.4 assessor: before being approved as a lead A6.4 assessor;\n       (e)     For a lead A6.4 assessor: one on-site observation every three years or at the\n               request of the AEP.\n30.    The secretariat shall share the findings from the performance monitoring report with the\n       expert.\n31.    Where a performance evaluation identifies a need for improvement, the evaluated expert\n       shall submit a proposal on how she/he intends to address all identified issues. The expert\n       shall endeavor to implement the proposed measures and, upon completion of the\n       measures, submit to the secretariat relevant evidence. The same evaluator who prepared\n       the performance report shall re-evaluate the expert based on the evidence provided or\n       through additional monitoring, depending on the type and significance of the issue(s)\n       identified, as decided by the secretariat.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8 of 16\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-005\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation\nroster of experts\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n32.      Where a performance evaluation identifies an unsatisfactory level of performance, the\n         secretariat shall seek a second opinion, if possible, in the same assessment process or in\n         another assessment process to confirm the evaluation. If the negative evaluation is\n         confirmed, the secretariat shall inform the evaluated expert. The expert shall have seven\n         days or be within the duration requested by the AEP, to respond in writing describing\n         her/his views on the evaluation, including root cause analysis and proposed corrective\n         actions. The expert shall have 30 days or be within the duration requested by the AEP, to\n         submit the evidence on the implementation of the proposed corrective actions.\n33.      The AEP shall consider the results of the monitoring process, relevant evidence and\n         responses, as applicable, and decide on one of the following options:\n         (a)    Maintain the expert on the same roles qualified on ARoE;\n         (b)    Withdraw the expert from the ARoE;\n         (c)    Take any other appropriate actions.7\n34.      If an expert was not assigned to any accreditation assessment for more than 30 months\n         or had been previously removed from the ARoE, the expert shall be subject to the\n         performance monitoring on his/her first assignment.\n35.      Information obtained during the performance evaluation and its results shall be treated as\n         confidential.\n\n5.4.2. Suspension of membership\n36.      An expert may be suspended from a roster for the following reasons:\n         (a)    She/he has failed to deliver work of the required level of quality and within the\n                expected time frames; or\n         (b)    She/he has been found to be in breach of the applicable provisions of the code of\n                conduct as per section 5.2 above, including, the applicable provisions relating to\n                conflict of interest; or\n         (c)    She/he has been found to be in breach of the confidentiality requirements.\n37.      If an expert on the ARoE is appointed as a member of the Supervisory Body or the AEP,\n         the secretariat shall place his/her membership on the ARoE “on hold” for the duration of\n         his/her term of service on that body. On completion of that membership term the\n         secretariat shall reinstate him/her on the ARoE after the corresponding evaluation by the\n         AEP evaluators.\n38.      The secretariat shall undertake measures to safeguard the impartiality of the member\n         during these transitions.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    The appropriate actions may include the following, but are not limited to: reconduct the root cause\n    analysis; repropose corrective actions; reimplement the proposed corrective actions; or downgrade\n    his/her ARoE roles.\n\n\n\n                                                9 of 16\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-005\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation\nroster of experts\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n6.     Modalities of work\n39.    The secretariat shall establish an AT for an assessment, selecting its members from the\n       ARoE in accordance with the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation procedure.\n40.    When establishing an AT, the secretariat shall take into account the following principles:\n       (a)     Competence of the team: members of the AT shall collectively possess the\n               necessary competence based on the characteristics of the AE/DOE, the sectoral\n               scopes for which the AE/DOE is applying or is accredited, and the project activity\n               or PoA associated with the assessment;\n       (b)     Regional balance: to the extent possible, the AT should include experts from\n               different regions in order to maintain regional balance and allow capacity-building\n               in all regions;\n       (c)     Use of resources: to the extent possible, all experts on the ARoE should be utilized\n               in assessments, according to their expertise, while ensuring that a balance\n               between external resources and secretariat staff is maintained;\n       (d)     Language: to the extent possible, the AT should include an expert who has\n               knowledge of the local language relating to the accreditation assessment.\n41.    The secretariat may attach an observer or a trainee A6.4 assessor to the AT. The cost of\n       his/her participation as an observer in the accreditation assessment shall be borne by the\n       secretariat. The rules pertaining to conflict of interest, impartiality and confidentiality for\n       A6.4 assessors contained in this procedure, shall apply to observers and trainee A6.4\n       assessors.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10 of 16\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-005\nProcedure: Selection and performance evaluation of experts on the Article 6.4 mechanism accreditation\nroster of experts\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1.

Upon receipt of the appeal fee, if applicable, the secretariat, within 7 days, shall undertake\n       the completeness check to determine whether the submitted appeal form contains all\n       required information referred to in paragraph 11 above. If the secretariat finds the\n\n                                               7 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       information contained in the appeal form is incomplete, it shall request the appellant, by\n       providing the reason for incompleteness, to submit a revised form to fill the gap within 21\n       days. The appellant can request a one-time extension of the deadline for revising the form\n       no longer than 14 days. In this case, if the appellant does not submit a revised form within\n       this timeframe, or the submitted revised form is still found to be incomplete, the appeal\n       shall be deemed withdrawn and the secretariat shall notify the appellant accordingly,\n       reimbursing the appeal fee after deducting USD 500 if the appeal fee has been paid in\n       accordance with paragraph 13 above.\n16.    Upon successful conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall establish an\n       appeal panel to review this specific appeal by appointing three experts from the roster\n       established for the appeal and grievance processes under this procedure, taking into\n       account the specificity of the case and the expertise of each expert, and designating one\n       of them as the chair of the panel. The secretariat shall forward the appeal form and any\n       supporting documentation submitted by the appellant to the members of the appeal panel.\n17.    The appeal panel shall determine, within seven days of receipt of the appeal from the\n       secretariat, whether the appellant is eligible for filing the appeal in question in accordance\n       with paragraph 7 above, the appeal is against appealable decisions referred to in\n       paragraph 9 above, and the grounds for the appeal as claimed by the appellant are one\n       or more of those referred to in paragraph 10 above. If the appeal panel determines that\n       the appellant or the appeal does not satisfy any of these eligibility requirements for\n       appeals, it shall reject the appeal. In this case, the secretariat shall promptly inform the\n       appellant accordingly and reimburse the appeal fee after deducting USD 1,000 if the\n       appeal fee has been paid in accordance with paragraph 13 above. In order to determine\n       the eligibility, the chair of the appeal panel may, through the secretariat, request the\n       appellant and/or any other individual or organization it deems necessary for that purpose\n       to provide additional information.\n18.    Once the appeal panel has confirmed that the appellant and the appeal satisfy all of the\n       eligibility requirements for appeals, the secretariat shall publish the appeal on the\n       UNFCCC website and immediately notify the Supervisory Body of the publication of the\n       appeal. The personal identification and data indicated by appellant as confidential as per\n       paragraphs 11(a) and 11(c) above shall not be published.\n19.    Over the entire course of the processing of the appeal, the appellant’s personal details\n       (name and contact information) shall be made available only to limited members of the\n       secretariat as necessary, unless otherwise expressly agreed by the appellant.\n\n4.4.4. Initial response by the Supervisory Body\n20.    The Chair of the Supervisory Body, in consultation with its Vice-Chair, may provide the\n       background and/or reasoning of the Supervisory Body decision in question to the appeal\n       panel within 14 days of the publication of the appeal on the UNFCCC website.\n\n4.4.5. Review and ruling\n21.    The appeal panel shall review the appeal to consider the merits of the matter and prepare\n       a ruling within 14 days after the publication of the appeal on the UNFCCC website. In\n       doing so, the appeal panel may, through the secretariat, request the designated\n       operational entity (DOE) that validated or verified the request, or the Methodological\n       Expert Panel that recommended methodological products that contain Party-specific\n       elements applicable to the host Party regarding which the Supervisory Body has made the\n       decision in question, or any other relevant individual or organization that is independent\n\n\n                                              8 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       from the appellant, to clarify any of the information contained in the appeal form. If the\n       appeal panel has made such request for clarification, the deadline shall be extended\n       accordingly.\n22.    The appeal panel shall take into account only:\n       (a)     The information in the appeal form provided by the appellant and published in\n               accordance with paragraph 18 above, including the references to supporting\n               documents and other sources of information;\n       (b)     Clarification provided by the DOE, Methodological Expert Panel or any other\n               individual or organization, of the information contained in the appeal form in\n               accordance with paragraph 21 above, as applicable;\n       (c)     The Supervisory Body’s decision under appeal and any previous decisions of the\n               Supervisory Body within the activity cycle;\n       (d)     The RMPs, other relevant CMA decisions, and standards and procedures adopted\n               by the Supervisory Body;\n       (e)     Any appeal or response that was previously filed by the same appellant as part of\n               a previous appeal in relation to the activity, or methodological products in question\n               and the previous appeal is deemed materially relevant;\n       (f)     The background and/or reasoning for the Supervisory Body decision provided as\n               an initial response by the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 20\n               above;\n       (g)     Any factual information from a source, the accuracy of which cannot be questioned\n               (e.g. the day of the week on a certain date).\n23.    In reviewing the appeal and preparing a ruling, the appeal panel shall also:\n       (a)     Defer to the Supervisory Body’s finding of facts, unless they are claimed by the\n               appellant to be erroneous in accordance with paragraph 10(c) or 10(d) above;\n       (b)     Defer to the Supervisory Body’s application of standards and procedures adopted\n               by the Supervisory Body, unless such application is claimed by the appellant to be\n               either incorrect or unreasonable in accordance with paragraph 10(b) above.\n24.    The ruling of the appeal panel shall conclude in one of the following ways and provide the\n       rationale for its conclusion:\n       (a)     Affirming the decision of the Supervisory Body;\n       (b)     Remanding the matter to the Supervisory Body for reconsideration (hereinafter\n               referred to as remand ruling).\n25.    The ruling shall detail the grounds for its conclusion and supporting argumentation and\n       findings.\n26.    The appeal panel, through the secretariat, shall notify the Supervisory Body and the\n       appellant of its ruling. The secretariat shall promptly publish the ruling on the UNFCCC\n       website.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n4.4.6. Reconsideration by the Supervisory Body upon remand\n27.    If the ruling by the appeal panel is a remand ruling referred to in paragraph 24(b) above,\n       the Supervisory Body shall reconsider its decision under the appeal and conclude its\n       reconsideration within 30 days of the notification of the remand ruling to the Supervisory\n       Body.\n28.    In concluding its reconsideration, the Supervisory Body shall issue a new decision.\n29.    The Supervisory Body shall provide the rationale for the new decision referred to in\n       paragraph 28 above, including:\n       (a)     How the new decision addresses the conclusions of the remand ruling;\n       (b)     The RMPs, other relevant CMA decisions, or relevant standards and procedures\n               adopted by the Supervisory Body applied to the facts and their interpretation;\n       (c)     The interpretation of the RMPs, other relevant CMA decisions, or relevant\n               standards and procedures adopted by the Supervisory Body as applied to the\n               facts;\n       (d)     The facts and any interpretation of the facts that formed the basis of the new\n               decision.\n30.    The secretariat shall promptly resume the suspended process and publish the\n       reconsideration decision together with the provided rationale on the UNFCCC website,\n       and notify the appellant and, if applicable, the activity participants, the DOE and the\n       participating Parties, through their DNAs, of the publication of the new decision.\n31.    If the Supervisory Body issued a new decision, the processing of the case in question shall\n       be treated as if the new decision were the original decision in terms of the effectiveness\n       of the decision.\n32.    If the ruling of the appeal panel is a remand ruling referred to in paragraph 24(b) above,\n       the secretariat shall reimburse the appeal fee in full to the appellant if a fee is paid in\n       accordance with paragraph 13 above.\n33.    The appeal panel shall not have the authority to award any monetary compensation for\n       damages to the appellant or any other individual or organization other than the\n       reimbursement of the appeal fee as referred to in paragraphs 32 above.\n34.    The conclusions by the appeal panel, including ruling on, or rejection of, the appeal shall\n       be final and shall not be further considered or subject to a new appeal.\n\n5.     Grievance process\n5.1.   Standing\n35.    A grievance may be submitted by individuals, communities and organizations (hereinafter\n       referred to as grievants) that meet all the following eligibility requirements:\n       (a)     They are connected to the jurisdiction, by means of residency or domicile, where\n               the activity in question is implemented. In the absence of documentary evidence,\n               the residency or domicile can be proven by any other means that demonstrate the\n               grievant’s connection to the jurisdiction;\n\n\n\n                                             10 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (b)     They have substantial presence in the geographic area, by means of their business\n               activity or community-related activity, which is or may be directly affected by the\n               activity in question;\n       (c)     They suffer or may suffer direct adverse effects from the implementation or\n               treatment of the activity in question within the activity cycle under the Article 6.4\n               mechanism by way of concrete, tangible and particularized claim of harm to the\n               health, property, local environment or other interest.\n\n5.2.   Scope\n36.    A grievance may be submitted only in respect of adverse effects of a social, economic or\n       environmental nature that are suffered or may be suffered by local individuals,\n       communities or businesses as a direct consequence of the implementation or treatment\n       of a registered A6.4 activity within the activity cycle under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n37.    A complaint on the design and operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism, including in relation\n       to the governance, the activity cycle, the methodology and standardized baseline\n       development process and the accreditation process, shall not be submitted as a grievance\n       under this procedure, but may be submitted under the “Procedure: Consideration of\n       unsolicited letters to the Supervisory Body”.\n\n5.3.   Procedure\n\n5.3.1. Submitting a grievance\n38.    A grievant or its authorized representative (hereinafter collectively referred to as a\n       grievant) may submit a grievance, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website\n       by completing a “Grievance form” covering the following information within the valid\n       crediting period of the Article 6.4 activity in question:\n       (a)     The name and category (e.g. individual, community, organization) of the grievant.\n               The grievant may indicate if the personal identification and data shall be treated as\n               confidential;\n       (b)     The relationship of each individual, community and organization listed as the\n               grievant to the activity in question to demonstrate its eligibility as grievant as per\n               the requirements of paragraph 35 above;\n       (c)     The name and contact information (email address, phone number, physical\n               address) of the focal point of the grievant. If an authorized representative of the\n               (original) grievant submits the grievance, the evidence of such authorization shall\n               be submitted (including signature of the grievant). The grievant may indicate if the\n               personal identification and data shall be treated as confidential;\n       (d)     The title and UNFCCC reference number of the A6.4 activity in question;\n       (e)     Description of the direct adverse effect complained by the grievant and how it is\n               related to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity in question and a declaration\n               in the form of an sworn statement on the actual direct adverse effect and its relation\n               to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity;\n       (f)     Description of a suggested remedy;\n\n\n\n\n                                              11 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (g)     References to supporting documents, which may be attached, and other sources\n               of information, with an explanation as to how the supporting documents and other\n               information support the arguments made in the grievance;\n       (h)     Reference to, or evidence of, any previous or ongoing attempt to resolve the issue\n               including through conciliation directly with any other individual or organization.\n\n5.3.2. Completeness and eligibility checks\n39.    The secretariat shall undertake the completeness check within 7 days to determine\n       whether the submitted grievance form contains all required information referred to in\n       paragraph 38 above. If the secretariat finds that the information contained in the grievance\n       form is incomplete, it shall request the grievant, by providing the reason for\n       incompleteness, to submit a revised form to fill the gap within 21 days. The grievant can\n       request a one-time extension of the deadline for revising the form of no longer than 14\n       days. In this case, if the grievant does not submit a revised form within this timeframe, or\n       the submitted revised form is still found to be incomplete, the grievance shall be deemed\n       withdrawn and the secretariat shall notify the grievant accordingly.\n40.    Upon successful conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall establish a\n       grievance panel to review this specific grievance by appointing three experts on the roster\n       referred to in paragraph 16 above, taking into account the specificity of the case and the\n       expertise of each expert, and designating one of them as the chair of the panel. The\n       secretariat shall forward the grievance form and any supporting documentation submitted\n       by the grievant to the members of the grievance panel.\n41.    The grievance panel shall determine within seven days of receipt of the grievance from\n       the secretariat whether the grievant is eligible to submit the grievance in accordance with\n       paragraph 35 above and the grievance is within the scope referred to in paragraph 36\n       above. If the grievance panel determines that the grievant or the grievance does not satisfy\n       any of these eligibility requirements for grievances, it shall reject the grievance. In this\n       case, the secretariat shall promptly inform the grievant of the rejection accordingly. In order\n       to determine the eligibility, the chair of the grievance panel may, through the secretariat,\n       request the grievant and/or any other individual or organization it deems necessary for\n       that purpose to provide additional information.\n42.    Once the grievance panel has confirmed that the grievant and the grievance satisfy all of\n       the eligibility requirements for grievances, the secretariat shall publish the grievance on\n       the UNFCCC website and immediately notify the Supervisory Body of the publication of\n       the grievance. The personal identification and data indicated by the appellant as\n       confidential as per paragraphs 38(a) and 38(c) above shall not be published.\n43.    If the grievance contains accusations against specific individuals or organizations that may\n       trigger legal actions under the relevant domestic laws, the grievance panel shall decide\n       whether to make publicly available the grievance or any specific information therein, and\n       request the secretariat not to publish the grievance or to publish a partially redacted\n       version.\n44.    Over the entire course of the processing of a grievance, the grievant’s personal details\n       (name and contact information) shall be made available only to limited members of the\n       secretariat as necessary, unless otherwise expressly agreed by the grievant.\n\n\n\n\n                                              12 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n5.3.3. Consideration and recommendations\n45.    The grievance panel shall consider the grievance and prepare recommendations or reject\n       the grievance within 14 days after the publication of the grievance on the UNFCCC\n       website. In doing so, the grievance panel may, through the secretariat, request the\n       grievant or other relevant individual or organization to provide additional information,\n       specifying the deadline that the grievance panel deems reasonable for the grievant or\n       other individual or organization to prepare such additional information. The additional\n       information shall be submitted in 21 days unless the grievant requests for one-time\n       extension of no longer than 14 days.\n46.    The grievance panel shall reject the grievance if:\n       (a)     Insufficient information is provided to prepare a recommendation (e.g. the\n               information is too general, unspecified and, therefore, non-actionable);\n       (b)     Additional information requested in accordance with paragraph 45 above is not\n               provided by the specified deadline in accordance with paragraph 45 above from\n               the grievant;\n       (c)     The grievant organization’s legitimacy to represent (potentially) affected\n               individuals, entities or communities is not explicit and proven, as applicable.\n47.    If the grievance panel does not reject the grievance, it shall outline its findings,\n       considerations and recommendations as appropriate. The findings or recommendations\n       may include:\n       (a)     Recommendations to the activity participants on corrective actions which may\n               address the grievance;\n       (b)     Recommendations to the national authority of the host Party, through its DNA, of\n               the activity in question on corrective actions which may address the grievance;\n       (c)     Recommendations to the Supervisory Body on consideration of decisions on the\n               activity in question within the activity cycle under the Article 6.4 mechanism, such\n               as temporary suspension of issuance or renewal until the host Party or the activity\n               participants demonstrate that they have addressed the issue raised in the\n               grievance;\n       (d)     General recommendations to the Supervisory Body on revisions of Article 6.4\n               mechanism rules and regulations, including on the activity cycle, methodologies\n               and accreditation;\n       (e)     The grievance was found not substantiated on its merits.\n48.    The secretariat shall promptly publish the outcome of the consideration of the grievance\n       panel ‒ that is, either to issue recommendations or reject the grievance ‒ on the UNFCCC\n       website, and communicate the outcome to the grievant, and if there are recommendations,\n       also to the relevant individual(s) and/or organization(s).\n49.    Within 14 days upon receipt of the communication on the outcome of the consideration of\n       the grievance, the grievant may request, by email through a dedicated email address to\n       the secretariat, that the secretariat, along with the members of the grievance panel, make\n       a call to the grievant to provide clarifications on the outcome, limited to the relevant\n       procedural provisions. Only one such request, regardless of the requesting grievant, shall\n       be allowed per submission of grievance. In this case, the grievant shall provide the contact\n\n\n                                             13 of 18\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-006\nProcedure: Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       details of the person to be called and the preferred time slots. The secretariat shall ensure\n       that, if requested by the grievant, the identity of the identified person shall be kept\n       confidential. The secretariat shall fix an appointment for the call within three days of receipt\n       of the request. The secretariat shall record the call and, if needed, classify it as\n       confidential.\n50.    The grievance panel shall not have the authority to recommend awarding any monetary\n       compensation for damages to the grievant or any other individual or organization.\n51.    The conclusion by the grievance panel, including recommendations on, or rejection of, the\n       grievance shall be final and unappealable, and shall not be further considered or subject\n       to a new grievance.\n\n5.3.4. Monitoring of outcome of recommendations\n52.    If the grievance panel issued recommendations referred to in paragraph 47(b) above, the\n       secretariat shall, three months after the issuance of such recommendations, contact the\n       DNA of the host Party to inquire about actions taken by the national authority based on\n       the recommendations, report its findings to the Supervisory Body, and publish the outcome\n       of the inquiry on the UNFCCC website.\n53.    If the grievance panel issued recommendations referred to in paragraph 47(c) above, the\n       Supervisory Body shall either:\n       (a)     Take actions within the activity cycle as it deems appropriate; or\n       (b)     Decide not to take actions regarding the activity in question within the activity cycle.\n54.    If the Supervisory Body takes action within the activity cycle in accordance with paragraph\n       53(a) above, it shall provide a notification on the course of action to the DNA of the host\n       Party.\n\n6.     Roster of experts and appeal and grievance panels\n6.1.   Roster of experts\n55.    The roster of experts shall comprise 30 experts, serving for both the appeal and grievance\n       processes in accordance with this procedure.\n56.    The secretariat shall make a public call for experts to appoint them on the roster based on\n       the terms of reference contained in this section.\n57.    The secretariat shall appoint experts on the roster initially for a period of four years for 15\n       experts and for a period of two years for the remaining 15 experts to ensure continuity.\n       Thereafter, the secretariat shall appoint all experts for a period of four years.

This can\n       occur during the development, revision, clarification, and updating of methodologies\n       and/or standardized baselines, as well as during the accreditation cycle of DOEs in\n       accordance with the applicable procedures.\n\n6.1.1. Calls for input and targeted workshops or webinars\n13.    When preparing a new regulatory document or a major revision of a regulatory document\n       that has a significant impact on stakeholders, the secretariat, at the request of the\n       Supervisory Body, may:\n       (a)     Launch a call for public input to gather stakeholder views on the areas to be\n               covered or revised in the document and the concerns that the Supervisory Body\n               should address;\n       (b)     Organize a workshop or webinar, including practitioner focused events, to facilitate\n               stakeholder input;\n       (c)     Undertake any other form of targeted engagement as instructed by the Supervisory\n               Body.\n14.    Should the Supervisory Body decide to launch a call for input and/or a workshop, it shall\n       specify the stage at which stakeholder views are sought (e.g., concept stage, or specific\n       to a draft document).\n15.    The duration of a call for input shall be decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on\n       the complexity and urgency of the issue for which input is being sought, allowing\n       reasonable time for comments to be submitted.\n\n\n\n                                               5 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-007\nProcedure: Direct communication with stakeholders\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n16.       Calls for input shall be publicly announced through notifications on the dedicated Article\n          6.4 webpages and social media pages, the A6.4 mechanism newsletter, and notifications\n          to relevant established mailing lists, as appropriate.\n17.       In relation to a call for input, the Supervisory Body may request the secretariat to undertake\n          additional outreach to DNA’s, including through the DNA forum, host Parties, and/or the\n          UNFCCC National Focal Points, DOEs or any other relevant stakeholders to solicit input\n          on specific matters.\n18.       The secretariat may invite selected stakeholders to workshops to gain further or\n          elaborated views on regulatory documents or other relevant issues. In selecting invitees,\n          the secretariat shall balance the interests of the stakeholders with the composition of\n          participants and strive for appropriate gender and regional balance to ensure an effective\n          outcome of the workshop.\n19.       Upon receiving stakeholder input, through call for inputs or workshops, the secretariat\n          shall:\n          (a)     Consider the inputs with a focus on matters related to the topic under consultation\n                  and, in line with its agreed workplan, prepare a summary of the inputs received for\n                  the Supervisory Body. This summary should provide the rationale for accepting\n                  inputs in the documents under development or revision and justify why any inputs\n                  were not incorporated;\n          (b)     Revise the documents under development or revision and submit them for the\n                  consideration of the Supervisory Body.\n\n6.2.      Communication initiated by stakeholders\n20.       Stakeholders may initiate communication with the Supervisory Body, the secretariat, the\n          MEP and the AEP in accordance with provisions included in the applicable procedures.13\n21.

At each of its meetings, the Supervisory Body shall allocate a time slot for interactions with\n          registered observers, subject to time constraints. The Supervisory Body may limit the\n          number of observers permitted to speak or their speaking time, based on time constraints.\n23.       Public comments on meeting documentation shall be received by the Supervisory Body\n          until one week prior to the meeting, unless otherwise decided by the Chair.\n24.       Any stakeholder may submit written input related to a Supervisory Body meeting. All\n          written inputs received at least one week prior to the first day of the meeting shall be made\n          available for the Supervisory Body’s consideration.\n25.       The secretariat shall compile the comments received up until one week prior to the\n          meeting, as per paragraph 52 of the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Body and bring\n\n\n13   For example, paragraph 64 of the activity cycle procedure specifies that the DOE or the activity\n     participants may request a call with the secretariat to provide clarifications on the issues identified when\n     a request for review is raised for a request for registration.\n14   Annex II of Decision 7/CMA.4. Available at\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_10a02E.pdf#page_46.\n\n\n                                                     6 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-007\nProcedure: Direct communication with stakeholders\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n       the compilation to the attention of the Supervisory Body for its consideration at the start of\n       the meeting.

Written inputs received after the one-week deadline, as specified in paragraph 25 above,\n       will not be considered by the Supervisory Body. These inputs shall be made available for\n       consideration by the Supervisory Body at a future meeting, as appropriate.\n27.    The Supervisory Body shall consider input from the observers, whether received during\n       interactions or through written submissions, either at the same meeting or at a future\n       meeting, as appropriate.\n\n7.     Non-process-based communication\n7.1.   Interaction with designated national authorities\n28.    The secretariat shall, on behalf of the Supervisory Body, organize forum meetings for\n       DNAs (DNA forum), as per the terms of reference of DNA forum to facilitate\n       communication between the Supervisory Body and DNAs, and among DNAs themselves.\n29.    The Supervisory Body shall allocate time during its meetings for interaction with the DNA\n       forum (through its co-chairs) at least twice a year. The Supervisory Body shall specify the\n       dates of the meetings designated for interaction at its first meeting of each year.\n30.    The Supervisory Body may invite the co-chairs of the DNA forum to any of its meetings in\n       addition to the two referred to in paragraph 29 above, as necessary, or if requested by the\n       co-chairs of the DNA forum.\n\n7.2.   Interaction with designated operational authorities (DOEs) and applicant\n       entities (AEs)\n\n7.2.1. Supervisory Body interaction with DOEs and AEs\n31.    The Supervisory Body shall allocate time for interaction with the forum of DOEs and AEs\n       coordination (DOE/AE coordination forum) at each of its meetings through its chair on\n       issues of interest to DOEs/AEs.\n32.    The chair of the DOE/AE coordination forum should submit a presentation to the\n       secretariat to be used during the interaction with the Supervisory Body at its meeting, four\n       days prior to the meeting. The presentation shall include the views of the DOE/AE\n       coordination forum on issues included in the annotated agenda of the Supervisory Body\n       meeting and any other matters of interest to be raised by the DOEs/AEs.\n33.    The Supervisory Body shall take note of the input received from the DOE/AE coordination\n       forum during the interaction referred to in paragraph 32 above and shall consider the input\n       at the same meeting or at a future meeting, as appropriate.\n34.    The Supervisory Body may communicate with the DOE/AE coordination forum through\n       the secretariat, to obtain the DOEs/AEs’ views on topics that impact them. In this case,\n       the secretariat shall communicate with the DOE/AE coordination forum at a timing that\n       allows sufficient time for DOEs/AEs to prepare their views. The DOE/AE coordination\n       forum shall coordinate with its members to prepare consolidated views on the topics for\n       consideration by the Supervisory Body. The chair of the DOE/AE coordination forum shall\n       include these consolidated views in the presentation referred to in paragraph 32 above.\n\n\n                                               7 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-007\nProcedure: Direct communication with stakeholders\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n7.2.2. Secretariat interaction with DOEs/AEs\n35.    The secretariat shall, as required, provide opportunities for it to liaise with members of the\n       DOE/AE coordination forum to ensure they are informed of Supervisory Body decisions\n       and have opportunities to seek clarifications on relevant regulations. Such opportunities\n       may include conference calls with members of the DOE/AE coordination forum who wish\n       to participate for this purpose. The dates for such conference calls may be determined at\n       the beginning of each year based on the Supervisory Body’s workplan and may be revised\n       as necessary based on the outcomes of Supervisory Body meetings. The secretariat shall\n       circulate minutes of each call to the DOE/AE coordination forum within a week of any such\n       call, and share the minutes or other summarized information, as appropriate, with the\n       Supervisory Body.\n36.    The secretariat may also organize, periodically and subject to the availability of resources,\n       annual and regional calibration workshops for DOEs/AEs to discuss decisions of the\n       Supervisory Body, share good practices among DOEs/AEs, and ensure a common\n       understanding of the Article 6.4 rules and regulations.\n37.    The secretariat, as deemed appropriate, shall support the forum by establishing necessary\n       communication channels to facilitate interaction among its members.\n\n7.2.3. Accreditation Expert Panel interaction with DOEs/AE coordination forum\n38.    The AEP may allocate time during its meetings for interaction with the DOE/AE\n       coordination forum through its chair and, if the forum wishes, with a limited number of\n       DOEs/AEs. This interaction shall be limited to policy issues relevant to the accreditation\n       standards and procedures and shall not include case-specific issues.\n39.

The secretariat may periodically organize general consultation workshops for\n       stakeholders, such as roundtables, subject to the resources available in the Resource\n       Allocation Plan of the Supervisory Body.\n51.    These general consultation workshops should provide opportunities for sharing good\n       practices, enhancing understanding of the Article 6.4 mechanism rules, exchanging ideas,\n       and facilitating free discussion between Supervisory Body members, the secretariat and\n       stakeholders on general policy issues, as well as exchanging experiences on the\n       implementation of various Article 6.4 mechanism rules.\n52.    The secretariat shall prepare agendas for such events in consultation with stakeholders to\n       ensure that issues of stakeholders’ interest are discussed when appropriate.\n53.    When selecting invitees to such events, the secretariat shall consider representation of all\n       interested parties, space limitations and agenda. In doing so, the secretariat shall pay\n       particular attention to ensuring regional balance among invitees and providing a virtual\n       participation option.\n54.    At the beginning of each year, the secretariat shall provide the Supervisory Body with the\n       recommended number of general consultation workshops, if any, for the coming year,\n       based on the Supervisory Body workplan and the forecasted need for consultation with\n       stakeholders. The Supervisory Body shall consider the secretariat’s recommendation\n       when deciding whether to request the organization of such workshops.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-007\nProcedure: Direct communication with stakeholders\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n55.      The secretariat shall ensure that the outcomes of these consultations with stakeholders\n         are formally documented, published on the UNFCCC website, and brought to the attention\n         of the Supervisory Body for its consideration alongside the relevant regulatory document\n         or concept note under consideration.\n\n7.4.2. Interaction initiated by stakeholders\n56.      A channel of communication shall be available to stakeholders to facilitate understanding,\n         application, and development of the Article 6.4 mechanism rules, as well as the\n         implementation of project activities and programmes of activities.\n57.      Stakeholders may initiate communications on matters that do not fall within the scope of\n         a dedicated process procedure (e.g., technical or operational explanation or\n         suggestions/proposals for new regulations) using the “Stakeholder communication\n         form”.15\n58.      Stakeholders may choose to submit:\n         (a)      Communication to the secretariat for a fast-track response, as outlined in section\n                  7.4.2.1 below; or\n         (b)      Communication to the Supervisory Body for a formal response, as outlined in\n                  section 7.4.2.2 below.\n\n7.4.2.1.          Interaction initiated by stakeholders to the secretariat\n59.      Stakeholders may communicate with the secretariat via a dedicated interface on the\n         UNFCCC website.\n60.      The secretariat shall respond to a communication addressed to it as soon as possible and\n         within 15 working days of receipt. Neither the communication nor the response will be\n         published on the UNFCCC website.\n61.      All responses provided by the secretariat through this process shall include a disclaimer\n         stating that the responses are not endorsed by the Supervisory Body, and do not\n         supersede or pre-empt decisions and regulations of the Supervisory Body, or the\n         validation/verification opinions of DOEs on specific project activities or programmes of\n         activities.\n62.      If the secretariat finds that it requires the attention of or further guidance from the\n         Supervisory Body, it may redirect the communication to the Supervisory Body track\n         referred to in section 7.4.2.2 below. In such cases, the secretariat shall inform the\n         submitter and provide a justification for redirecting the communication to the Supervisory\n         Body.\n\n7.4.2.2.          Interaction initiated by stakeholders to the Supervisory Body\n63.      Stakeholders may communicate directly with the Supervisory Body via a dedicated\n         interface on the UNFCCC website. The secretariat shall make all communications to the\n         Supervisory Body available to it. Unless the submitter explicitly requests the secretariat\n         for confidentiality, stakeholder communications with the Supervisory Body shall be publicly\n         available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n15   The secretariat may develop an electronic interface for the form.\n\n\n                                                   10 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-007\nProcedure: Direct communication with stakeholders\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n64.    The secretariat shall prepare a draft response, providing the Chair and the Vice-Chair of\n       the Supervisory Body with relevant information and an analysis of the content of the\n       communication. Based on this information and analysis, the Chair and Vice-Chair shall\n       jointly decide on one of the following courses of action for each communication:\n       (a)     The Chair and Vice-Chair respond to the submitter on behalf of the Supervisory\n               Body;\n       (b)     The Chair and Vice-Chair forward the communication for consideration by the\n               Supervisory Body;\n       (c)     The secretariat responds to the submitter on behalf of the Supervisory Body in\n               accordance with a draft response approved by the Chair and Vice-Chair of the\n               Supervisory Body.\n65.    If the Chair and the Vice-Chair choose the course of action outlined in paragraph 64(b),\n       the communication shall be considered by the Supervisory Body either through electronic\n       means or at a meeting, depending on the timing of the next meeting. If a communication\n       is received more than 28 days before the next meeting, it shall be placed on the agenda\n       of that meeting. Otherwise, it shall be placed on the agenda of the subsequent meeting\n       unless the Chair of the Supervisory Body decides otherwise. If a communication is placed\n       on the agenda of a meeting, the Supervisory Body should aim to finalize its consideration\n       during that meeting\n66.    The secretariat, in consultation with the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Body may\n       also refer communications directly to an expert panel for consideration at its next meeting.\n67.    The secretariat should respond to a communication addressed to the Supervisory Body\n       as soon as possible, and within 35 days of receipt, by:\n       (a)     Providing a response to the request or feedback in accordance with paragraph\n               64(c) above; or\n       (b)     Informing the submitter that the request or feedback will be referred to the\n               Supervisory Body or a panel for its consideration in accordance with paragraph\n               64(a) and (b) above; and/or\n       (c)     Informing the submitter that the request or feedback will be forwarded to another\n               relevant institution or body (e.g., DNA), if deemed appropriate by the Chair or Vice-\n               Chair of the Supervisory Body. However, such forwarding shall not constitute an\n               endorsement by the Supervisory Body of the communication’s content.\n68.    The secretariat shall make the response to the submitter publicly available, subject to the\n       confidentiality provisions in paragraphs 69 and 70 below.\n69.    Stakeholders may make a confidential communication and request a confidential\n       response from the Supervisory Body. The secretariat, on behalf of the Supervisory Body,\n       may decide to make its response publicly available if it is considered that it is in the\n       common interest of all stakeholders. In such cases, any confidential information shall be\n       removed from the response before publication.\n70.    If a stakeholder communication raises matters related to the personal identities of\n       Supervisory Body members, secretariat staff, panel members, or any stakeholders\n       relevant to an activity, or gives rise to potential legal implications; or if there is a similar\n       public interest in withholding the information from being made publicly available, the\n\n\n\n                                               11 of 13\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-007\nProcedure: Direct communication with stakeholders\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n         secretariat shall consult with the Supervisory Body Chair and Vice-Chair and may treat\n         the communication as confidential.\n71.      The secretariat shall not redirect communications addressed to the Supervisory Body to\n         the secretariat track referred to in paragraph 58 above.\n\n8.       Parties\n72.      DNAs shall serve as the primary contact point for communication between Parties and the\n         Supervisory Body and/or the secretariat.\n73.      A dedicated communication channel shall be available on the UNFCCC website for DNAs\n         to facilitate the understanding and application of the Article 6.4 mechanism rules and\n         regulations, as well as the implementation of activities and programmes of activities.\n74.      Parties may initiate communication with the Supervisory Body regarding any matters\n         within or outside the defined steps of a specific Article 6.4 process, as outlined in the\n         dedicated procedure for that specific case, in accordance with provisions stipulated under\n         section 7.4.2.2 above.16\n75.      Parties may participate in any meetings of the Supervisory Body and its expert Panels as\n         observers, in accordance with relevant provisions stipulated in this procedure. Parties may\n         also be invited to a meeting of the Supervisory Body to provide input on specific agenda\n         items and may be invited to present on matters under consideration by the Supervisory\n         Body at its meetings.\n76.      Parties, that wish to specify conditions to be applied for mechanism methodologies to\n         contribute to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between the participating Parties,\n         may communicate their approach by using the form “Host Party participation requirements\n         for Article 6.4 mechanism” 17 and/or develop, revise, clarify and update standardized\n         baseline aligned with the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of\n         standardized baselines”.\n77.      Parties may also initiate communication with the secretariat regarding any matters in\n         accordance with provisions stipulated under section 7.4.2.1.18\n78.

Introduction\n1.         The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n           Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body for the mechanism\n           established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to\n           ensure transparency of decision-making and make publicly available its decision-making\n           framework and decisions, including standards, procedures, and related documents.\n2.         The Supervisory Body plays a crucial role in developing and overseeing the regulatory\n           framework that guides the Article 6.4 mechanism’s implementation. In addition to being\n           transparent, the regulatory documents must be consistent and legally sound to support\n           the integrity of the carbon markets and emissions reductions under the Article 6.4\n           mechanism.\n3.         The CMA, at its sixth session, requested the Supervisory Body to engage, in consultation\n           with interested stakeholders, further independent scientific and technical expertise and\n           local communities, and include the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous\n           Peoples, as relevant, to support its work, including through its expert panels, to review\n           proposals as necessary and receive independent scientific and technical advice. It further\n           requested the Supervisory Body to consider relevant international environmental\n           agreements when carrying out its work, including when implementing the “Standard:\n           Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\n           assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”,1 the “Standard: Requirements for\n           activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism”2 and the “Article 6.4\n           sustainable development tool”. 3 It also requested the Supervisory Body, while ensuring\n           ongoing continuous improvements to reflect the best available science, to strive to ensure\n           regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to its adopted standards,\n           tools and procedures.\n4.         At its tenth meeting, the Supervisory Body requested the secretariat to undertake an initial\n           structured legal and editorial review of the regulations and procedures approved by the\n           Supervisory Body to ensure consistency among the regulations, including with regard to\n           its Rules of Procedure, and to undertake the first review in 2024 with a view to prepare\n           relevant proposals for consideration by the Supervisory Body in 2025. In addition, to\n           facilitate subsequent reviews of regulations, the Supervisory Body requested the\n           secretariat to establish a periodic structured legal and editorial review system of its\n           regulations to, among others, ensure transparency and consistency among the\n           regulations, as well as address any matters brought forward by the Supervisory Body for\n           consideration in this regard.\n\n2.         Scope, applicability, and entry into force\n2.1.       Scope\n5.         The purpose of this document is to establish the periodic structured legal and editorial\n           review system of the Supervisory Body’s regulatory documents governing the Article 6.4\n\n1    Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf.\n2    Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-002.pdf.\n3    Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-TOOL-AC-001.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                         3 of 10\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-008\nProcedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s\nregulatory documents\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n             mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the periodic review system) and set out its key\n             components and operational framework. This includes defining the focus of the review,\n             establishing the frequency and timelines for conducting the reviews, clarifying key roles\n             and responsibilities of involved actors, and outlining the related decision-making process.\n\n2.2.         Applicability\n6.           This document shall be applicable for the periodic review of all regulatory documents\n             approved by the Supervisory Body.\n\n2.3.         Entry into force\n7.           This document enters into force on 16 May 2025.\n\n3.           Definitions\n8.           The following definitions of terms are used in this document:\n             (a)    “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;\n             (b)    “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action\n                    is recommended as particularly suitable;\n             (c)    “May” is used to indicate what is permitted.\n\n4.           Normative references\n9.           This procedure should be read in conjunction with the “Decision and documentation\n             framework”.4 In line with that framework, the Supervisory Body is the regulatory body of\n             the Article 6.4 mechanism. Acting under the authority and guidance of the CMA, it is fully\n             accountable to the CMA. The Supervisory Body has authority over and provides guidance\n             to the activities and processes of the Article 6.4 mechanism. All decisions taken by the\n             Supervisory Body shall elaborate upon and be consistent with the CMA decisions.\n10.          Regulatory decisions of the Supervisory Body relate to the adoption of, or revision to the\n             Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements developed under its direction. These\n             decisions are reflected in the adoption of, or revision to, standards (including policy\n             standards, methodologies, and standardized baselines), procedures, tools (including\n             policy and methodological tools), guidelines and clarifications (including policy and\n             methodological clarifications), as recorded in and/or annexed to the meeting reports of the\n             Supervisory Body.5\n11.          Decisions of the Supervisory Body are recorded in the meeting reports of the Supervisory\n             Body and their accompanying annexes.

While\n     this framework includes provisions for document control and revision, it does not specifically establish a\n     formal legal and editorial review process.\n5    Ibid.\n\n\n\n                                                      4 of 10\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-008\nProcedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s\nregulatory documents\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n         regulatory decisions is published on the Article 6.4 mechanism Supervisory Body section\n         of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website.6\n\n5.       Periodic review system\n12.      Based on the initial review experience and lessons learned, a periodic review system is\n         hereby established, to ensure transparency and consistency among the regulations,\n         ensure continued compliance with CMA guidance, and address any matters brought\n         forward by the Supervisory Body for consideration in this regard.\n13.      To ensure transparency, the periodic review system shall envisage a formal process for\n         conducting the periodic reviews, based on clearly defined criteria for legal and editorial\n         assessments, and implemented according to a structured timeline. Stakeholder feedback\n         and comments provided in accordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with\n         stakeholders”7 shall be considered, as relevant. In addition, the secretariat shall provide\n         the Supervisory Body regular updates on the progress and status of each review, including\n         key findings and any proposed regulatory amendments. Final approved changes and\n         review outcomes shall be made available through the UNFCCC website.\n14.      Periodic reviews shall be undertaken by the secretariat once approved by the Supervisory\n         Body, and may be triggered by, inter alia:\n         (a)     Scheduled intervals;\n         (b)     New CMA guidance that requires updates to the Article 6.4 mechanism's\n                 operations;\n         (c)     Identification by the Supervisory Body of issues that need to be addressed;\n         (d)     Identification of gaps or weaknesses discovered through implementation\n                 experience or stakeholder feedback; and\n         (e)     Findings from other review processes or other relevant developments that may\n                 necessitate adjustments to the Article 6.4 mechanism's operations.\n\n5.1.     Objectives\n15.      The periodic review system aims to achieve the following objectives:\n         (a)     Establish a structured process for the periodic legal and editorial reviews\n                 and the refinement of the Supervisory Body's regulatory documents. This\n                 process aims to identify issues to consider in relation to relevant international\n                 environmental agreements, relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the\n                 Supervisory Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”.\n         (b)     Improve transparency, legal clarity, and coherence across regulatory\n                 documents to support the smooth operation of the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n6\n    See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-\n    body/rules-and-regulations. The review of individual methodologies, methodological tools, standardized\n    baselines, which are under the purview of the Methodology Expert Panel (MEP), are not within the\n    scope of the periodic legal and editorial review.\n7   A6.4-PROC-GOV-007 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-007.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                    5 of 10\nA6.4-PROC-GOV-008\nProcedure: Periodic structured legal and editorial review system of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body’s\nregulatory documents\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n               As the mechanism operates within a global climate regime, transparency is crucial\n               for building trust among Parties, private sector actors, and civil society. Regular\n               reviews will help identify and correct inconsistencies or ambiguities, ensuring\n               internal coherence and harmonization with relevant frameworks;\n       (c)     Enhance readability and clarity of the regulations for both technical and non-\n               technical audiences, ensuring transparent communication of regulatory\n               requirements. This will ensure that the legal language used is robust, clear, and\n               aligned with evolving international legal standards and practices, thereby\n               improving accessibility for all stakeholders;\n       (d)     Support continuous improvement and adaptability by establishing practices for\n               refining the regulatory framework based on lessons learned, stakeholder feedback,\n               regulatory developments, and emerging needs;\n       (e)     Promote regulatory stability by avoiding frequent substantive revisions to the\n               adopted standards, tools and procedures, while ensuring ongoing continuous\n               improvements;\n       (f)     Address any issues brought forward by the Supervisory Body or\n               stakeholders, which require legal or editorial clarification. These include providing\n               a formalized process to address specific legal or operational issues encountered\n               by the Supervisory Body promptly, ensuring the regulatory framework remains\n               clear and effective;\n       (g)     Enable meaningful and broad-based stakeholder input. Incorporate in\n               accordance with the “Procedure: Direct communication with stakeholders”, input\n               from Parties, non-Party stakeholders, and technical experts, consultations with\n               local communities including the knowledge, sciences and practices of Indigenous\n               Peoples, as relevant, to support its work. This will foster a transparent, inclusive,\n               and participatory approach to regulatory governance, and will help enhance the\n               credibility of the Supervisory Body and overall trust in the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n5.2.   Focus of the periodic review\n16.    The periodic review system shall focus on two main aspects:\n       (a)     Legal assessment: Ensuring the regulatory documents consistency with the Paris\n               Agreement, and relevant CMA guidance, the rules of procedure of the Supervisory\n               Body, and the “Decision and documentation framework”; as well as legal\n               coherence, consistency and clarity.\n       (b)     Editorial assessment: Ensuring that the regulatory documents are clear, concise,\n               and free from ambiguity or inconsistency in language.\n\n5.2.1. Legal assessment process\n17.    The legal assessment shall focus on ensuring the regulatory documents are legally sound,\n       and coherent.

Introduction\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted decision 3/CMA.3, containing in its annex\n          the “Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6,\n          paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement” (RMPs), setting out principles, key requirements and\n          processes of the mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the Article 6.4 mechanism). 1 The\n          aforementioned decision and the RMPs contain, inter alia, provisions for the Supervisory\n          Body to advance work related to methodologies and standardized baselines.\n2.        Given the mandates above, the Supervisory Body included the provisions to develop the\n          process for the development, consideration, and approval of methodologies,\n          methodological tools, and standardized baselines in its workplan for 2022–2023,2 with the\n          aim to complete the process by 2023.\n\n2.        Scope, applicability and entry into force\n2.1.      Scope\n3.        This procedure defines the processes for the development of new methodologies and\n          methodological tools,3 the revision of approved methodologies and methodological tools,\n          and the provision for clarifications of approved methodologies and methodological tools.\n\n2.2.      Applicability\n4.

The secretariat shall also explore\n       various means (e.g., setting up a mailing list for interested stakeholders, holding webinars)\n       to reach out to a wide range of stakeholders. The duration of the period for submission of\n       comments for the global stakeholder consultation shall be 21 days. After this period, the\n       secretariat shall make the comments received publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n5.1.4. Preparation of draft recommendation\n18.    The secretariat shall prepare a draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert Panel\n       on the proposed new methodology or methodological tool for which the submission has\n       been deemed qualified, taking into account the comments received in the global\n\n\n\n                                                7 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       stakeholder consultation, and using the “Form: New baseline and monitoring methodology\n       or methodological tool recommendation”.\n19.    In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may, taking into account the\n       appendix to this procedure, propose that a new or revised consolidated methodology be\n       prepared covering the scope and applicability of the proposed new methodology, by\n       merging it with an approved methodology or revised methodology currently being\n       developed under this procedure. In this case, the subsequent paragraphs in\n       section 5.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n20.    In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n       depending on the technical complexity of the proposed new methodology or\n       methodological tool, by selecting a maximum of two independent experts to review the\n       submission. For this purpose, the secretariat shall use a roster of methodological experts\n       established by the Supervisory Body. If the secretariat does not find suitable and available\n       experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the roster.\n21.    The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft recommendation to them for their review. The selected members shall provide\n       input on the draft recommendation within five days of receipt of it.\n22.    Furthermore, in preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected\n       members of the Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group\n       comprised of the sectoral experts on the roster. For the purpose of this consultation, the\n       roster of methodological experts may be grouped into several working groups (e.g.\n       working group for renewable energy, working group for transport, working group for\n       waste).\n23.    The secretariat shall finalize the recommendation, taking into account the input from the\n       selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel and the relevant working group,\n       and submit it to the Methodological Expert Panel for consideration at its meeting in\n       accordance with paragraph 9 above, at the latest seven days before the meeting.\n\n5.1.5. Consideration by Methodological Expert Panel\n24.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to initiate the consideration of\n       proposals submitted on time at the meeting, based on guidance from the chair of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel, taking into account the priorities of the Supervisory Body as\n       described below.\n25.    The Supervisory Body may prioritize, as needed, the development or approval of a new\n       methodology or methodological tool, based on factors such as relevance for least\n       developed countries and small island developing States, host country priorities\n       communicated to the Supervisory Body, potential for transformative climate action at a\n       global or regional scale, potential for programmatic approaches, and participation of small\n       and micro businesses.\n26.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the inputs referred in paragraph 23 above\n       and prepare a draft recommendation for the Supervisory Body. The secretariat shall\n       enable stakeholders to provide comments to the Methodological Expert Panel throughout\n       the methodology approval process (i.e., as inputs to the drafts of the Methodological\n\n\n\n\n                                                8 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       Expert Panel meetings). The Methodological Expert Panel shall take into account the\n       comments received in preparing the draft recommendation.\n27.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to conclude its consideration and\n       finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory Body within three consecutive meetings,\n       subject to the prioritization referred in paragraph 25. The recommendation to the\n       Supervisory Body shall be to either:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed new methodology or methodological tool (“A case”); or\n       (b)     Reject the proposed new methodology or methodological tool (“C case”).\n28.    In preparing the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert\n       Panel may, taking into account the appendix to this procedure, prepare a draft new or\n       revised consolidated methodology covering the scope and applicability of the proposed\n       new methodology, by merging it with an approved methodology or revised methodology\n       currently being developed under this procedure. In this case, the subsequent paragraphs\n       in section 5.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n29.    If, in preparing the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body, the Methodological\n       Expert Panel identifies issues in the proposed new methodology or methodological tool\n       that may be addressed with clarifications or modifications, the Methodological Expert\n       Panel shall request the secretariat to communicate the issues to the proponent (“B case”).\n       In this case, the proponent shall provide clarifications or submit a modified proposed new\n       methodology or methodological tool to address the identified issues to the secretariat\n       within 28 days of the communication being made. If the proponent does not respond\n       accordingly by this deadline, the panel’s submission of a final recommendation to the\n       Supervisory Body may be delayed accordingly. If the proponent does not respond\n       accordingly within 90 days, the submission shall be considered withdrawn. The secretariat\n       shall publish the issues raised by the Methodological Expert Panel and the clarifications\n       or the modified proposed new methodology or methodological tool submitted by the\n       proponent on the UNFCCC website.\n30.    If the Methodological Expert Panel’s draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body is to\n       approve the proposed new methodology or methodological tool, the secretariat shall\n       communicate a reformatted new methodology or methodological tool to the proponent\n       before the conclusion of the meeting at which the proposal is considered. The proponent\n       shall, within the time frame defined by the Methodological Expert Panel, confirm that the\n       reformatted new methodology or methodological tool is acceptable or request\n       modifications to it, in order that the Methodological Expert Panel can finalize a\n       recommendation to the Supervisory Body by the end of the meeting. If the proponent does\n       not respond by this deadline, the panel’s submission of a final recommendation to the\n       Supervisory Body may be delayed accordingly.\n31.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory\n       Body, taking into account the proponent’s responses referred to in paragraphs 29 and 30\n       above, and publish it in its corresponding meeting report. The secretariat shall place the\n       recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body\n       meeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n5.1.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n32.    At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       from the Methodological Expert Panel is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall\n       decide whether to:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed new methodology or methodological tool as recommended\n               by the Methodological Expert Panel;\n       (b)     Reject the proposed new methodology or methodological tool; or\n       (c)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the\n               Supervisory Body and provide guidance to the Methodological Expert Panel on the\n               issues to be reviewed.\n33.    If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed new methodology or methodological tool,\n       the secretariat shall publish the approved new methodology or methodological tool on the\n       UNFCCC website within seven days of the approval.\n\n5.1.7. Other\n34.    The secretariat shall maintain on the UNFCCC website a publicly available list of all\n       proposed new methodologies or methodological tools deemed qualified for consideration\n       by the Methodological Expert Panel and the Supervisory Body, indicating the current\n       status in the process. The secretariat shall publish all background documents related to\n       the rationale for approval, rejection and any options for resubmissions.\n35.    At any step before the Supervisory Body makes a final decision, the secretariat may\n       request the proponent to provide additional information regarding the proposed new\n       methodology or methodological tool within a defined time frame to facilitate the\n       assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel and/or the Supervisory Body. If such information significantly affects the outcome\n       of the assessment/consideration, the secretariat shall make the information publicly\n       available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n5.2.   Top-down process\n\n5.2.1. Initiation\n36.    The Supervisory Body may decide to develop a new methodology (including a new\n       consolidated methodology) or methodological tool at any time. The Supervisory Body may\n       consider giving priority to the development of a new methodology or methodological tool\n       based on various factors. These factors include its relevance to least developed countries\n       and small island developing States, the priorities of the host country as communicated to\n       the Supervisory Body, the potential for transformative climate action on a global or regional\n       scale, the potential for programmatic approaches, and the participation of small and micro\n       businesses.\n37.    The Methodological Expert Panel, or the secretariat may propose to the Supervisory Body\n       that it develop a new methodology (including a new consolidated methodology) or\n       methodological tool at any time. In this case, the Supervisory Body shall consider the\n       proposal and decide whether to develop such methodology or methodological tool.\n\n\n\n\n                                               10 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2.

A request for revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool shall not include\n         proposed changes to the methodology or methodological tool that would result in the\n         exclusion, restriction or narrowing of the applicability conditions of the methodology or\n         methodological tool as a whole for other projects or PoAs. If a proponent wishes that an\n         approved methodology be revised in the way to exclude, restrict or narrow the applicability\n         conditions of the methodology for other projects or PoAs, the proponent shall propose a\n\n10\n     The Supervisory Body may specify conditions under which proponents may seek comments and\n     feedback from the secretariat prior to making a formal submission (e.g., for methodologies intended for\n     application in least developed countries/small Island developing States).\n11\n     Completing the entire PDD form is not required; only the listed sections are required to illustrate the\n     application of the methodology.\n\n\n\n                                                  13 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       new methodology in accordance with section 5.1 above. If a request for revision of an\n       approved methodology is likely to result in the addition of new procedures or scenarios to\n       more than half of the provisions of the methodology, the proponent should propose a new\n       methodology in accordance with section 5.1 above.\n\n6.1.2. Completeness check\n55.    The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check of the submission within seven days\n       of the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 52 above.\n56.    If the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall request the proponent to\n       submit the missing or revised documents and/or information. In this case, the proponent\n       shall submit the requested documents and/or information to the secretariat within five days\n       of receipt of the request. If the proponent does not submit the requested documents and/or\n       information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the submission is\n       incomplete and stop further processing of the submission.\n57.    Upon conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall notify the proponent of\n       the conclusion of the completeness check. If the submission is concluded as incomplete\n       in accordance with paragraph 56 above, the secretariat shall also communicate the\n       underlying reason(s) to the proponent. In this case, the proponent may resubmit the\n       proposed revised methodology or methodological tool with revised documentation at any\n       time. Upon submission, the revised documentation shall be treated as a new submission\n       of a request for revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool under this\n       procedure.\n\n6.1.3. Initial assessment\n58.    Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall conduct an initial\n       assessment of the submission using the “Form: Approved baseline and monitoring\n       methodology/methodological tool revision request initial assessment” within 30 days of\n       the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 52 above, to determine whether the\n       submission qualifies for consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel and the\n       Supervisory Body.\n59.    If, during the initial assessment, the secretariat identifies minor issues in the submission,\n       it shall request the proponent to submit the missing or revised documents and/or\n       information. In this case, the proponent shall submit the requested documents and/or\n       information to the secretariat within five days of receipt of the request. If the proponent\n       does not submit the requested documents and/or information by this deadline, the\n       secretariat shall conclude that the submission is incomplete and stop further processing\n       of the submission.\n60.    Upon conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall notify the proponent of the\n       conclusion of the initial assessment. If the submission is concluded as unqualified for\n       consideration, or incomplete in accordance with paragraph 59 above, the secretariat shall\n       also communicate the underlying reason(s) to the proponent. In this case, the proponent\n       may resubmit the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool with revised\n       documentation at any time. Upon submission, the revised documentation shall be treated\n       as a new submission of a request for revision of an approved methodology or\n       methodological tool under this procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                               14 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n61.    If the submission is concluded as qualified for consideration by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel and the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall make the submission publicly\n       available on the UNFCCC website for global stakeholder consultation. To facilitate broader\n       participation, the secretariat shall publish a simplified summary of the methodology or\n       methodological tool. The secretariat shall also explore various means (e.g., setting up a\n       mailing list for interested stakeholders, holding webinars) to reach out to a wide range of\n       stakeholders. The duration of the period for submission of comments for the global\n       stakeholder consultation shall be 21 days. After this period, the secretariat shall make all\n       comments received publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.1.4. Preparation of draft recommendation\n62.    The secretariat shall prepare a draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert Panel\n       on the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool for which the submission has\n       been deemed qualified, taking into account the comments received in the global\n       stakeholder consultation, and using the “Form: Approved baseline and monitoring\n       methodology/methodological tool revision recommendation” .\n63.    In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may, taking into account the\n       appendix to this procedure, propose that a new or revised consolidated methodology be\n       prepared covering the scope and applicability of the proposed revised methodology, by\n       merging it with an approved methodology or other new or revised methodology currently\n       being developed under this procedure. In this case, the subsequent paragraphs in\n       section 6.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n64.    In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n       depending on the technical complexity of the proposed revised methodology or\n       methodological tool, by selecting a maximum of two independent experts from the roster\n       of experts referred to in paragraph 20 above to review the submission. If the secretariat\n       does not find suitable and available experts on the roster, it may use the services of\n       experts not included on the roster.\n65.    The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft recommendation to them for their review. The selected members shall provide\n       input on the draft recommendation within five days of receipt of it.\n66.    In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in\n       paragraph 20 above.\n67.    The secretariat shall finalize the recommendation, taking into account the input from the\n       selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel and the relevant working group,\n       and submit it to the Methodological Expert Panel for consideration at its meeting in\n       accordance with paragraph 52 above, at the latest seven days before the meeting.\n\n6.1.5. Consideration by Methodological Expert Panel\n68.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to initiate the consideration of\n       the requests submitted on time at the meeting, based on guidance from the chair of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel for that meeting, taking into account the priorities of the\n       Supervisory Body as described above.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n69.    The Supervisory Body may prioritize, as needed, the revision of an approved methodology\n       or methodological tool, based on factors such as relevance for least developed countries\n       and small island developing States, host country priorities communicated to the\n       Supervisory Body, potential for transformative climate action at a global or regional scale,\n       potential for programmatic approaches, and participation of small and micro businesses.\n70.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the inputs referred in paragraph 67 above\n       and prepare a draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body. The secretariat shall enable\n       stakeholders to provide comments to the Methodological Expert Panel throughout the\n       methodology approval process (i.e., as inputs to the drafts of the Methodological Expert\n       Panel meetings). The Methodological Expert Panel shall take into account the comments\n       received in preparing the draft recommendation.\n71.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to conclude its consideration and\n       finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory Body within two consecutive meetings,\n       subject to the prioritization referred in paragraph 69. The recommendation to the\n       Supervisory Body shall be to either:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool (“A case”); or\n       (b)     Reject the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool (“C case”).\n72.    In preparing the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert\n       Panel may, taking into account the appendix to this procedure, prepare a draft new or\n       revised consolidated methodology covering the scope and applicability of the proposed\n       revised methodology, by merging it with an approved methodology or other new or revised\n       methodology currently being developed under this procedure. In this case, the subsequent\n       paragraphs in section 6.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n73.    In preparing the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert\n       Panel may request the proponent to submit a draft PDD or PoA-DD that intends to apply\n       the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool, in order to facilitate its\n       consideration if it had not been submitted in the original submission of the request for\n       revision. Also, if the Methodological Expert Panel identifies issues in the proposed revised\n       methodology or methodological tool that may be addressed with clarifications or\n       modifications, the Methodological Expert Panel shall request the secretariat to\n       communicate the issues to the proponent (“B case”). In these cases, the proponent shall\n       submit a draft PDD or PoA-DD, provide clarifications or submit a modified proposed\n       revised methodology or methodological tool as applicable to the secretariat within 28 days\n       of the communication being made. If the proponent does not respond accordingly by this\n       deadline, the panel’s submission of a final recommendation to the Supervisory Body may\n       be delayed accordingly. If the proponent does not respond accordingly within 90 days, the\n       submission shall be considered withdrawn. The secretariat shall publish the issues raised\n       by the Methodological Expert Panel and the clarifications or the modified proposed revised\n       methodology or methodological tool submitted by the proponent on the UNFCCC website.\n74.    If the Methodological Expert Panel’s draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body is to\n       approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool, the secretariat shall\n       communicate a reformatted revised methodology or methodological tool to the proponent\n       before the conclusion of the meeting at which the proposal is considered. The proponent\n       shall, within the time frame defined by the Methodological Expert Panel, confirm that the\n       reformatted revised methodology or methodological tool is acceptable or request\n\n\n\n                                               16 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       modifications to it, in order that the Methodological Expert Panel can finalize a\n       recommendation to the Supervisory Body by the end of the meeting. If the proponent does\n       not respond by this deadline, the panel’s submission of a final recommendation to the\n       Supervisory Body may be delayed accordingly.\n75.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory\n       Body, taking into account the proponent’s responses referred to in paragraphs 73 and 74\n       above, and publish it in its corresponding meeting report. For a proposed revised\n       methodological tool, if the recommendation is to approve the proposed revised\n       methodological tool, it shall also include a list of the existing approved methodologies that\n       would need to be revised due to the effectiveness of the revised methodological tool. The\n       secretariat shall place the recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting.\n\n6.1.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n76.    At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       from the Methodological Expert Panel is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall\n       decide to:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool as\n               recommended by the Methodological Expert Panel, indicating that:\n               (i)    The revision is a major revision; or\n               (ii)   The revision is a minor revision;\n       (b)     Reject the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool; or\n       (c)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the\n               Supervisory Body and provide guidance to the Methodological Expert Panel on the\n               issues to be reviewed.\n77.    If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodology or methodological\n       tool, the secretariat shall publish the approved revised methodology or methodological tool\n       on the UNFCCC website within seven days of the approval.\n78.    If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodological tool, it shall\n       request the Methodological Expert Panel to prepare draft revised methodologies to\n       introduce or modify references to the revised methodological tool in them, based on the\n       list in the recommendation from the Methodological Expert Panel referred to in paragraph\n       75 above, following the process referred to in sections 6.2.2−6.2.4 below.\n\n6.1.7. Other\n79.    The secretariat shall maintain on the UNFCCC website a publicly available list of all\n       proposed revised methodologies and methodological tools deemed qualified for\n       consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel and the Supervisory Body, indicating\n       the current status in the process. The secretariat shall publish all background documents\n       related to the rationale for approval, rejection, and any options for resubmission.\n80.    At any step before the Supervisory Body makes a final decision, the secretariat may\n       request the proponent to provide additional information regarding the proposed revised\n       methodology or methodological tool within a defined time frame to facilitate the\n\n\n\n                                               17 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel and/or the Supervisory Body. If such information significantly affects the outcome\n       of the assessment/consideration, the secretariat shall make the information publicly\n       available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.2.   Top-down process\n\n6.2.1. Initiation\n81.    The Supervisory Body may, taking into account the appendix to this procedure, decide to\n       revise an approved methodology (including an approved consolidated methodology) or\n       methodological tool at any time. The Supervisory Body may consider giving priority to the\n       revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool based on various factors.\n       These factors include its relevance to least developed countries and small island\n       developing States, the priorities of the host country as communicated to the Supervisory\n       Body, the potential for transformative climate action on a global or regional scale, the\n       potential for programmatic approaches, and the participation of small and micro\n       businesses.\n82.    In this case, the Supervisory Body shall also decide to:\n       (a)     Put on hold the approved methodology or methodological tool, with immediate\n               effect. In this case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the\n               UNFCCC website, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, any\n               request for registration or any request for renewal of crediting period of a project\n               or PoA applying the methodology or methodological tool from the day following the\n               date of publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the\n               decision;\n       (b)     Put on hold the approved methodology or methodological tool, with a grace period\n               of 28 days. In this case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on\n               the UNFCCC website, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation,\n               any request for registration or any request for renewal of crediting period of a\n               project or PoA, applying the methodology or methodological tool any more\n               than 28 days following the date of publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting\n               report containing the decision; or\n       (c)     Maintain the current version of the approved methodology or methodological tool\n               until the expiry of its validity, in accordance with paragraphs 99−101 below.\n83.    The Methodological Expert Panel, or the secretariat, may, taking into account the\n       appendix to this procedure, propose that the Supervisory Body revise an approved\n       methodology (including an approved consolidated methodology) or methodological tool at\n       any time. If the Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat considers that the current\n       version of the methodology or methodological tool should be put on hold, it shall\n       recommend so to the Supervisory Body. In these cases, the Supervisory Body shall\n       consider the proposal and/or the recommendation, and decide whether to revise and/or to\n       put on hold the current version of the methodology or methodological tool in accordance\n       with paragraph 81 above.\n84.    Notwithstanding paragraph 83 above, if a member of the Methodological Expert Panel, or\n       the secretariat, finds that it is necessary to revise an approved methodology or\n\n\n\n                                               18 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       methodological tool to correct an obvious error, the chair and the vice-chair of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel may decide to directly initiate the revision.\n\n6.2.2. Preparation of draft revised methodology or methodological tool\n85.    If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved methodology or methodological\n       tool in accordance with paragraph 82 or 83 above, or the chair and the vice-chair of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel decide to revise it in accordance with paragraph 84 above,\n       the secretariat shall prepare a draft revised methodology or methodological tool.\n86.    In preparing the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, the secretariat may\n       draw upon external expertise, depending on the technical complexity of the revision, by\n       selecting a maximum of two independent experts from the roster of experts referred to in\n       paragraph 20 above, to review the draft revised methodology or methodological tool. If the\n       secretariat does not find suitable and available experts on the roster, it may use the\n       services of experts not included on the roster.\n87.    The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft revised methodology or methodological tool to them for their review. The selected\n       members shall provide input on the draft revised methodology or methodological tool\n       within five days of receipt of it.\n88.    In preparing the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, the secretariat and the\n       selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant\n       working group referred to in paragraph 20 above.\n89.    The secretariat shall finalize the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, taking\n       into account the input from the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel and\n       the relevant working group, and submit it to the Methodological Expert Panel for\n       consideration at its meeting, at the latest seven days before the meeting.\n\n6.2.3. Consideration by Methodological Expert Panel\n90.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the draft revised methodology or\n       methodological tool and prepare a draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the\n       draft revised methodology or methodological tool.\n91.    The secretariat shall make the draft recommendation to the Supervisory Body publicly\n       available on the UNFCCC website for global stakeholder consultation. To facilitate broader\n       participation, the secretariat shall publish a simplified summary of the methodology or\n       methodological tool. The secretariat shall also explore various means (e.g., setting up a\n       mailing list for interested stakeholders, holding webinars) to reach out to a wide range of\n       stakeholders. The duration of the period for submission of comments for the global\n       stakeholder consultation shall be 21 days. After this period, the secretariat shall make all\n       comments received publicly available on the UNFCCC website. If the revision of an\n       approved methodology or methodological tool has been initiated in accordance with\n       paragraph 51, 78, 84 above, or 95 below, global stakeholder consultation is not necessary.\n92.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the recommendation to the Supervisory\n       Body on the draft revised methodology or methodological tool, taking into account the\n       comments received in the global stakeholder consultation, and publish it in its\n       corresponding meeting report. For a draft revised methodological tool, the\n       recommendation shall also include a list of the existing approved methodologies that\n\n\n\n                                               19 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       would need to be revised due to the effectiveness of the revised methodological tool. The\n       secretariat shall place the recommendation to the Supervisory Body on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting.\n\n6.2.4. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n93.    At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       from the Methodological Expert Panel is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall\n       decide to:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool, indicating that:\n               (i)    The revision is a major revision; or\n               (ii)   The revision is a minor revision;\n       (b)     Reject the proposed revised methodology or methodological tool; or\n       (c)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the\n               Supervisory Body and provide guidance to the Methodological Expert Panel on the\n               issues to be reviewed.\n94.    If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodology or methodological\n       tool, the secretariat shall publish the approved revised methodology or methodological tool\n       on the UNFCCC website within seven days of the approval.\n95.    If the Supervisory Body approves the proposed revised methodological tool, it shall\n       request the Methodological Expert Panel to prepare draft revised methodologies to\n       introduce or modify references to the revised methodological tool in them, based on the\n       list in the recommendation from the Methodological Expert Panel referred to in paragraph\n       92 above, following the process referred to in sections 6.2.2−6.2.4 above.\n\n6.2.5. Other\n96.    The secretariat may propose an editorial revision to an approved methodology or\n       methodological tool at any time. In this case, the secretariat shall submit a draft revised\n       methodology or methodological tool to the chair of the Methodological Expert Panel for\n       his/her review. If the chair agrees to the draft revised methodology or methodological tool,\n       the secretariat shall publish the revised methodology or methodological tool on the\n       UNFCCC website. The editorial revision shall be noted in the next meeting report of the\n       Supervisory Body.\n\n7.     Update of approved methodology or methodological tool\n97.    All approved methodologies and methodological tools that have been applied in projects\n       shall be reviewed at least once every five years based on the latest scientific information.\n       The Methodological Expert Panel shall review relevant information, consult with the public\n       and experts as necessary, and prepare a recommendation for consideration by the\n       Supervisory Body for updating the methodologies and methodological tools where\n       necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                               20 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n8.     Validity of new, revised and previous versions\n98.    An approved new or revised methodology or methodological tool shall be effective from\n       the date of publication on the UNFCCC website. From this date, a project or PoA may\n       apply the new or revised version for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for\n       global stakeholder consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of\n       a request for renewal of crediting period, in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4\n       mechanism activity cycle.”\n99.    If the Supervisory Body approves a revised methodology or methodological tool indicating\n       that it is a major revision in accordance with paragraph 76(a)(i) or 93(a)(i) above, the\n       version number of the methodology or methodological tool shall increase by one whole\n       number (e.g. from 1.0 to 2.0), and the previous version shall continue to be valid\n       for 240 days from the date that the revised version becomes effective unless the previous\n       version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a)\n       or 81(b) above. In this case, for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global\n       stakeholder consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of a\n       request for renewal of crediting period in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4\n       mechanism activity cycle”:\n       (a)     A project or PoA may still apply the previous version during this 240-day period\n               unless the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in\n               accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above; and\n       (b)     A project or PoA shall apply the revised version after this 240-day period, or\n               immediately after its adoption if the previous version has been put on hold in\n               accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. If a PDD or PoA-DD applying the\n               previous version has already been published for global stakeholder consultation,\n               the project participants or coordinating/managing entity shall revise the PDD or\n               PoA-DD applying the revised version. In this case, the DOE shall not publish the\n               revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, but submit it when it\n               submits a request for registration unless otherwise decided by the Supervisory\n               Body when it approves the revised methodology or methodological tool.\n100.   If the Supervisory Body approves a revised methodology or methodological tool indicating\n       that it is a minor revision in accordance with paragraph 76(a)(ii) or 93(a)(ii) above, or if an\n       editorial revision to an approved methodology or methodological tool has been made in\n       accordance with paragraph 96 above, the version number of the methodology or\n       methodological tool shall increase by one fractional number (e.g. from 1.0 to 1.1), and the\n       previous version shall continue to be valid until the next revision for mandatory use. In this\n       case, for the purpose of publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder\n       consultation, submission of a request for registration, or submission of a request for\n       renewal of crediting period in accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism\n       activity cycle”, a project activity or PoA may still apply the previous version or any earlier\n       version until the end of the 240-day period after the next major revision.\n101.   If the Supervisory Body approves a new or revised consolidated methodology or\n       methodological tool, the approved methodology or methodological tool that has been\n       consolidated shall continue to be valid for 240 days from the date when the consolidated\n       methodology or methodological tool becomes effective unless the approved methodology\n       or methodological tool that has been consolidated has been put on hold by the Supervisory\n       Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. In this case, for the purpose of\n\n\n\n                                               21 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submission of a\n       request for registration, or submission of a request for renewal of crediting period in\n       accordance with the “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle”:\n       (a)     A project or PoA may still apply the methodology or methodological tool that has\n               been consolidated during this 240-day period unless it has been put on hold by the\n               Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above; and\n       (b)     A project or PoA shall apply the consolidated methodology or methodological tool\n               after this 240-day period, or immediately after its adoption if the methodology or\n               methodological tool that has been consolidated has been put on hold in\n               accordance with paragraph 81(a) or 81(b) above. If a PDD or PoA-DD applying the\n               methodology or methodological tool that has been consolidated has already been\n               published for global stakeholder consultation, the project participants or\n               coordinating/managing entity shall revise the PDD or PoA-DD applying the\n               consolidated methodology. In this case, the DOE shall not publish the revised PDD\n               or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation but submit it when it submits a\n               request for registration unless otherwise decided by the Supervisory Body when it\n               approves the revised methodology or methodological tool.\n102.   For the purpose of publication of a monitoring report and submission of a request for\n       issuance, a project or PoA shall apply the version of the methodology or methodological\n       tool that the project or PoA has been registered with. If the project participants or\n       coordinating/managing entity wish to use a later version of the methodology or\n       methodological tool for the purpose of monitoring of emission reductions or removals after\n       the registration of the project or PoA, or a DOE, when performing a verification, determines\n       that permanent changes to the monitoring plan as described in the registered PDD or\n       PoA-DD, generic CPA-DD, or the monitoring methodology have occurred or expected to\n       occur, the DOE shall submit a request for approval by the Supervisory Body prior to the\n       submission of the request for issuance in accordance with the relevant provisions of the\n       “Procedure: Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle”.\n103.   The revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool or the consolidation of\n       methodologies or methodological tools shall not affect registered projects or PoAs until\n       the end of the crediting periods during which the validity of the version of the methodology\n       or methodological tool applied to the project or PoA expires.\n\n9.     Clarification of approved methodology or\n       methodological tool\n9.1.   Bottom-up process\n\n9.1.1. Submission of request for clarification\n104.   The secretariat shall publish the schedules of the meetings of the Methodological Expert\n       Panel and the deadlines for the submission of requests for clarification of an approved\n       methodology or methodological tool to be considered by the Methodological Expert Panel\n       at the corresponding meeting. The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to\n       initiate the consideration of the requests submitted on time at the meeting, taking into\n       account the priorities set by the chair of the Methodological Expert Panel for that meeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                               22 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n105.   The project participants of a planned project or PoA, the coordinating/managing entity of\n       a planned PoA, a host Party, a DOE or any other stakeholder (hereinafter in section 9.1\n       referred to as the enquirer) may, taking into account the appendix to this procedure,\n       request clarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool, by submitting,\n       through a specific interface on the UNFCCC website, the duly completed “Form: Approved\n       baseline and monitoring methodology/methodological tool clarification request” to the\n       secretariat.\n\n9.1.2. Completeness check\n       The secretariat shall conduct a completeness check of the submission within seven days\n       of the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 104 above.\n107.   If the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall request the enquirer to\n       submit the missing or revised documents and/or information. In this case, the enquirer\n       shall submit the requested documents and/or information to the secretariat within five days\n       of receipt of the request. If the enquirer does not submit the requested documents and/or\n       information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the submission is\n       incomplete and stop further processing of the submission.\n       Upon conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall notify the enquirer of the\n       conclusion of the completeness check. If the submission is concluded as incomplete in\n       accordance with paragraph 107 above, the secretariat shall communicate the underlying\n       reason(s) to the enquirer. In this case, the enquirer may resubmit the request for\n       clarification with revised documentation at any time. Upon submission, the revised\n       documentation shall be treated as a new submission of a request for clarification under\n       this procedure.\n\n9.1.3. Initial assessment\n109.   Upon positive conclusion of the completeness check, the secretariat shall conduct an initial\n       assessment of the submission using the “Form: Approved baseline and monitoring\n       methodology/methodological tool clarification request initial assessment” within 15 days\n       of the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 104 above, to determine either\n       that:\n       (a)     It does not involve any regulatory and/or technical ambiguity, or involves only\n               simple regulatory and/or technical issues, hence requires no analysis or only a\n               simple analysis to formulate a clarification; or\n       (b)     It involves complex regulatory and/or technical issues, hence requires a thorough\n               analysis to formulate a clarification.\n\n9.1.4. Fast track\n110.   If the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 109(a) above,\n       the secretariat shall prepare a clarification using the “Form: Approved baseline and\n       monitoring methodology/methodological tool clarification response” and send it to the\n       enquirer within 30 days of the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 104\n       above.\n111.   In preparing the clarification, the secretariat may consult with the Methodological Expert\n       Panel. In this case, the timeline referred in paragraph 110 above shall not apply. The\n\n\n\n                                               23 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n       secretariat shall send a draft clarification to the Methodological Expert Panel within\n       30 days of the deadline for submissions referred to in paragraph 104 above. If no member\n       of the Methodological Expert Panel objects to the draft clarification within seven days of\n       receipt of the draft clarification, the clarification shall be deemed finalized by the\n       Methodological Expert Panel. If a member of the Methodological Expert Panel objects to\n       the draft clarification, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel and be treated under the regular track from the step referred\n       to in paragraph 115 below. At the meeting where the case is placed on the agenda, the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to finalize the clarification within one\n       meeting.\n112.   The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website, specifying to which\n       version(s) of the methodology or methodological tool the clarification applies.\n\n9.1.5. Regular track\n113.   If the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 109(b) above,\n       the secretariat shall prepare a draft recommendation of a clarification to the\n       Methodological Expert Panel using the “Form: Approved baseline and monitoring\n       methodology/methodological tool clarification response” .\n114.   In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n       depending on the technical complexity of the issues in question, by selecting a maximum\n       of two independent experts from the roster of experts referred to in paragraph 20 above\n       to review the submission. If the secretariat does not find suitable and available experts on\n       the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the roster.\n115.   The secretariat shall select one member of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft recommendation to him/her for review. The selected member shall provide input\n       on the draft recommendation within three days of receipt of it.\n116.   In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in\n       paragraph 20 above.\n117.   The secretariat shall finalize the recommendation, taking into account the input from the\n       selected member, and submit it to the Methodological Expert Panel and the relevant\n       working group for consideration at its meeting in accordance with paragraph 104 above,\n       at the latest seven days before the meeting.\n118.   The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the recommendation, finalize the\n       recommendation and forward it to the Supervisory Body and publish it in its corresponding\n       meeting report. The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to finalize the\n       recommendation within one meeting.\n119.   If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation above within 28\n       days of receipt of the recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be\n       deemed to be the decision adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n120.   An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n                                               24 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n121.   If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days\n       prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n122.   At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall decide to either:\n       (a)     Approve the recommended clarification, specifying to which version(s) of the\n               methodology or methodological tool the clarification applies; or\n       (b)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the\n               Supervisory Body and provide guidance to the Methodological Expert Panel on the\n               issues to be reviewed.\n123.   If the Supervisory Body approves the clarification, the secretariat shall send the finalized\n       clarification to the enquirer.\n124.   The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website.\n\n9.1.6. Other\n125.   The secretariat shall maintain on the UNFCCC website a publicly available list of all\n       requests for clarification that have been concluded as complete in accordance with\n       paragraphs 106−108 above, indicating the current status in the process.\n126.   At any step before the clarification is finalized in accordance with paragraph 110, 111 or\n       122(a) above, the secretariat may request the enquirer to provide additional information\n       regarding the request for clarification within a defined time frame to facilitate the\n       assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel. If such information significantly affects the outcome of the consideration, the\n       secretariat shall make the information publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n9.2.   Top-down process\n       If the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat finds it\n       necessary to clarify provisions of an approved methodology or methodological tool, the\n       process to revise the methodology or methodological tool as defined in section 6.2 above\n       shall be followed. In this case, the revised methodology or methodological tool shall\n       incorporate all relevant clarifications issued prior to the revision.\n\n\n\n\n                                               25 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\nAppendix.                 Principles for revision, consolidation                                       and\n                          clarification   of    methodologies                                          and\n                          methodological tools\n\n1.        Background\n1.        This appendix provides guiding principles for initiating a revision to an approved\n          methodology or methodological tool, for initiating a consolidation of methodologies in\n          accordance with the relevant section of this procedure, and for initiating a (request for)\n          clarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool.\n\n2.        Principles for revision\n2.        A revision is the modification of an approved methodology or methodological tool in order\n          to improve it or broaden its scope and applicability.\n3.        A revision of an approved methodology or methodological tool may be carried out if one\n          or more of the following conditions apply:\n          (a)     New or generally accepted scientific evidence indicates that emission reductions\n                  or removal enhancements will be overestimated or underestimated based on the\n                  approved methodology or methodological tool or that the reductions or\n                  enhancements may not be real, measurable and verifiable;\n          (b)     The applicability conditions require broadening to include more potential project\n                  types or conditions for use;1\n          (c)     There are identified inconsistencies, errors and/or ambiguities in the language\n                  and/or formulae used within or between methodologies or methodological tools;\n          (d)     Further simplification (e.g. default values) is required to improve the user-\n                  friendliness of the approved methodology or methodological tool;\n          (e)     Key issues clarified through a request for clarification of the approved methodology\n                  or methodological tool in accordance with section 9 of this procedure are required\n                  to be incorporated in the approved methodology or methodological tool;\n          (f)     There are changes to a methodological tool to which an approved methodology\n                  refers to and the changes affect the provisions of the methodology.\n\n\n1\n     A request for revision is suitable for situations where an approved methodology or methodological tool\n     is not applicable to a project or PoA but the project or PoA is broadly similar to the project or PoAs to\n     which the approved methodology is applicable. Similarity is based on the nature (technology/measure)\n     of the project or PoA and the sources of the emissions affected by the project or PoA. For example, an\n     approved methodology may not be applicable as the sources of emissions affected by the project are\n     the same as those in the methodology but the technology/measure used in the project is not covered\n     under the applicability conditions; or the procedures provided in the methodology for estimating\n     emissions from sources are not applicable because of slight variations in the approach, flow of events\n     or structure chosen in the project.\n\n\n\n                                                   26 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n3.     Principles for consolidation\n4.     The aims of consolidating methodologies or methodological tools are to: (a) make a set of\n       approved methodologies or methodological tools more concise and user-friendly; and\n       (b) avoid possible inconsistencies between methodologies or methodological tools.\n       Consolidation results in the issuance of a new or revised approved consolidated\n       methodology or methodological tool.\n5.     A consolidation of two or more proposed new, proposed revised and/or approved\n       methodologies or methodological tools into a single methodology or methodological tool\n       may be carried out if:\n       (a)     These methodologies or methodological tools are similar in many of their core\n               components (e.g. applicability, approach, technology, measure, baseline\n               determination, demonstration of additionality, emission calculation); and\n       (b)     A new consolidated methodology or methodological tool can be drafted on the\n               basis of these methodologies or methodological tools, which will be applicable to\n               all the projects and PoAs that apply at least one of these methodologies or\n               methodological tools.\n6.     A consolidated methodology or methodological tool may also include elements from other\n       proposed new, proposed revised or approved methodologies or methodological tools that\n       are not part of the consolidation.\n7.     In consolidating methodologies or methodological tools, a balance has to be made\n       between reducing the number of methodologies or methodological tools available to\n       project participants and coordinating/managing entities in the database, and the\n       complexity of the methodologies and the methodological tools, in order to keep the\n       database of methodologies and methodological tools lean and concise.\n8.     If a consolidated methodology or methodological tool involves an approved methodology\n       or methodological tool, and the consolidated one fully covers the approved one having\n       been consolidated, then the consolidated one supersedes the approved one.\n9.     If the range of applicability conditions of a consolidated methodology or methodological\n       tool does not fully cover the combined range of applicability conditions of the approved\n       methodologies or methodological tools that have been consolidated, then the original\n       methodologies or methodological tools are not withdrawn, but revised so that their ranges\n       of applicability conditions are limited to the project types for which the consolidated\n       methodology is not applicable. In this case, the consolidation and the revision are carried\n       out simultaneously.\n\n4.     Principles for clarification\n10.    A clarification on an approved methodology or methodological tool is to clarify:\n       (a)     The applicability of the methodology or methodological tool to a specific (planned)\n               project or PoA;\n       (b)     Various procedures provided in the methodology or methodological tool, inter alia,\n               for identifying the baseline scenario, demonstrating additionality, estimating\n               baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage; or\n\n\n\n                                               27 of 28\nA6.4-PROC-METH-001\nProcedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n           (c)     Monitoring data and procedures provided in the approved methodology or\n                   methodological tool.\n11.        A clarification of an approved methodology or methodological tool may be requested if:\n           (a)     Any of the provisions of the approved methodology or methodological tool are\n                   unclear or ambiguous, and there is room for interpretation of the provisions; and/or\n           (b)     Rationale or further background information is needed regarding conditions under\n                   which the approved methodology or methodological tool is to be applied.\n\n                                                      -----\n\n\n                                         Document information\n\n Version         Date                   Description\n\n\n 01.1            6 October 2024         Corrective revision to paragraph 6 of sub-section 2.3, Entry into\n                                        Force.\n 01.0            13 July 2023           SB 006, Annex 4\n                                        Initial adoption.\n\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Procedure\n Business Function: Methodology\n Keywords: Article 6.4 mechanism, approving methodologies and tools, revising or withdrawing\n methodologies and tools, regulatory framework\n\n\n\n\n                                                      28 of 28\n"

Introduction\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted decision 3/CMA.3, containing in its annex\n          the “Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6,\n          paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement” (RMPs), setting out principles, key requirements and\n          processes of the mechanism (hereinafter referred to as the Article 6.4 mechanism). 1 The\n          aforementioned decision and the RMPs contain, inter alia, provisions for the Supervisory\n          Body to advance work related to methodologies and standardized baselines.\n2.        Given the mandates above, the Supervisory Body included the provisions to develop the\n          process for the development, consideration, and approval of methodologies,\n          methodological tools, and standardized baselines in its workplan for 2022–2023,2 with the\n          aim to complete the process by 2023.\n\n2.        Scope, applicability and entry into force\n2.1.      Scope\n3.        The “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized\n          baselines” (hereinafter referred to as this procedure) defines the process for the\n          development of new standardized baselines as well as for revising, clarifying, and\n          updating approved standardized baselines.\n\n2.2.      Applicability\n4.        This procedure applies to standardized baselines that may be applied for an Article 6.4\n          mechanism project or programme of activities (PoA).\n5.        A standardized baseline may also be developed for a group of Parties. The procedure for\n          the development of standardized baselines for a group of Parties is currently not covered\n          in this document; it will be approved by the Supervisory Body in the future.\n6.        This procedure does not contain the process to develop or revise a baseline and\n          monitoring methodology or methodological tool for the purpose of developing a proposed\n          standardized baseline, or for using the baseline and monitoring methodology together with\n          a proposed standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions.\n\n2.3.      Entry into force\n7.        Version 01.0 of this procedure enters into force on 31 March 2024.\n\n3.        Normative references\n8.        The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this\n          procedure:\n\n\n\n1\n     See document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at: https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.\n2\n     Available at: https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb002-a02.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                     3 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n          (a)    “Procedure: Activity cycle procedure for project activities” or “Procedure: Activity\n                 cycle procedure for programmes of activities”;\n          (b)    “Guideline: Quality assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment\n                 of standardized baselines”;\n          (c)    “Standard: Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines”;\n          (d)    “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring\n                 methodologies and methodological tools”.\n\n4.        Definitions\n9.        In addition to the definitions in the “Glossary: Article 6.4 mechanism terms”, the following\n          terms apply in this procedure:\n          (a)    “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;\n          (b)    “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action\n                 is recommended as particularly suitable;\n          (c)    “May” is used to indicate what is permitted;\n          (d)    “Proponent” is a Party, activity participant, international industry organization or\n                 admitted observer organization.\n\n5.        Development of a standardized baseline\n5.1.      Approaches to develop a standardized baseline\n10.       A standardized baseline shall be developed using one of the following approaches:\n          (a)    A methodological approach contained in an approved, proposed new or revised\n                 baseline and monitoring methodology;\n          (b)    A methodological approach contained in an approved, proposed new or revised\n                 methodological tool; or\n          (c)    The approach in the other relevant methodological standards and guidelines\n                 adopted by the Supervisory Body3.\n\n5.2.      Bottom-up process\n\n5.2.1. Submission of a proposed standardized baseline\n11.       It is the prerogative of the designated national authority (DNA) to propose a standardized\n          baseline. If an activity participant, an international industry organization, or an admitted\n          observer organization wishes to submit a standardized baseline, it shall contact the DNA\n          of the Party for which the standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, the proponent\n\n\n\n3\n     The Supervisory Body may develop further guidance on how to develop a standardized baseline based\n     on other approaches (e.g., a standardized baseline to address leakage or a standardized baseline to\n     determine the best available technology at a country level.)\n\n\n\n                                                 4 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n         shall ensure that the proposed standardized baseline complies 4 with the “Standard:\n         Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines,” including the\n         requirements related to the data coverage period, data currentness, and the validity5 of\n         standardized baselines. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed standardized\n         baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs 14‒17 below.\n12.      Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 10 above, if the proponent wishes to use a\n         combination of the approaches for the development of the proposed standardized\n         baseline, or deviate from the selected approach due to a specific issue of the sector or\n         geographical area (e.g. country or region),6 the proponent shall provide a justification for\n         the necessity and the appropriateness of such combination or deviation in the submission\n         of the proposed standardized baseline. In case of deviation from the approach referred to\n         in paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above, the proponent shall also justify why a revision of the\n         approved methodology or methodological tool is not necessary.\n13.      If the proponent wishes to use a new or revised approach to be contained in a\n         methodology or methodological tool in accordance with paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above,\n         or if there is no approved methodology available to be used together with the proposed\n         standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions, it shall, through the DNA of the\n         Party for which the standardized baseline is proposed, request approval from the\n         Supervisory Body of a new or revised methodology or methodological tool in accordance\n         with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring\n         methodologies and methodological tools”, through one of the following processes:\n         (a)     Propose a new or revised methodology or methodological tool through the bottom-\n                 up process. 7 In this case, this proposal of a new or revised methodology or\n                 methodological tool shall be referred to in the submission of the proposed\n                 standardized baseline; or\n         (b)     Request the secretariat to propose to the Supervisory Body the top-down\n                 development of a new methodology or methodological tool or the top-down revision\n                 of an approved methodology or methodological tool. In this case, this request shall\n                 be referred to in the submission of the proposed standardized baseline.\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification, when proposing\n    a new standardized baseline.\n5\n    An alternative length of the validity of a standardized baseline compared to the default validity of three\n    years may be proposed in accordance with the “Standard: Determining coverage of data and validity of\n    standardized baselines”.\n6\n    The following are examples of specific issues of the sector or geographical area: (i) the data available\n    for the development of a proposed standardized baseline have a different vintage than that required by\n    the approved approach(es); (ii) the default values of baseline and additionality threshold per the\n    “Guideline for establishment of sector specific standardized baselines” are not applicable in their sector-\n    specific context and therefore a different value(s) of the threshold is justified.\n7\n    The proposed new or revised methodology or methodological tool for the purpose of developing a\n    proposed standardized baseline, or the proposed new or revised methodology or methodological tool\n    that will be used together with the proposed standardized baseline, may be submitted to the secretariat\n    at the same time with the proposed standardized baseline in accordance with the “Procedure:\n    development, revision and clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological\n    tools”.\n\n\n\n                                                    5 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n14.      The DNA submitting the proposed standardized baseline shall submit the following\n         documentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the\n         United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website:\n         (a)     The completed “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission”;\n         (b)     A spreadsheet8 containing all data used and the calculations performed for the\n                 establishment of the standardized baseline;\n         (c)     A quality control report prepared in accordance with the “Guideline: Quality\n                 assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized\n                 baselines”;\n         (d)     An assessment report prepared in accordance with paragraphs 15, 16 and 17\n                 below;\n         (e)     All additional documentation supporting the submission (e.g. statistics and/or,\n                 studies etc.), where applicable;\n         (f)     Letter of approval on the proposed standardized baseline from the DNA.\n15.      In cases where no data collection/processing is required to establish the proposed\n         standardized baseline:9\n\n         (a)     The documentation referred to in paragraphs 14(b)−14(c) above are not required\n                 to be submitted;\n         (a)     The assessment report, referred to in paragraph 14(d) above, does not need to\n                 cover the quality assurance and quality control system referred to in paragraph\n                 17(a) below. Consequently, the assessment report only needs to include an\n                 assessment of the compliance of the proposed standardized baseline with one of\n                 the approaches referred to in 17(b) below.\n16.      The assessment report referred to in paragraph 14(d) above may be prepared by a\n         designated operational entity (DOE) contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other\n         entity under the agreement with the DNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be\n         prepared by a DOE with funding support in accordance with the modalities described in\n         appendix 1 of this procedure.\n17.      The assessment report shall include a positive assessment opinion:\n         (a)     On the compliance of the quality assurance and quality control system with the\n                 provisions and data quality objectives of the “Guideline: Quality assurance and\n                 quality control of data in the establishment of standardized baselines”;\n         (b)     That the proposed standardized baseline meets the requirements of:\n                 (i)    One of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10 above;\n\n8\n    In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format.\n9\n    Such cases are standardized baselines developed based only on existence of or lack of a\n    policy/regulation. For example, since a standardized baseline for landfill gas destruction developed in\n    accordance with the “Standard: Establishment of sector specific standardized baselines” requires\n    information only on regulations on the mandatory destruction level, no data collection/processing is\n    required.\n\n\n\n                                                   6 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n                 (ii)    A proposed combination of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10\n                         above; or\n                 (iii)   One of the approaches referred to in paragraph 10 above with a proposed\n                         deviation from the approach.10\n18.       No fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed standardized\n          baseline.\n\n5.2.2. Initial assessment\n19.       The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:\n          Proposed standardized baseline initial assessment” within 21 days of receipt of the\n          submission to determine whether:\n          (a)    The DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 14, 15\n                 and 16;\n          (b)    The “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission” has been completed,\n                 including the name and contact details of the proponent;\n          (c)    The proposed standardized baseline was derived from one of the approaches\n                 referred to in paragraph 10 above;\n          (d)    Except for the cases where an assessment report is not submitted in accordance\n                 with paragraph 16, the assessment report includes the positive assessment\n                 opinion in accordance with paragraph 17 above.\n20.       The secretariat shall inform the DNA and the proponent of the outcome of the initial\n          assessment. If the secretariat finds that the required documentation or information is\n          incomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA\n          should provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification.\n21.       The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of the receipt of\n          missing documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion\n          of the initial assessment. If the DNA does not provide the missing documents or\n          information within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission\n          and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized baseline to\n          continue to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as\n          soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if the DNA does\n          not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the initial notification,\n          the submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n22.       Upon successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall assign a\n          reference number to the proposed standardized baseline and make the submitted\n          documentation publicly available on the UNFCCC website with the exception of\n          information declared confidential and/or proprietary by the DNA. Aggregated data and\n          information used to derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential\n          or proprietary.\n\n\n\n\n10\n     If the DOE assesses a proposed standardized baseline with a proposed deviation from an approved\n     approach(es), the assessment of the proposed deviation is not required.\n\n\n\n                                                 7 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n5.2.3. Preparation of a draft recommendation\n23.       Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall\n          prepare a draft recommendation on the proposed standardized baseline using either:\n          (a)      The “Form: Proposed standardized baseline recommendation” for the\n                   recommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 24(a) or 24(c) below; or\n          (b)      The “Form: Proposed standardized baseline submission” for the recommended\n                   course of action referred to in paragraph 24(b) below.\n24.       The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of\n          action:\n          (a)      Approve the proposed standardized baseline;\n          (b)      Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted\n                   documentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or\n          (c)      Not approve the proposed standardized baseline.\n25.       In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n          depending on the technical complexity of the proposed standardized baseline and the\n          availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts\n          from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable and\n          available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the\n          roster.\n26.       The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel 11 and\n          forward its draft recommendation to them.\n27.       In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the\n          Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group, which is\n          comprised of sectoral experts on the roster. For the purpose of this consultation, the roster\n          of methodological experts may be grouped into several working groups (e.g. working\n          group for renewable energy, working group for transport, working group for waste).\n\n5.2.4. Consideration by selected members from the Methodological Expert Panel\n28.       The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of\n          receipt of the draft recommendation, independently assess the proposed standardized\n          baseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the outcome of their\n          assessment.\n29.       If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft\n          recommendation to approve or not to approve the proposed standardized baseline, the\n          secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it\n          publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n11\n     The names, as well as current and past professional affiliations, of the members of the Methodological\n     Expert Panel will be published on the UNFCCC website. Additionally, the terms of reference for the\n     support structure of the Supervisory Body will elaborate on the principles and rules that apply to the\n     Methodological Expert Panel, including provisions related to the code of conduct and conflict of interest.\n     These terms of reference will be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n                                                     8 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n30.    If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft\n       recommendation that the proposed standardized baseline requires further input from the\n       DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using the “Form:\n       Proposed standardized baseline submission”. The DNA should submit the requested input\n       within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the “Form: Proposed\n       standardized baseline submission”. If the DNA submits input including new data, the DNA\n       should submit a revised assessment report, as applicable, within the same deadline. If the\n       DNA does not provide the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable,\n       within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission and ascertain\n       from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized baseline continue to be\n       considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as soon as it receives\n       the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable. In any case, if the\n       DNA does not provide the requested input and a revised assessment report, as applicable,\n       within one year of the initial notification, the submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n31.    The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed standardized baseline be\n       approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the\n       DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues.\n32.    The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input\n       and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend\n       that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The\n       secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the two selected members\n       of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration. In this case, the steps in\n       paragraphs 29 above or 33−37 below shall follow.\n\n5.2.5. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel\n33.    If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the\n       draft recommendation or requests that it be considered by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed standardized\n       baseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is received at least\n       14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one.\n34.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration within two meetings,\n       unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is\n       required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is\n       sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration at the meeting\n       immediately following the receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration,\n       the Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed\n       standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The secretariat shall forward\n       it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly available on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n35.    If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the\n       secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA\n       should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not\n       submit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing\n       the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed\n       standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume\n       processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the\n\n\n\n                                                9 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the\n       submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n36.    The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed standardized\n       baseline be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication\n       with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues.\n37.    The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input\n       and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend\n       that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The\n       secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to\n       recommend that the proposed standardized baseline be either approved or not approved.\n       The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make\n       it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n5.2.6. Preparation of draft standardized baseline\n38.    If the recommendation is to approve the proposed standardized baseline, before\n       forwarding it to the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraphs 29, 34 or 37 above,\n       the secretariat shall:\n       (a)     Reformat the proposed standardized baseline into the form of draft standardized\n               baseline (DSB) and send it to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel\n               members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the draft\n               recommendation last. Upon receipt of an agreement on the DSB from the two\n               selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological\n               Expert Panel, as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the DSB to the DNA\n               and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or request\n               modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by this\n               deadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be\n               delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the DSB and/or requests\n               modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the DSB and the\n               response from the DNA to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members,\n               or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the draft\n               recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the response from the DNA,\n               the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall finalize the DSB\n               within seven days of receipt, or the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the\n               DSB at its next meeting;\n       (b)     Ensure that the proposed new or revised approach(es) to develop the proposed\n               standardized baseline and/or the proposed new or revised methodology to be used\n               together with the proposed standardized baseline to estimate emission reductions\n               have been approved by the Supervisory Body, if they have been submitted to the\n               secretariat in accordance with paragraph 13 above;\n\n5.2.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n39.    If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation received in\n       accordance with paragraphs 29, 34 or 37 above within 28 days of receipt of the\n       recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision\n       adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n40.    An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n41.    If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days\n       prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n42.    If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the\n       following courses of action at the meeting:\n       (a)     Approve the DSB;\n       (b)     Not approve the DSB;\n       (c)     Continue the consideration of the DSB at the next Supervisory Body meeting; or\n       (d)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation and\n               provide guidance on the issues for the review.\n43.    Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n       DNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory\n       Body, as applicable, and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n44.    If the DSB is not approved, the DNA may at any time resubmit a proposed standardized\n       baseline with revised documentation. Upon submission of the revised documentation, the\n       submission shall be treated as a new submission of a proposed standardized baseline.\n\n5.3.   Top-down process\n\n5.3.1. Initiation\n45.    The secretariat may propose to the Supervisory Body that the secretariat develop a DSB\n       at any time following the receipt of an expression of interest from the DNA(s) of a Party(ies)\n       for which the DSB will be proposed. The Supervisory Body shall consider the proposal\n       and decide on one of the following courses of action:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed development of the DSB including, if required during the\n               course of the preparation of the DSB, the top-down development of, revision to, or\n               deviation from:\n               (i)    An approach to develop the DSB; and/or\n               (ii)   A methodology to be used together with the DSB for the purpose of\n                      estimation of emission reductions;\n       (b)     Not approve the proposed development of the DSB; or\n       (c)     Continue the consideration of the proposed development of the DSB at the next\n               Supervisory Body meeting.\n46.    The Supervisory Body may prioritize, as needed, the development or approval of a new\n       standardized baseline, based on factors such as relevance for least developed countries\n       and small island developing States, host country priorities communicated to the\n\n\n\n                                                11 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       Supervisory Body, potential for transformative climate action at a global or regional scale,\n       potential for programmatic approaches, and participation of small and micro businesses.\n\n5.3.2. Preparation of a draft standardized baseline\n47.    If the Supervisory Body decides to develop a DSB in accordance with paragraph 45(a)\n       above, the DNA shall submit the duly completed “Form: Draft standardized baseline\n       development agreement” to the specified UNFCCC e-mail account made available on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n48.    Upon receipt of the duly completed “Form: Draft standardized baseline development\n       agreement”, the secretariat shall prepare a draft development plan of the DSB in\n       consultation with the DNA using the “Form: Draft standardized baseline development\n       plan”, defining, inter alia, the scope, applicability, approach(es), data collection process,\n       data quality assurance process, necessity of a new or revised methodology or\n       methodological tool, necessity of a deviation from the selected approach(es), and time\n       frame for the development of the DSB.\n49.    The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft development plan to them for their review. The selected members shall provide\n       input on the draft development plan within five days of receipt.\n50.    The secretariat shall finalize the development plan, taking into account the input from the\n       selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel within five days of receipt of the\n       input.\n51.    The secretariat shall prepare the DSB in accordance with the development plan. In doing\n       so, the secretariat shall ensure that the DSB complies with the “Standard: Determining\n       coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines”, including the requirements\n       related to the data coverage period, data currentness and the validity of standardized\n       baselines.\n52.    In preparing the DSB, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise, depending on the\n       technical complexity of the DSB and the availability of expertise in the secretariat, by\n       selecting a maximum of two external experts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If\n       the secretariat does not find suitable and available experts on the roster, it may use the\n       services of experts not included on the roster.\n53.    The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the DSB to them.\n54.    In preparing the DSB, the secretariat and the selected members of the Methodological\n       Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in paragraph 27\n       above.\n\n5.3.3. Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel\n55.    The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of\n       receipt of the DSB, independently assess the DSB and inform the secretariat of their\n       recommendation, indicating one of the following courses of action:\n       (a)     Approve the DSB;\n       (b)     Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted\n               documentation) from the DNA; or\n\n\n\n                                                12 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       (c)     Request that the DSB be considered by the Methodological Expert Panel.\n56.    If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the\n       DSB be approved, the secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body and make it\n       publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n57.    If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the\n       DSB requires further input from the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA(s)\n       accordingly. The DNA should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification.\n       If the DNA does not provide the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall\n       suspend processing the development and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that\n       the DSB continue to be developed. The secretariat shall resume developing the DSB as\n       soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the DNA does not provide the\n       requested input within one year of the initial notification, the secretariat shall terminate the\n       development of the DSB.\n58.    The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that it is still not sufficient to develop the DSB, the secretariat may initiate a direct\n       communication with the DNA via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues.\n59.    The secretariat shall revise the DSB, taking into account the further input and direct\n       communication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat shall forward the revised DSB\n       to the two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration.\n       In this case, the steps in paragraphs 56 above or 60−64 below shall follow.\n\n5.3.4. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel\n60.    If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel requests that the DSB\n       be considered by the Methodological Expert Panel, the secretariat shall forward the DSB\n       to the Methodological Expert Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the\n       DSB at its next meeting, provided it is received at least 14 days before the meeting;\n       otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one.\n61.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the DSB within two meetings, unless it finds\n       that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is required. In case\n       further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is sought, the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the DSB at the meeting immediately following\n       receipt of such input or guidance. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body\n       and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n62.    If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the\n       secretariat shall notify the DNA accordingly. In this case, the DNA should submit the\n       requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not submit the requested\n       input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend the development of the DSB and\n       ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the DSB continue to be developed. The\n       secretariat shall resume developing the DSB as soon as it receives the requested input.\n       In any case, if the DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial\n       notification, the secretariat shall terminate the development of the DSB.\n63.    The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA(s). If the secretariat\n       finds that the further input is still not sufficient to develop the DSB, the secretariat may\n       initiate a direct communication with the DNA(s) via e-mail or conference calls to clarify\n       remaining issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                13 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n64.    The secretariat shall revise the DSB, taking into account the further input and direct\n       communication with the DNA(s), as applicable. The secretariat shall forward the revised\n       DSB to the Methodological Expert Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological\n       Expert Panel shall finalize the DSB. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory\n       Body and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n5.3.5. Finalization of a draft standardized baseline\n65.    Before forwarding the DSB to the Supervisory Body in accordance with paragraphs 56, 61\n       or 64 above, the secretariat shall communicate the DSB to the DNA. The DNA shall\n       confirm that it is acceptable or request modifications to it within 14 days of receipt. If the\n       DNA does not respond by this deadline, the forwarding of the DSB to the Supervisory\n       Body may be delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the DSB and/or requests\n       modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the DSB and the response\n       from the DNA to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the\n       Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered the DSB last. In this case, taking into\n       account the response of the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members\n       shall finalize the DSB within seven days of receipt, or the Methodological Expert Panel\n       shall finalize the DSB at its next meeting, as applicable.\n\n5.3.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n66.    If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the DSB received in\n       accordance with paragraphs 56, 61 or 64 above within 28 days of receipt of the DSB, the\n       DSB shall be deemed to be approved by the Supervisory Body.\n67.    An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n68.    If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the DSB more than 14 days\n       prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n69.    If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the\n       following courses of action at the meeting:\n       (a)     Approve the DSB;\n       (b)     Not approve the DSB;\n       (c)     Continue the consideration of the DSB at the next Supervisory Body meeting; or\n       (d)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the DSB and provide guidance\n               on the issues for the review.\n70.    Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n       DNA of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory Body, as applicable,\n       and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n\n                                                14 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n6.        Revision of a standardized baseline\n6.1.      Bottom-up process\n\n6.1.1. Submission of proposed revised standardized baseline\n71.       A proponent may, taking into account the principles for revisions referred to in appendix to\n          this procedure, propose a revision to an approved standardized baseline through the DNA\n          of a Party for which the revised standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, if new or\n          additional data were used to establish the proposed revised standardized baseline, the\n          proponent shall ensure that the new or additional data used in the proposed revised\n          standardized baseline complies12 with the “Standard: Determining coverage of data and\n          validity of standardized baselines,” including the requirements related to the data coverage\n          period and data currentness. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed revised\n          standardized baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs 72‒74 below.\n72.       The DNA submitting the proposed revised standardized baseline shall submit the following\n          documentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the\n          UNFCCC website:\n          (a)     The completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”;\n          (b)     The proposed revised standardized baseline, highlighting the proposed changes\n                  to the approved standardized baseline;\n          (c)     A spreadsheet13 containing all data used and the calculations performed for the\n                  establishment of the proposed revised standardized baseline;\n          (d)     A quality control report prepared in accordance with the “Guideline: Quality\n                  assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized\n                  baselines”;\n          (e)     An assessment report on the proposed revised standardized baseline containing\n                  the information referred to in paragraph 17 above and prepared in accordance with\n                  paragraph 73(b) below;\n          (f)     All additional documentation supporting the submission (e.g. statistics and/or,\n                  studies etc.), where applicable;\n          (g)     Letter of approval on the proposed revised standardized baseline from the DNA.\n73.       In cases where no new or additional data were required to establish the proposed revised\n          standardized baseline:\n          (a)     The documentation referred to in paragraph 72(d) above is not required to be\n                  submitted;\n          (b)     The assessment report referred to in paragraph 72(e) above does not need to\n                  include a positive assessment opinion on the compliance of the quality assurance\n                  and quality control system referred to in paragraph 17(a) above. Consequently, the\n\n12\n     Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification when proposing\n     a revision to an approved standardized baseline.\n13\n     In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format.\n\n\n\n                                                    15 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n               assessment report only needs to include a positive assessment opinion that the\n               proposed standardized baseline meet the requirements of one of the approaches\n               referred to in paragraph 17(b) above.\n74.    The assessment report referred to in paragraph 72(e) above may be prepared by a DOE\n       contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other entity under the agreement with\n       the DNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be prepared by a DOE with funding\n       support in accordance with the modalities described in appendix 1 to this procedure.\n75.    No fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline.\n\n6.1.2. Initial assessment\n76.    The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:\n       Approved standardized baseline revision request initial assessment” within 21 days of\n       receipt of the submission to determine whether:\n       (a)     The DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 72 and\n               73 above;\n       (b)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”, has been duly\n               completed, including the name and contact details of the proponent;\n       (c)     The proposed revised standardized baseline was derived from the same approach\n               as the one used in the approved standardized baseline that is being proposed for\n               revision;\n       (d)     The assessment report includes a positive assessment opinion in accordance with\n               paragraph 17 above.\n77.    The secretariat shall inform the DNA and the proponent of the outcome of the initial\n       assessment. If the secretariat finds that the required documentation or information is\n       incomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA\n       should provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification.\n78.    The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of receipt of the\n       missing documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion\n       of the initial assessment. If the DNA does not provide the missing documents or\n       information within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission\n       and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised standardized\n       baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the\n       submission as soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if\n       the DNA does not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the\n       initial notification, the submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n79.    Upon successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall assign a\n       reference number to the proposed revision and make the submitted documentation\n       publicly available on the UNFCCC website with the exception of information declared\n       confidential and/or proprietary by the DNA. Aggregated data and information used to\n       derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential or proprietary.\n\n\n\n\n                                                16 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n6.1.3. Preparation of a draft recommendation\n80.      Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall\n         prepare a draft recommendation on the proposed revised standardized baseline using\n         either:\n         (a)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision recommendation” for the\n                 recommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 82(a) or 81(c) below; or\n         (b)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”                for   the\n                 recommended course of action referred to in paragraph 81(b) below.\n81.      The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of\n         action:\n         (a)     Approve the proposed revised standardized baseline, indicating that:\n                 (i)    The revision is a major revision; or\n                 (ii)   The revision is a minor revision;\n         (b)     Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted\n                 documentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or\n         (c)     Not approve the proposed revised standardized baseline.\n82.      In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n         depending on the technical complexity of the proposed revised standardized baseline and\n         the availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external\n         experts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable\n         and available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the\n         roster.\n83.      The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n         its draft recommendation to them.\n84.      In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the\n         Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in\n         paragraph 27 above.\n\n6.1.4. Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel\n85.      The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of\n         receipt of the draft recommendation, independently assess the proposed revised\n         standardized baseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the\n         outcome of their assessment.\n86.      If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft\n         recommendation that the proposed revised standardized baseline be approved indicating\n         that the revision is major, 14 approved indicating that the revision is minor, 15 or not\n         approved, the secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n         and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n14\n     See paragraph 181.\n15\n     See paragraph 184.\n\n\n\n                                                 17 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n87.    If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft\n       recommendation that the proposed revised standardized baseline requires further input\n       from the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using\n       the “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request”. The DNA should submit the\n       requested input within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the\n       “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision request form”. If the DNA does not\n       provide the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing\n       the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume\n       processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the\n       DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the\n       submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n88.    The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed revised standardized baseline\n       be approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or not approved, the secretariat\n       may initiate a direct communication with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or\n       conference calls to clarify remaining issues.\n89.    The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input\n       and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend\n       that the proposed revised standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the\n       revision is major or minor, or not approved. The secretariat shall forward the revised draft\n       recommendation to the two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel for their\n       consideration. In this case, the steps in paragraphs 86 above or 90−93 below shall follow.\n\n6.1.5. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel\n90.    If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the\n       draft recommendation or requests that it be considered by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed revised standardized\n       baseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is received at least\n       14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the meeting after that one.\n91.    The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration within two meetings,\n       unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is\n       required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is\n       sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration at the meeting\n       immediately following receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or\n       not approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory\n       Body and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n92.    If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the\n       secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA\n       should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not\n       submit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing\n       the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume\n       processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the\n\n\n\n\n                                                18 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the\n       submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n93.    The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline be approved indicating that the revision is major or minor, or not\n       approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA and the\n       proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues.\n94.    The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input\n       and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend\n       that the proposed revised standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the\n       revision is major or minor, or not approved. The secretariat shall forward the revised draft\n       recommendation to the Methodological Expert Panel for its final consideration. The\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline be either approved indicating that the revision is major or minor or\n       not approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory\n       Body and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.1.6. Preparation of draft revised standardized baseline\n95.    If the draft recommendation is to approve the proposed revised standardized baseline in\n       accordance with paragraphs 86, 91 or 94 above, the secretariat shall, before forwarding it\n       as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body, reformat the proposed revised\n       standardized baseline and send it to the two selected Methodological Expert Panel\n       members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered it last. Upon\n       receipt of an agreement on the reformatted revised standardized baseline from the two\n       selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological Expert Panel,\n       as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the reformatted revised standardized\n       baseline to the DNA and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or\n       request modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by\n       this deadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be\n       delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the reformatted revised standardized\n       baseline and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the\n       reformatted revised standardized baseline and the response from the DNA to the two\n       selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel,\n       whichever considered the draft recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the\n       response from the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall\n       finalize the reformatted revised standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the reformatted revised standardized baseline\n       at its next meeting, as applicable.\n\n6.1.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n96.    If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation received in\n       accordance with paragraphs 86, 91 or 94 above within 28 days of receipt of the\n       recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision\n       adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n97.    An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n                                                19 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n98.    If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days\n       prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n99.    If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the\n       following courses of action at the meeting:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed revised standardized baseline, indicating that:\n               (i)    The revision is a major revision; or\n               (ii)   The revision is a minor revision;\n       (b)     Not approve the proposed revised standardized baseline;\n       (c)     Continue the consideration of the proposed revised standardized baseline at the\n               next Supervisory Body meeting; or\n       (d)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation and\n               provide guidance on the issues for the review.\n100.   Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n       DNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory\n       Body, as applicable, and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n101.   If the proposed revised standardized baseline is not approved, the DNA may at any time\n       resubmit a proposed revised standardized baseline with revised documentation. Upon\n       submission of the revised documentation, the submission shall be treated as a new\n       submission of a proposed revised standardized baseline.\n\n6.2.   Top-down process\n\n6.2.1. Initiation\n102.   The Supervisory Body may, taking into account the principles for revisions referred to in\n       appendix to this procedure, decide to revise an approved standardized baseline at any\n       time. If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved standardized baseline, the\n       Supervisory Body shall also decide to:\n       (a)     Put on hold the approved standardized baseline with immediate effect. In this case,\n               DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC website,\n               any project design document (PDD) or programme of activities design document\n               (PoA-DD) for global stakeholder consultation, any request for registration or any\n               request for renewal of the crediting period of a project or PoA applying the\n               approved standardized baseline from the day following the date of publication of\n               the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the decision;\n       (b)     Put on hold the approved standardized baseline with a grace period of 28 days. In\n               this case, DOEs shall not submit, through a dedicated interface on the UNFCCC\n               website, any PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, any request for\n               registration or any request for renewal of the crediting period of a project or PoA\n               applying the approved standardized baseline more than 28 days following the date\n               of publication of the Supervisory Body’s meeting report containing the decision; or\n\n\n\n                                                20 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       (c)     Maintain the current version of the approved standardized baseline until the expiry\n               of its validity in accordance with section 9 below.\n103.   The Methodological Expert Panel or the secretariat may at any time, taking into account\n       the principles for revisions referred to in appendix to this procedure, propose that the\n       Supervisory Body revise an approved standardized baseline. If the Methodological Expert\n       Panel or the secretariat considers that the current version of the approved standardized\n       baseline should be put on hold, it shall recommend so to the Supervisory Body. In these\n       cases, the Supervisory Body shall consider the proposal and/or the recommendation and\n       decide whether to revise and/or to put on hold the current version of the approved\n       standardized baseline in accordance with paragraph 102 above.\n\n6.2.2. Preparation of a draft revised standardized baseline\n104.   If the Supervisory Body decides to revise an approved standardized baseline in\n       accordance with paragraphs 102 or 103 above, the secretariat shall communicate the\n       decision to the DNA of the Party for which a revised standardized baseline will be\n       proposed and seek its agreement to the initiation of the revision. Following receipt of the\n       agreement with the DNA using the “Form: Approved standardized baseline revision\n       agreement”, the secretariat shall prepare a draft revised standardized baseline\n       highlighting the proposed changes to the approved standardized baseline.\n105.   In preparing the draft revised standardized baseline, the secretariat may draw upon\n       external expertise, depending on the technical complexity of the revision and the\n       availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts\n       from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable and\n       available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the\n       roster.\n106.   The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft revised standardized baseline to them.\n107.   In preparing the draft revised standardized baselines, the secretariat and the selected\n       members of the Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group\n       referred to in paragraph 27 above.\n\n6.2.3. Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel\n108.   The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of\n       receipt of the draft revised standardized baseline, independently assess the draft revised\n       standardized baseline and inform the secretariat of their recommendation indicating one\n       of the following courses of action:\n       (a)     Approve the draft revised standardized baseline, indicating that:\n               (i)    The revision is a major revision; or\n               (ii)   The revision is a minor revision;\n       (b)     Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted\n               documentation) from the DNA; or\n       (c)     Request that the draft revised standardized baseline be considered by the\n               Methodological Expert Panel.\n\n\n\n\n                                                21 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n109.   If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the\n       draft revised standardized baseline be approved indicating that the revision is either major\n       or minor, the secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly\n       available on the UNFCCC website.\n110.   If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel recommend that the\n       draft revised standardized baseline requires further input from the DNA, the secretariat\n       shall notify the DNA accordingly. The DNA should submit the requested input within\n       28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not provide the requested input within the\n       deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the development and ascertain from\n       the DNA whether it wishes that the draft revised standardized baseline continue to be\n       developed. The secretariat shall resume development of the draft revised standardized\n       baseline as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the DNA does not\n       provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the secretariat shall\n       terminate the development of the draft revised standardized baseline.\n111.   The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that it is still not sufficient to develop the draft revised standardized baseline, the\n       secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA via e-mail or conference calls\n       to clarify remaining issues.\n112.   The secretariat shall revise the draft revised standardized baseline, taking into account\n       the further input and direct communication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat\n       shall forward the revised draft revised standardized baseline to the two selected members\n       of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration. In this case, the steps in\n       paragraphs 109 above or 113−117 below shall follow.\n\n6.2.4. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel\n113.   If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel requests that the draft\n       revised standardized baseline be considered by the Methodological Expert Panel, the\n       secretariat shall forward the draft revised standardized baseline to the Methodological\n       Expert Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the draft revised\n       standardized baseline at its next meeting, provided it is received at least 14 days before\n       the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the Supervisory Body meeting after that\n       one.\n114.   The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft revised standardized baseline\n       within two meetings, unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the\n       Supervisory Body is required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the\n       Supervisory Body is sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft\n       revised standardized baseline at the meeting immediately following receipt of such input\n       or guidance. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly\n       available on the UNFCCC website.\n115.   If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the\n       secretariat shall notify the DNA accordingly. In this case, the DNA should submit the\n       requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not submit the requested\n       input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend the development of the draft\n       revised standardized baseline and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the draft\n       revised standardized baseline continue to be developed. The secretariat shall resume\n       development of the draft revised standardized baseline as soon as it receives the\n       requested input. In any case, if the DNA does not provide the requested input within one\n\n\n\n                                                22 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       year of the initial notification, the secretariat shall terminate the development of the draft\n       revised standardized baseline.\n116.   The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that the further input is still not sufficient to develop the draft revised standardized baseline,\n       the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the DNA via e-mail or conference\n       calls to clarify remaining issues.\n117.   The secretariat shall revise the draft revised standardized baseline, taking into account\n       the further input and direct communication with the DNA, as applicable. The secretariat\n       shall forward the revised draft revised standardized baseline to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft\n       revised standardized baseline. The secretariat shall forward it to the Supervisory Body\n       and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.2.5. Finalization of draft revised standardized baseline\n118.   Before forwarding the draft revised standardized baseline in accordance with\n       paragraphs 109, 114 or 117 above, the secretariat shall communicate the draft revised\n       standardized baseline to the DNA. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or request\n       modifications to it within 14 days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by this deadline,\n       the forwarding of the draft revised standardized baseline to the Supervisory Body may be\n       delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the draft revised standardized baseline\n       and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the draft\n       revised standardized baseline and the response from the DNA to the two selected\n       Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever\n       considered the draft revised standardized baseline last. In this case, taking into account\n       the response of the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall\n       finalize the draft revised standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the draft revised standardized baseline at its\n       next meeting, as applicable.\n\n6.2.6. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n119.   If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the draft revised standardized\n       baseline received in accordance with paragraphs 109, 114 or 117 above within 28 days of\n       receipt of the draft revised standardized baseline, the draft revised standardized baseline\n       shall be deemed to be approved by the Supervisory Body.\n120.   An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n121.   If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to approving the draft revised standardized\n       baseline more than 14 days prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be\n       placed on the agenda of the next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed\n       on the agenda of the Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n122.   If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the\n       following courses of action at the meeting:\n       (a)     Approve the draft revised standardized baseline, indicating that:\n               (i)    The revision is a major revision; or\n\n\n\n                                                23 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n               (ii)   The revision is a minor revision;\n       (b)     Not approve the draft revised standardized baseline;\n       (c)     Continue the consideration of the draft revised standardized baseline at the next\n               Supervisory Body meeting; or\n       (d)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the draft revised standardized\n               baseline and provide guidance on the issues for the review.\n123.   Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n       DNA(s) of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory Body, as applicable,\n       and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n6.2.7. Other\n124.   The secretariat may propose an editorial revision to an approved standardized baseline at\n       any time. In this case, the secretariat shall submit a draft revised standardized baseline to\n       the Chair of the Supervisory Body for his/her review. If the Chair agrees to the draft revised\n       standardized baseline, the secretariat shall publish the revised standardized baseline on\n       the UNFCCC website. The editorial revision shall be noted in the report of the next meeting\n       of the Supervisory Body.\n\n7.     Clarification of a standardized baseline\n7.1.   Bottom-up process\n\n7.1.1. Submission of request for clarification\n125.   The activity participants of a planned project or PoA, the coordinating/managing entity of\n       a planned PoA, a DOE, a DNA or any other stakeholder (hereinafter in section 7.1 referred\n       to as the enquirer) may, taking into account the principles for clarifications referred to in\n       appendix to this procedure, request clarification of an approved standardized baseline by\n       submitting the completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline clarification request” to\n       the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made available on the UNFCCC\n       website.\n\n7.1.2. Initial assessment\n126.   The secretariat shall give notice of the receipt of the request for clarification to the DNA of\n       a Party to which the approved standardized baseline applies within seven days of receipt.\n127.   The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:\n       Approved standardized baseline clarification request initial assessment” within 21 days of\n       receipt of the submission, to determine whether:\n       (a)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline clarification request”, including the\n               name and contact details of the enquirer, has been duly completed; and\n       (b)     The submission is categorized as either:\n               (i)    Involving no regulatory and/or technical ambiguity or only simple regulatory\n                      and/or technical issues, hence requiring no analysis or only a simple analysis\n                      to formulate a clarification; or\n\n\n\n\n                                                24 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n               (ii)   Involving complex regulatory and/or technical issues and/or having the\n                      potential to apply to multiple versions of the approved standardized baseline,\n                      hence requiring a thorough analysis to formulate a clarification.\n128.   If the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall request the enquirer to\n       submit the missing or revised documents and/or information. In this case, the enquirer\n       shall submit the requested documents and/or information to the secretariat within five days\n       of the receipt of the request. If the enquirer does not submit the requested documents\n       and/or information by this deadline, the secretariat shall conclude that the submission is\n       incomplete.\n129.   Upon conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall notify the enquirer of the\n       conclusion of the initial assessment. If the submission is concluded as incomplete in\n       accordance with paragraph 128 above, the secretariat shall communicate the underlying\n       reasons to the enquirer. In this case, the enquirer may resubmit the request for clarification\n       with revised documentation at any time. Upon submission, the revised documentation\n       shall be treated as a new submission of a request for clarification under this procedure.\n\n7.1.3. Fast track\n130.   If the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 127(i) above,\n       the secretariat shall prepare a clarification using the “Form: Approved standardized\n       baseline clarification response” and send it to the enquirer and the DNA within nine days\n       of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment.\n131.   In preparing the clarification, the secretariat may consult with the Methodological Expert\n       Panel. In this case, the timeline referred to in paragraph 130 above shall not apply. The\n       secretariat shall send a draft clarification to the Methodological Expert Panel within nine\n       days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment. If no member of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel objects to the draft clarification within seven days of receipt\n       of the draft clarification, the clarification shall be deemed finalized by the Methodological\n       Expert Panel. If a member of the Methodological Expert Panel objects to the draft\n       clarification, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel. At the meeting where the case is placed on the agenda, the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to finalize the clarification within one\n       meeting.\n132.   The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website.\n\n7.1.4. Regular track\n133.   If the submission is determined as being the case referred to in paragraph 127(ii) above,\n       the secretariat shall prepare a draft recommendation of a clarification to the\n       Methodological Expert Panel using the “Form: Approved standardized baseline\n       clarification response”.\n134.   In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n       depending on the technical complexity of the issues in question and the availability of\n       expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external experts from the\n       Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable and available\n       experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the roster.\n\n\n\n\n                                                25 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n135.   The secretariat shall select one member of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       the draft recommendation to him/her for review. The selected member shall provide input\n       on the draft recommendation within three days of receipt.\n136.   In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat and the selected members of the\n       Methodological Expert Panel may consult with the relevant working group referred to in\n       paragraph 27 above.\n137.   The secretariat may also forward the draft recommendation to the DNA for review. In this\n       case, the DNA shall provide input on the draft recommendation within seven days of\n       receipt.\n138.   The secretariat shall finalize the recommendation, taking into account the input from the\n       selected member and the DNA, as applicable, and submit it to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel for consideration.\n139.   The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the recommendation, finalize the\n       recommendation and forward it to the Supervisory Body and publish it in its corresponding\n       meeting report, indicating the version(s) of the approved standardized baseline to which\n       the clarification applies. The Methodological Expert Panel shall make every effort to\n       finalize the recommendation within one meeting.\n140.   If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation above within 28\n       days of receipt of the recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be\n       deemed to be the decision adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n141.   An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n142.   If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days\n       prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n143.   At the Supervisory Body meeting for which the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       is placed on the agenda, the Supervisory Body shall decide to either:\n       (a)     Approve the recommended clarification; or\n       (b)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation to the\n               Supervisory Body and provide guidance on the issues for review.\n144.   If the Supervisory Body approves the clarification, the secretariat shall send the finalized\n       clarification to the enquirer and the DNA.\n145.   The secretariat shall publish the clarification on the UNFCCC website.\n\n7.1.5. Other\n146.   At any step before the clarification is finalized in accordance with paragraphs 130, 131 or\n       (a) above, the secretariat may request the enquirer to provide additional information\n       regarding the request for clarification within a defined time frame to facilitate the\n       assessment by the secretariat and/or the consideration by the Methodological Expert\n\n\n\n\n                                                26 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n          Panel. If such information significantly affects the outcome of the consideration, the\n          secretariat shall make the information publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n7.2.      Top-down process\n147.      If the Supervisory Body, the Methodological Expert Panel, or the secretariat finds it\n          necessary, taking into account the principles for clarifications referred to in appendix to\n          this procedure, to clarify provisions of an approved standardized baseline, the process to\n          revise the approved standardized baseline as defined in section 6.2 shall be followed. In\n          this case, the draft revised standardized baseline shall incorporate all relevant\n          clarifications issued prior to the revision.\n\n8.        Update of a standardized baseline\n8.1.      Bottom-up process\n\n8.1.1. Submission of a proposed updated standardized baseline\n148.      A proponent may propose an updated standardized baseline through the DNA of the Party\n          for which the updated standardized baseline is proposed. In doing so, the proponent shall\n          ensure that the proposed updated standardized baseline complies16 with the “Standard:\n          Determining coverage of data and validity of standardized baselines”, including the\n          requirements related to the data coverage period, data currentness and the validity of\n          standardized baselines. The DNA should subsequently submit the proposed updated\n          standardized baseline to the secretariat in accordance with paragraphs149‒151 below.\n149.      The DNA submitting the proposed updated standardized baseline shall submit the\n          following documentation to the secretariat through a specified e-mail account made\n          available on the UNFCCC website between 270 to 180 days prior to the date when the\n          validity of the current standardized baseline expires:17\n          (a)     The completed “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”;\n          (b)     The proposed updated standardized baseline, highlighting the proposed changes\n                  to the approved standardized baseline;\n          (c)     A spreadsheet 18 containing all data used and the calculations performed for the\n                  establishment of the proposed updated standardized baseline;\n          (d)     A quality control report prepared in accordance with the “Guideline: Quality\n                  assurance and quality control of data used in the establishment of standardized\n                  baselines”;\n          (e)     An assessment report on the proposed updated standardized baseline containing\n                  the information referred to in paragraph 17 above and prepared in accordance with\n                  paragraph 150 below.\n\n16\n     Deviations from the requirements in the standard may be proposed with due justification when proposing\n     an update of an approved standardized baseline.\n17\n     Any delay in the submission from this time frame may create a gap period between the expiry of the\n     current standardized baseline and the entry-into-force of the updated standardized baseline. For the\n     requirement for addressing such gap period, see section 9 below.\n18\n     In an accessible and verifiable (unprotected) format.\n\n\n\n                                                    27 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       (a)     All additional documentation supporting the submission (e.g. statistics and/or,\n               studies etc.), where applicable;\n       (b)     Letter of approval on the proposed updated standardized baseline from the DNA.\n150.   In cases where no new or additional data were required to establish the proposed updated\n       standardized baseline:\n       (a)     The documentation referred to in paragraph (d) above is not required to be\n               submitted;\n       (b)     The assessment report referred to in paragraph 1(e) above does not need to\n               include a positive assessment opinion on the compliance of the quality assurance\n               and quality control system referred to in paragraph 17(a) above. Consequently, the\n               assessment report only needs to include a positive assessment opinion that the\n               proposed standardized baseline meets the requirements of one of the approaches\n               referred to in paragraph 17(b) above.\n151.   The assessment report referred to in paragraph 1(e) above may be prepared by a DOE\n       contracted and paid for by either the DNA or any other entity under agreement with the\n       DNA. Alternatively, an assessment report may be prepared by a DOE with funding support\n       in accordance with the modalities described in appendix 1 to this procedure.\n152.   The secretariat shall make every effort to inform the DNA in advance of the period for\n       requesting update of the approved standardized baseline. It remains the responsibility of\n       the DNA to ensure that all actions are taken in accordance with this section of the\n       procedure in a timely manner.\n153.   The Supervisory Body may, upon request from the DNA, decide to request the secretariat\n       to provide technical support to the DNA for the preparation of the request without prejudice\n       to the outcome of the subsequent request.\n154.   No fee shall be payable to the secretariat for the submission of the proposed updated\n       standardized baseline.\n\n8.1.2. Initial assessment\n155.   The secretariat shall undertake an initial assessment of the submission using the “Form:\n       Approved standardized baseline update request initial assessment” within 21 days of\n       receipt of the submission. The secretariat shall assess whether:\n       (a)     The DNA submitted all the documentation in accordance with paragraphs 149 and\n               150 above;\n       (b)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”, including the name\n               and contact details of the proponent, has been duly completed;\n       (c)     The proposed updated standardized baseline was derived from the same\n               approach as the one used in the approved standardized baseline that is being\n               proposed for an update;\n       (d)     The proposed updated standardized baseline, if developed using the approach\n               referred to in paragraphs 10(a) or 10(b) above, does not require revision to the\n               underlying approved methodology or methodological tool. If it requires such\n               revision, the secretariat shall propose that the Board carry out the revision through\n\n\n\n                                                28 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n               the top-down process in accordance with the “Procedure: development, revision\n               and clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological\n               tools”;\n       (e)     The assessment report includes positive assessment opinion in accordance with\n               paragraph 17 above.\n156.   The secretariat shall inform the DNA and the proponent of the outcome of the initial\n       assessment. If the secretariat finds that the required documentation or information is\n       incomplete, it shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA\n       should provide the missing documents or information within 42 days of the notification.\n157.   The secretariat shall conclude the initial assessment within 14 days of receipt of missing\n       documents or information and inform the DNA and the proponent of the conclusion of the\n       initial assessment. If the DNA does not provide the missing documents or information\n       within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the submission and ascertain\n       from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed updated standardized baseline\n       continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the submission as\n       soon as it receives the missing documents or information. In any case, if the DNA does\n       not provide the missing documents or information within one year of the initial notification,\n       the submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n158.   Upon successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall assign a\n       reference number to the proposed updated standardized baseline and make the submitted\n       documentation publicly available on the UNFCCC website with the exception of\n       information declared confidential and/or proprietary by the DNA. Aggregated data and\n       information used to derive the standardized baseline shall not be considered confidential\n       or proprietary.\n\n8.1.3. Preparation of a draft recommendation\n159.   Within 28 days of the successful conclusion of the initial assessment, the secretariat shall\n       prepare a draft recommendation on the proposed updated standardized baseline using\n       either:\n       (a)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline update recommendation” for the\n               recommended course of action referred to in paragraphs 160(a) or 160(c) below;\n               or\n       (b)     The “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request” for the recommended\n               course of action referred to in paragraph 160(b) below.\n160.   The secretariat shall include in its draft recommendation one of the following courses of\n       action:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed updated standardized baseline;\n       (b)     Request further input (e.g. additional information or modification to the submitted\n               documentation) from the DNA and the proponent; or\n       (c)     Not approve the proposed updated standardized baseline.\n161.   In preparing the draft recommendation, the secretariat may draw upon external expertise,\n       depending on the technical complexity of the proposed updated standardized baseline\n       and the availability of expertise in the secretariat, by selecting a maximum of two external\n\n\n\n                                                29 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       experts from the Methodologies Roster of Experts. If the secretariat does not find suitable\n       and available experts on the roster, it may use the services of experts not included on the\n       roster.\n162.   The secretariat shall select two members of the Methodological Expert Panel and forward\n       its draft recommendation to them.\n\n8.1.4. Consideration by selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel\n163.   The two selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel shall, within seven days of\n       receipt of the draft recommendation, independently assess the proposed updated\n       standardized baseline and the draft recommendation and inform the secretariat of the\n       outcome of their assessment.\n164.   If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft\n       recommendation to approve or not to approve the proposed updated standardized\n       baseline, the secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n165.   If both of the selected members of the Methodological Expert Panel agree to the draft\n       recommendation that the proposed updated standardized baseline requires further input\n       from the DNA, the secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly using\n       the “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”. The DNA should submit the\n       requested input within 28 days of the notification. All the input shall be highlighted in the\n       “Form: Approved standardized baseline update request”. If the DNA does not provide the\n       requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing the\n       submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed standardized\n       baseline continue to be considered. The secretariat shall resume processing the\n       submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the DNA does not\n       provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the submission shall\n       be considered withdrawn.\n166.   The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that it is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed updated standardized baseline\n       be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct communication with the\n       DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify remaining issues.\n167.   The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input\n       and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend\n       that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The\n       secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the two selected members\n       of the Methodological Expert Panel for their consideration. In this case, the steps in\n       paragraphs 164 or 168−172 below shall follow.\n\n8.1.5. Consideration by the Methodological Expert Panel\n168.   If at least one selected member of the Methodological Expert Panel disagrees with the\n       draft recommendation or requests that it be considered by the Methodological Expert\n       Panel, the secretariat shall forward the draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel. The Methodological Expert Panel shall consider the proposed updated\n       standardized baseline and the draft recommendation at its next meeting, provided it is\n       received at least 14 days before the meeting; otherwise it shall be considered at the\n       meeting after that one.\n\n\n\n\n                                                30 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n169.   The Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration within two meetings,\n       unless it finds that further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is\n       required. In case further input from the DNA or guidance from the Supervisory Body is\n       sought, the Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize its consideration at the meeting\n       immediately following receipt of such input or guidance. In finalizing its consideration, the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to recommend that the proposed updated\n       standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The secretariat shall forward\n       it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body and make it publicly available on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n170.   If the Methodological Expert Panel finds that further input from the DNA is required, the\n       secretariat shall notify the DNA and the proponent accordingly. In this case, the DNA\n       should submit the requested input within 28 days of the notification. If the DNA does not\n       submit the requested input within the deadline, the secretariat shall suspend processing\n       the submission and ascertain from the DNA whether it wishes that the proposed\n       standardized baseline continues to be considered. The secretariat shall resume\n       processing the submission as soon as it receives the requested input. In any case, if the\n       DNA does not provide the requested input within one year of the initial notification, the\n       submission shall be considered withdrawn.\n171.   The secretariat shall assess the further input submitted by the DNA. If the secretariat finds\n       that the further input is still not sufficient to recommend that the proposed updated\n       standardized baseline be approved or not approved, the secretariat may initiate a direct\n       communication with the DNA and the proponent via e-mail or conference calls to clarify\n       remaining issues.\n172.   The secretariat shall revise the draft recommendation, taking into account the further input\n       and direct communication with the DNA and the proponent, as applicable, to recommend\n       that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not approved. The\n       secretariat shall forward the revised draft recommendation to the Methodological Expert\n       Panel for its final consideration. The Methodological Expert Panel shall conclude to\n       recommend that the proposed updated standardized baseline be either approved or not\n       approved. The secretariat shall forward it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body\n       and make it publicly available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n8.1.6. Preparation of draft updated standardized baseline\n173.   If the draft recommendation is to approve the proposed updated standardized baseline in\n       accordance with paragraphs 164, 169 or 172 above, the secretariat shall, before\n       forwarding it as the recommendation to the Supervisory Body, reformat the proposed\n       updated standardized baseline and send it to the two selected Methodological Expert\n       Panel members or to the Methodological Expert Panel, whichever considered it last. Upon\n       receipt of an agreement on the reformatted updated standardized baseline from the two\n       selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or from the Methodological Expert Panel,\n       as applicable, the secretariat shall communicate the reformatted updated standardized\n       baseline to the DNA and the proponent. The DNA shall confirm that it is acceptable or\n       request modifications to it within seven days of receipt. If the DNA does not respond by\n       this deadline, the forwarding of the recommendation to the Supervisory Body may be\n       delayed accordingly. If the DNA does not accept the reformatted updated standardized\n       baseline and/or requests modification to it in its response, the secretariat shall forward the\n       reformatted updated standardized baseline and the response from the DNA to the two\n       selected Methodological Expert Panel members, or to the Methodological Expert Panel,\n       whichever considered the draft recommendation last. In this case, taking into account the\n\n\n\n                                                31 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       response from the DNA, the two selected Methodological Expert Panel members shall\n       finalize the reformatted updated standardized baseline within seven days of receipt, or the\n       Methodological Expert Panel shall finalize the reformatted updated standardized baseline\n       at its next meeting, as applicable.\n\n8.1.7. Consideration by the Supervisory Body\n174.   If no member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation received in\n       accordance with paragraphs 164, 169 or 172 above within 28 days of receipt of the\n       recommendation, the recommended course of action shall be deemed to be the decision\n       adopted by the Supervisory Body.\n175.   An objection by a member of the Supervisory Body shall be made by notifying the Chair\n       of the Supervisory Body through the secretariat, giving reasons in writing. The secretariat\n       shall acknowledge receipt of the objection and make it available to the Supervisory Body.\n176.   If a member of the Supervisory Body objects to the recommendation more than 14 days\n       prior to the next Supervisory Body meeting, the case shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       next Supervisory Body meeting; otherwise it shall be placed on the agenda of the\n       Supervisory Body meeting after that one.\n177.   If the Supervisory Body considers the case at its meeting, it shall decide on one of the\n       following courses of action at the meeting:\n       (a)     Approve the proposed updated standardized baseline;\n       (b)     Not approve the proposed updated standardized baseline;\n       (c)     Continue the consideration of the proposed baseline at the next Supervisory Body\n               meeting; or\n       (d)     Request the Methodological Expert Panel to review the recommendation and\n               provide guidance on the issues for the review.\n178.   Once a decision has been made by the Supervisory Body, the secretariat shall inform the\n       DNA and the proponent of the decision and any guidance provided by the Supervisory\n       Body, as applicable, and make the decision and guidance publicly available on the\n       UNFCCC website.\n179.   If the proposed updated standardized baseline is not approved, the DNA may at any time\n       resubmit a proposed updated standardized baseline with revised documentation. Upon\n       submission of the revised documentation, the submission shall be treated as a new\n       submission of a proposed updated standardized baseline.\n\n9.     Validity of new, updated and revised standardized\n       baselines\n180.   The reference number of an approved new standardized baseline shall indicate the year\n       when the standardized baseline comes into force. The approved new or revised\n       standardized baseline shall come into force from the date as indicated in the approved\n       new or revised standardized baseline. From this date, a project or PoA may apply the\n       approved new or revised standardized baseline for the purpose of publishing a PDD or\n       PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a request for registration, or\n       submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA period, in accordance with\n\n\n\n                                                32 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of\n       activities”. The approved new or revised standardized baseline shall be valid for the period\n       indicated in the approved new or revised standardized baseline. The validity period of a\n       standardized baseline does not change due to a revision.\n181.   The year indicated in the reference number of an approved standardized baseline shall\n       be replaced by the year when an updated standardized baseline comes into force if the\n       Supervisory Body approves the updated standardized baseline in accordance with\n       paragraph 177(a) above. The version number of the updated standardized baseline shall\n       also be reset to 01.0 (e.g. from 02.1 to 01.0). The updated standardized baseline shall\n       come into force from the date as indicated in the updated standardized baseline for the\n       purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a\n       request for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA\n       period, in accordance with the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle\n       procedure for programmes of activities”. If, after the publication of a PDD or PoA-DD for\n       global stakeholder consultation, the applied standardized baseline has expired and an\n       updated standardized baseline is available at the time of submission of a request for\n       registration or renewal, the activity participants or the coordinating/managing entity shall\n       revise the PDD or PoA-DD applying the updated standardized baseline. If, after the\n       publication of the PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, the applied\n       standardized baseline has expired and no valid updated standardized baseline is available\n       at the time of submission of a request for registration or renewal, the activity participants\n       or the coordinating/managing entity shall revise the PDD or PoA-DD replacing the\n       standardized baseline with the corresponding parameter values calculated by themselves\n       in accordance with the applied methodology and/or applicable methodological tool. In\n       these cases, the DOE shall not publish the revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder\n       consultation but shall submit it when it submits a request for registration unless otherwise\n       decided by the Supervisory Body when it approves the updated standardized baseline.\n       The updated standardized baseline shall be valid for the period indicated in the approved\n       updated standardized baseline.\n182.   If the entry into force of an updated standardized baseline is not immediately after the\n       expiry of its previous version, thus creating a gap period in the validity of the two\n       consecutive versions of the standardized baseline, the activity participants and the\n       coordinating/managing entities shall, for the purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for\n       global stakeholder consultation, submitting a request for registration, or submitting a\n       request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA period, in accordance with the “Activity\n       cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”,\n       choose one of the following options for calculating baseline emissions for such gap period:\n       (a)     Determine the parameter values in accordance with the applied methodology\n               and/or applicable methodological tool;\n       (b)     Use the more conservative value between the previous and the updated\n               standardized baseline.\n183.   The version number of an approved standardized baseline shall increase by one whole\n       number (e.g. from 01.0 to 02.0) if the Supervisory Body approves a revised standardized\n       baseline indicating that it is a major revision in accordance with paragraphs 99(i) or 122(i)\n       above. In this case, for the purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder\n       consultation, submitting a request for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of\n\n\n\n\n                                                33 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       the crediting period or PoA period in accordance with the “Activity cycle procedure for\n       projects” or “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”:\n       (a)     A project or PoA may still apply the previous version:\n               (i)    Until the 240th day from the date when the revised version becomes effective\n                      unless the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body\n                      in accordance with paragraphs 104(a) or 104(b) above, if the remaining\n                      validity of the standardized baseline for the current period is longer than this\n                      240-day period; or\n               (ii)   Until the validity of the standardized baseline for the current period expires\n                      unless the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body\n                      in accordance with paragraphs 104(a) or 104(b) above, if the remaining\n                      validity of the standardized baseline for the current period is not longer than\n                      this 240-day period; and\n       (b)     A project or PoA shall apply the revised version after this 240-day period, or\n               immediately after its adoption if the previous version has been put on hold in\n               accordance with paragraphs 104(a) or 104(b) above, as applicable, for the purpose\n               of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a\n               request for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period\n               or PoA period in accordance with the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or\n               “Activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”. If a PDD or PoA-DD\n               applying the previous version has already been published for global stakeholder\n               consultation, the activity participants or coordinating/managing entity shall revise\n               the PDD or PoA-DD, applying the revised version. In this case, the DOE shall not\n               publish the revised PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation but submit\n               it when it submits a request for registration unless otherwise decided by the\n               Supervisory Body when it approves the revised standardized baseline.\n184.   The version number of an approved standardized baseline shall increase by one fractional\n       number in the first decimal place (e.g. from 01.0 to 01.1) if the Supervisory Body approves\n       a revised standardized baseline indicating that it is a minor revision in accordance with\n       paragraphs 99(ii) or 122(ii) above, or if an editorial revision to an approved standardized\n       baseline has been made in accordance with paragraph 124 above. In this case, for the\n       purpose of publishing a PDD or PoA-DD for global stakeholder consultation, submitting a\n       request for registration, or submitting a request for renewal of the crediting period or PoA\n       period in accordance with the “Activity cycle procedure for projects” or “Activity cycle\n       procedure for programmes of activities”, a projector PoA may still apply the previous\n       version or any earlier version of minor revision:\n       (a)     Until the 240th day from the date when the next major revision becomes effective\n               unless the previous or earlier version(s) has been put on hold by the Supervisory\n               Body in accordance with paragraphs 104(a) or 104(b) above, if the remaining\n               validity of the standardized baseline for the current period after the next major\n               revision is longer than this 240-day period; or\n       (b)     Until the validity of the standardized baseline for the current period expires unless\n               the previous version has been put on hold by the Supervisory Body in accordance\n               with paragraphs 104(a) or 104(b) above, if the remaining validity of the\n               standardized baseline after the next major revision is not longer than this 240-day\n               period.\n\n\n\n\n                                                34 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. Funding modalities for the preparation of\n            assessment     reports  for   establishing\n            standardized baselines\n\n1.     A designated national authority (DNA) for the the Article 6.4 mechanism may engage a\n       designated operational entity (DOE) to prepare an assessment report using its own\n       resources or with the funding support from the secretariat. The latter is subject to\n       availability of funds.\n2.     The Supervisory Body shall determine the total amount of funding available for such\n       funding support and the period for which the funding is made available. The Board may\n       also determine a ceiling on the fund available for the preparation of each assessment\n       report.\n3.     The secretariat or its contractual partner UN organization (e.g., The United Nations Office\n       for Project Services) will conduct a procurement exercise with eligible and interested\n       DOEs and have a framework contract with the selected DOEs.\n4.     The DNA that wishes to receive support from the secretariat for the preparation of the\n       assessment report may request support by submitting a duly completed “Request for\n       funding for assessment report form” to the secretariat.\n5.     Within 21 days of receipt of the submission from the DNA, the secretariat shall confirm\n       whether the funding is available and whether the submission is complete.\n6.     If the secretariat finds that the submission is incomplete, it shall inform the DNA\n       accordingly and request it to submit any missing documents or information to the\n       secretariat within 10 days.\n7.     If the missing documents or information are not submitted within the deadline referred to\n       in paragraph 6 of this appendix, the secretariat shall suspend processing the request for\n       funding until it receives the missing documents or information.\n8.     Once the submission is considered complete, subject to availability of funds, the\n       secretariat or another UN entity under agreement with the secretariat shall make a\n       contractual arrangement with the DOE.\n9.     The DOE shall prepare an assessment report according to the timeline agreed.\n10.    Once the standardized baseline is submitted and considered complete, the secretariat\n       shall make arrangements through its contractual partner to disburse the funds to the DOE.\n\n\n\n\n                                                35 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2. Principles for the revision and clarification of\n            standardized baselines\n\n1.     Background\n1.     This appendix provides guiding principles for initiating a revision to an approved\n       standardized baseline and for initiating a (request for) clarification of an approved\n       standardized baseline.\n\n2.     Principle for revision\n2.     A revision is the modification of an approved standardized baseline in order to improve it\n       or broaden its scope and applicability.\n3.     A revision of an approved standardized baseline may be initiated if one or more of the\n       following conditions apply:\n       (a)     New or generally accepted scientific evidence indicates that emission reductions\n               or removal enhancements will be overestimated or underestimated based on the\n               approved standardized baseline or that the reductions or enhancements may not\n               be real, measurable and verifiable;\n       (b)     The applicability conditions require broadening to include more potential project\n               activity types or conditions for use;\n       (c)     There are identified inconsistencies, errors and/or ambiguities in the language\n               and/or formulae used within the approved standardized baseline;\n       (d)     Further simplification (e.g. default values) is required to improve the user-\n               friendliness of the approved standardized baseline;\n       (e)     Key issues clarified through a request for clarification of the approved standardized\n               baseline in accordance with section 7 of (the main part of) this procedure are\n               required to be incorporated in the approved standardized baseline;\n       (f)     There are changes to the additionality demonstration, baseline and/or baseline\n               emission factors as determined in the approved standardized baseline.\n\n3.     Principles for clarification\n4.     A clarification on an approved standardized baseline is to clarify:\n       (a)     The applicability of the approved standardized baseline;\n       (b)     Various procedures provided in the approved standardized baseline, inter alia, for\n               identifying the baseline scenario, demonstrating additionality and estimating\n               baseline emission factors; or\n       (c)     Monitoring data and procedures provided in the approved standardized baseline.\n\n\n\n\n                                                36 of 37\nA6.4-PROC-METH-002\nProcedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n5.         A clarification on an approved standardized baseline may be requested if:\n           (a)     Any of the provisions of the approved standardized baseline are unclear or\n                   ambiguous, and there is room for interpretation of the provisions; and/or\n           (b)     Rationale or further background information is needed regarding conditions under\n                   which the approved standardized baseline is to be applied.\n\n                                                     -----\n\n\n                                        Document information\n\n Version         Date                  Description\n\n\n 01.1            6 October 2024        Corrective revision to paragraph 7 of sub-section 2.3, Entry into\n                                       Force.\n 01.0            13 July 2023          SB 006, Annex 5\n                                       Initial adoption.\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Procedure\n Business Function: Methodology\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, standardized baselines, regulatory framework\n\n\n\n\n                                                     37 of 37\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism).1\n2.        The RMPs define general functions of the registry for the Article 6.4 mechanism\n          (hereinafter referred to as the mechanism registry).2 The CMA, at the same session,\n          requested the Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism (SBM) to develop\n          provisions for various processes necessary to operate the Article 6.4 mechanism,\n          including those for the operation of the registry.3\n3.        The CMA, in decision 7/CMA.4, elaborated on the requirements for the mechanism\n          registry, in terms of its form and functions, transaction procedure, and connection with\n          the international registry.4\n4.        The CMA, in decision 6/CMA.6 “Further guidance on the mechanism established by\n          Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”, provided further requirements for the\n          mechanism registry connection with the international registry, Party registries and the\n          availability of the mechanism registry to all Parties. 5 In decision 4/CMA.6, “Matters\n          relating to cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6, paragraph 2, of the Paris\n          Agreement”, the CMA also provided guidance on the authorization of internationally\n          transferred mitigation outcomes6 which impact authorized Article 6.4 emission reductions\n          (AERs) in the mechanism registry.\n\n1.2.      Objective\n5.        The objective of the “Procedure: Article 6.4 registry” (hereinafter referred to as this\n          procedure) is to set out key components and procedural steps and requirements relating\n          to the functioning and the use of the registry.\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3. “Rules, modalities and procedures for the mechanism established by Article 6,\n     paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement.” Annex.

Post-issuance authorization and change of authorization\n60.     Where a Party submits a post-issuance authorization, or a change of authorization in\n        accordance with the activity cycle procedures,34 any invalidity must be resolved before\n        the registry administrator will action the post-issuance authorization in the registry.\n\n6.1.    Post-issuance authorization\n61.     If a Party submits a post-issuance authorization of issued MCUs in accordance with the\n        activity cycle procedures the mechanism registry shall automatically check to confirm that\n        the conditions related to providing a post-issuance authorization of the affected MCUs\n        are satisfied.35\n62.     If it is confirmed that the conditions referred to in paragraph 61 above are satisfied, the\n        mechanism registry administrator shall:\n        (a)     Track and change the authorization status of the affected MCUs to AERs;\n        (b)     Track the MCUs that were forwarded to the SoP account and change them from\n                MCUs to AERs and distinguish them as first transferred in accordance with\n                section 5.3.2 above;\n        (c)     Track the MCUs that were forwarded to the mandatory cancellation for OMGE\n                account and change them from MCUs to AERs and distinguish them as first\n                transferred in accordance with section 5.3.2 above.\n63.     If the mechanism registry’s check (referred to in paragraph 61 above) identifies the\n        conditions related to providing a post-issuance authorization of the affected MCUs are\n        not satisfied, the secretariat shall communicate this to the host Party.\n\n6.2.    Change of authorization\n64.     If a Party submits a change of authorization statement in accordance with activity cycle\n        procedures with respect to issued A6.4ERs, and the affected A6.4ERs are held in the\n        mechanism registry, the mechanism registry administrator shall automatically check to\n        confirm that the conditions related to providing a post-issuance change of authorization\n        of the affected A6.4ERs are satisfied.36\n65.     If it is confirmed that the conditions referred to in paragraph 64 above are satisfied, the\n        mechanism registry administrator shall:\n        (a)     Track the A6.4ERs affected by the change of authorization and held in the activity\n                participant accounts, and change their authorization in accordance with the\n                change of authorization;\n        (b)     Track the A6.4ERs that were forwarded or first transferred, as applicable, to the\n                SoP account and change their authorization;\n\n\n34 For example, a Party provides a post-issuance authorization which updates MCUs in the registry to\n\n  AERs, but the accounts which hold the affected MCUs are not authorized to hold AERs.\n35 Conditions referred to in the activity cycle procedures.\n\n36 Conditions referred to in the activity cycle procedures\n\n\n\n\n                                                  16 of 22\nA6.4-PROC-REGS-001\nProcedure: Article 6.4 mechanism registry\nVersion 02.1\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     Track the A6.4ERs that were forwarded or first transferred, as applicable, to the\n                mandatory cancellation for OMGE account and change their authorization.\n66.     If the mechanism registry’s check (referred to in paragraph 64 above) identifies the\n        conditions related to providing a post-issuance change of authorization of the affected\n        A6.4ERs are not satisfied, the secretariat shall communicate this to the host Party.\n\n7.

Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism).1 Chapter XI.A of the RMPs contains provisions that allow\n          transition of project activities and programmes of activities (PoAs) registered under the\n          clean development mechanism (CDM) under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol or listed as\n          provisional as per the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Board of the CDM 2\n          (hereinafter referred to as provisional requests) to the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated key conditions and processes for such\n          transition.3 At the same session, the CMA also requested4 the Supervisory Body to\n          facilitate the tasks related to the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\n          by:\n          (a)      Developing and operationalizing a procedure for requesting transition, which\n                   includes relevant forms, by no later than June 2023;\n          (b)      Developing and operationalizing the transition process and reporting back to the\n                   CMA at its fifth session.\n3.        The CMA, at its sixth session,5 decided that afforestation and reforestation project\n          activities and programmes of activities registered under the CDM may transition to the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism and be registered as Article 6.4 activities. The CMA also elaborated\n          key conditions for such a transition.\n4.        Pursuant to its mandate from the CMA to operationalize the transition process, the\n          Supervisory Body has adopted the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article\n          6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) as contained in this document\n          and the “Procedure: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter\n          referred to as the transition procedure) and relevant forms.\n5.        The Supervisory Body at its 16th meeting agreed to provisions on avoidance of double\n          issuance for provisional requests for issuance for transition activities. The Supervisory\n          Body further decided to require the use of re-evaluated values for the fraction of non-\n\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10a01E.pdf .\n2    At its 108th meeting (see paragraphs 7‒8 of the meeting report) and later clarified in the document entitled\n     “Clarification: Regulatory requirements under temporary measures for post-2020 cases” available at\n     http://cdm.unfccc.int/sunsetcms/storage/contents/stored-file-20220314132358671/Reg_Clar03v02.pdf.\n3    Decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapter I, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/10/Add.2\n     available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_10a02E.pdf .\n4    Decision 7/CMA.4, paragraph 23.\n5    Decision -/CMA.6 \"Further guidance on the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the\n     Paris Agreement” (Advance unedited version), Section VI. Transition of clean development mechanism\n     activities, paragraph 21 (a-c). Available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/CMA_6_agenda%20item15b_AUV_2.pdf .\n\n\n                                                      3 of 14\nA6.4-STAN-AC-001\nStandard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 04.0\n\n\n\n          renewable biomass (fNRB) and the discount factor for the leakage for activities using CDM\n          methodologies that have a risk of non-permanence of emission reductions.\n\n2.        Objective and scope\n6.        This standard sets out required activity design and other attributes of CDM project\n          activities, PoAs and component project activities (CPAs) therein that may transition to the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism, as well as corresponding requirements for provisional requests\n          that may be finalized under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n3.        Entry into force\n7.        This document enters into force on 16 May 2025.\n\n4.        Terms and definitions\n8.        The following terms apply in this standard:\n          (a)     “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;\n          (b)     “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action\n                  is recommended as particularly suitable;\n          (c)     “May” is used to indicate what is permitted;\n          (d)     “The project participant” shall be read as the focal point entity designated by the\n                  project participants of the CDM project activity or PoA for scope (c) as\n                  communicated to the secretariat in the modalities of communication in accordance\n                  with the relevant provisions in the “CDM project cycle procedure for project\n                  activities” and the “CDM project cycle procedure for programmes of activities”,\n                  respectively.6\n          (e)     “CDM project activity”, “PoA” and “CPAs” encompass CDM emission reduction and\n                  CDM A/R activities, unless otherwise specified;\n          (f)     “PDD”, “PoA-DD” and “CPA-DD” encompass the respective forms for CDM\n                  emission reduction and CDM A/R activities, unless otherwise specified.\n\n5.        Transition requirements on crediting period\n5.1.      Project activities\n9.        A CDM project activity may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism if its crediting period\n          would have been active as of 1 January 2021 had the crediting period under the CDM\n\n\n6    In accordance with paragraph 42 of the “CDM project cycle procedure for project activities” (version\n     03.0), and paragraph 33 of the “CDM project cycle procedure for programmes of activities” (version 03.0),\n     the focal point entities designated by the project participants for scope (c) are granted the authority to\n     communicate on their behalf with the Board and the secretariat on all other project-related matters not\n     covered by: (a) communication in relation to requests for forwarding of certified emission reductions to\n     individual accounts of the project participants; or (b) communication in relation to requests for addition\n     and/or voluntary withdrawal of the project participants and focal points, as well as changes to company\n     names, legal status, contact details and specimen signatures.\n\n\n                                                     4 of 14\nA6.4-STAN-AC-001\nStandard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 04.0\n\n\n\n       continued after the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, provided\n       it meets design requirements for transition as contained in section 6 below.\n10.    The crediting period type (i.e. renewable or fixed) of the transitioning CDM project activity\n       shall not change at and after the transition.\n11.    For a CDM project activity with the renewable crediting period type that successfully\n       transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism:\n       (a)      The current crediting period under the Article 6.4 mechanism shall start on\n                1 January 2021 and end, whichever is earlier:\n                (i)     When the current crediting period would have ended had the crediting period\n                        under the CDM continued after the end of the second commitment period of\n                        the Kyoto Protocol;\n                (ii)    On 31 December 2025;\n                (iii)   On the date determined under the conditions of the crediting period that may\n                        be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(b) of the\n                        RMPs;\n       (b)      The maximum remaining number of renewals of crediting period under the CDM\n                prior to the transition shall be carried over to the Article 6.4 mechanism unless the\n                host Party specifies that the crediting period may not be renewed pursuant to\n                paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs;\n       (c)      After the first renewal of the crediting period under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the\n                duration of each subsequent crediting period shall be the same as that for any new\n                Article 6.4 mechanism activities (A6.4 activities) (i.e. a maximum of 5 years or, for\n                activities involving removals, 15 years), subject to approval by the Supervisory\n                Body or any shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to\n                paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs.\n12.    For a CDM project activity with the fixed crediting period type that successfully transitioned\n       to the Article 6.4 mechanism, the current crediting period under the Article 6.4 mechanism\n       shall start on 1 January 2021 and end, whichever is earlier:\n       (a)      When the current crediting period would have ended had the crediting period under\n                the CDM continued after the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto\n                Protocol;\n       (b)      On the date determined under the conditions of the crediting period that may be\n                specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs.\n\n5.2.   Programmes of activities\n13.    A CDM PoA may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism if its PoA period would have been\n       active as of 1 January 2021 had the PoA period under the CDM continued after the end\n       of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, provided it meets design\n       requirements for transition as contained in section 6 below.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5 of 14\nA6.4-STAN-AC-001\nStandard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 04.0\n\n\n\n14.    For a CDM PoA that successfully transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism:\n       (a)      The current PoA period under the Article 6.4 mechanism shall start on 1\n                January 2021 and end, whichever is earlier:\n                (i)     When the current PoA period would have ended had the PoA period under\n                        the CDM continued after the end of the second commitment period of the\n                        Kyoto Protocol;\n                (ii)    On 31 December 2025;\n                (iii)   On the date determined under the conditions of the PoA period that may be\n                        specified by the respective host Party(ies) in accordance with paragraph\n                        27(b) of the RMPs;\n       (b)      The maximum remaining number of renewals of PoA periods under the CDM prior\n                to the transition shall be carried over to the Article 6.4 mechanism unless the host\n                Party specifies that the PoA period may not be renewed pursuant to paragraph\n                27(b) of the RMPs;\n       (c)      After the first renewal of the PoA period under the Article 6.4 mechanism, the\n                duration of each subsequent PoA period shall be the same as that for any new\n                Article 6.4 mechanism PoAs (i.e. 5 years, or for activities involving removals, 15\n                years), subject to approval by the Supervisory Body or any shorter PoA period\n                specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs.\n\n5.3.   Component project activities\n15.    The CPAs included in a CDM PoA that is eligible for transition in accordance with\n       paragraph 13 above may transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism if their crediting periods\n       would have been active as of 1 January 2021 had the crediting periods under the CDM\n       continued after the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, provided\n       they meet design requirements for transition as contained in section 6 below.\n16.    The transition of CPAs shall be in conjunction with, or subsequent to the transition of the\n       CDM PoA that they are included in, in accordance with the transition procedure.\n17.    The crediting period type, the end of the current crediting period, the renewability of the\n       crediting period after transition, and the duration of each subsequent crediting period after\n       the first renewal under the Article 6.4 mechanism of transitioning CPAs shall follow the\n       same rules for transitioning CDM project activities referred to in paragraphs 10‒12 above.\n\n5.4.   Activities in provisional requests\n18.    The crediting period type, the duration of each crediting period, and the renewability of the\n       crediting period of the project activities in the provisional requests for registration shall\n       follow the same rules for any new Article 6.4 mechanism projects.\n19.    The duration of each PoA period and the renewability of the PoA period of the PoAs in the\n       provisional requests for registration shall follow the same rules for any new Article 6.4\n       mechanism PoAs.\n20.    The crediting period type, the duration of each crediting period, and the renewability of the\n       crediting period of the CPAs in the inclusion listed as provisional under the temporary\n       measures shall follow the same rules for any new Article 6.4 mechanism CPAs.\n\n\n\n                                                 6 of 14\nA6.4-STAN-AC-001\nStandard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 04.0\n\n\n\n\n6.     Transition requirements on activity design\n6.1.   Activity type\n21.    The activity type of a CDM project activity, or PoA and the CPAs therein, that may\n       transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism shall be among those indicated publicly by the host\n       Party to the Supervisory Body as it would consider approving pursuant to paragraph 26(e)\n       of the RMPs.\n\n6.2.   Methodology\n22.    A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4\n       mechanism may continue to apply the currently applied CDM methodology until the earlier\n       of the end of the current crediting period or PoA period as applicable, or 31 December\n       2025. After that date, it shall apply an Article 6.4 mechanism methodology (hereinafter\n       referred to as mechanism methodology).\n23.    For a CDM project activity or CPA with the fixed crediting period type, if the replacement\n       of the currently applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology is due before\n       the end of the current crediting period under the Article 6.4 mechanism, such replacement\n       shall be made through the post-registration change process applicable to any new A6.4\n       activities.\n24.    Notwithstanding the provision in paragraph 22 above, if the currently applied CDM\n       methodology does not meet the methodological requirements that may be specified by the\n       host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, it shall be replaced with a\n       mechanism methodology.\n25.    A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, may voluntarily replace the currently\n       applied CDM methodology with a mechanism methodology at transition. Also, they may\n       be required to do so in accordance with paragraph 24 above. In these cases, the project\n       design document, or PoA design document and CPA design documents, shall be revised\n       by the project participant, validated by a designated operational entity, and approved by\n       the Supervisory Body in accordance with the transition procedure.\n26.    For a transitioning CDM PoA,:\n       (a)      If the PoA continues to apply the currently applied CDM methodology at transition\n                in accordance with paragraph 22 above, no new CPA may be included in the PoA\n                until the PoA period is renewed under the Article 6.4 mechanism applying a\n                mechanism methodology;\n       (b)      The mandatory replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a\n                mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 24 above shall be made to both\n                the PoA and the CPAs therein at transition;\n       (c)      If the voluntary replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a\n                mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 25 above takes place at the PoA\n                level at transition, any new CPAs that may be included after the transition shall\n                apply the mechanism methodology, while the existing CPAs may choose to\n                continue applying the currently applied CDM methodology until the earlier of the\n                end of their respective current crediting periods or 31 December 2025, or switch to\n                the mechanism methodology at transition;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7 of 14\nA6.4-STAN-AC-001\nStandard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 04.0\n\n\n\n       (d)      If the voluntary replacement of the currently applied CDM methodology with a\n                mechanism methodology referred to in paragraph 25 above takes place for any of\n                the existing CPAs at transition, such voluntary replacement shall also take place\n                at the PoA level at transition.\n27.    A CDM project activity, or PoA and CPAs therein, that may transition to the Article 6.4\n       mechanism are in compliance with the requirement of paragraph 31(a) of the RMPs\n       regarding additionality of their mitigation of GHG emissions as long as they continue to\n       apply the CDM methodology in accordance with paragraph 22 above. If the CDM\n       methodology is replaced with a mechanism methodology mandatorily or voluntarily,\n       additionality shall be demonstrated in accordance with the relevant requirements\n       applicable to any new A6.4 activities.\n28.

For provisional requests for registration and provisional inclusions of CPAs, the same\n         requirements on the activity type, applicable methodology and GWPs, and other design\n         requirements as for transitioning CDM project activities, PoAs and CPAs referred to in\n         sections 6.1‒6.4 above shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n39.      For provisional requests for issuance, provided that the underlying CDM project activity or\n         PoA has successfully transitioned to the Article 6.4 mechanism without replacing the\n         currently applied CDM methodology, the calculation of achieved emission reductions shall\n         be revised by applying:\n         (a)     The GWPs referred to in section 6.3 above; and\n         (b)     The updated fraction of non-renewable biomass and discount factor for addressing\n                 leakage as per paragraph 34 above.\n40.      The project participants shall not claim GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n         under more than one crediting scheme. The project participants shall declare whether\n         double issuance is avoided and provide confirmation on whether the activity has been or\n         is registered under any other international, regional, national, or subnational or sector-\n         wide GHG mitigation crediting and whether the same GHG emission reductions or net\n         GHG removals being requested for issuance as A6.4ERs have not been credited and have\n         not been requested for crediting under the other crediting scheme.\n41.      If the underlying CDM project activity or PoA replaced the currently applied CDM\n         methodology with a mechanism methodology at transition mandatorily or voluntarily in\n         accordance with paragraph 24 or 25 above, respectively, provisional requests for issuance\n         shall not be eligible for finalization under the transition procedure.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The Supervisory Body, at its ninth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 activity standard for\n          projects” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that sets out the requirements relating\n          to the design, implementation and other attributes of Article 6.4 mechanism projects (A6.4\n          projects).\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the\n          requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of\n          Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies\n          standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article\n          6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article\n          6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two\n          standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4\n          mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and\n          emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas\n          the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have\n          met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental\n          risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to\n          sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of\n          the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n5.        The Supervisory Body, at its fifteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Demonstration of\n          additionality for mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the additionality\n          standard) that sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to\n          demonstrating additionality.\n\n1.2.      Objectives\n6.        The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to the design,\n          implementation and other attributes of A6.4 projects.\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex A available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10_add1_adv.pdf#page=25.\n2    Decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a).\n3    Decision 7/CMA.4, annex I, chapters III‒VI. Available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2022_10a02_adv.pdf#page=33.\n\n\n\n                                                       4 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n2.        Scope and entry into force\n2.1.      Scope\n7.        This standard provides activity participants of a proposed or registered A6.4 project with\n          minimum requirements for requesting registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism,\n          requesting approval of post-registration change, requesting issuance of Article 6,\n          paragraph 4, emission reductions (A6.4ERs), renewal of the crediting period and\n          deregistration from the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n2.2.      Entry into force\n8.        This document enters into force on 16 May 2025.\n\n3.        Terms and definitions\n9.        The following terms apply in this standard:\n          (a)      “Shall” is used to indicate requirements to be followed;\n          (b)      “Should” is used to indicate that among several possibilities, one course of action\n                   is recommended as particularly suitable;\n          (c)      “May” is used to indicate what is permitted;\n          (d)      “Activity participant” is a public or private entity that participates in an A6.4 project.\n\n4.        Principles\n10.       The following principles4 shall guide the design and implementation of an A6.4 project and\n          the monitoring of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or net GHG removals, and\n          contribute to enhancing the environmental integrity of A6.4 projects:\n          (a)      Select the GHG sources, GHG sinks, GHG reservoirs, data, methodologies and all\n                   other information that is appropriate to meet the needs of the intended user;5\n          (b)      Include all relevant GHG sources and sinks, and information to support compliance\n                   with all Article 6.4 requirements;\n          (c)      Enable meaningful comparisons of project-related information;\n          (d)      Reduce bias and uncertainties as far as it is practical/cost-effective, or otherwise\n                   use conservative assumptions, values and procedures to ensure that GHG\n                   emission reductions or net GHG removals are not overestimated;\n\n\n4    This text is adapted to the Article 6.4 mechanism and is taken from ISO 14064-2:2006 – Greenhouse\n     gases – Part 2: Specification with guidance at the project level for quantification, monitoring and reporting\n     of greenhouse gas emission reductions or removals; it is reproduced with the permission of the\n     International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Proprietary\n                or confidential information may be marked as such to prevent public disclosure by\n                the designated operational entity (DOE), the Supervisory Body or the secretariat\n                without the provider’s written consent, except as required by national law. In this\n                context, information used to determine additionality, to describe the baseline\n                methodology and its application, and to support assessments of environmental\n                impacts, social impacts and sustainable development benefits shall not be\n                considered proprietary or confidential.\n\n5.       General requirements\n5.1.     Use of applicable forms\n11.      The activity participants seeking validation of a proposed A6.4 project by a designated\n         operational entity (DOE) shall prepare a project design document (PDD) using the valid\n         version of the applicable PDD form and follow the instructions therein6.\n12.      The activity participants wishing to have the GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n         removals achieved by the implemented registered A6.4 project verified by a DOE shall\n         prepare a monitoring report for each monitoring period using the valid version of the\n         monitoring report form and follow the instructions therein.\n\n5.2.     Use of applicable global warming potentials\n13.      The activity participants shall use the 100-year time-horizon global warming potentials\n         (GWPs) from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\n         Change (IPCC) as contained in Appendix 1, or 100-year time-horizon GWP values from a\n         subsequent IPCC assessment report as agreed upon by the CMA, to calculate aggregate\n         GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved or expected to achieve by the\n         proposed or registered A6.4 project from 1 January 2021 onward, expressed in tonnes of\n         carbon dioxide equivalent.\n\n6.       Design of project\n6.1.     Demonstration of prior consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism\n14.

Double or revived registration\n17.     The activity participants shall confirm that the proposed A6.4 project is none of the\n        following:\n        (a)     Already registered as an A6.4 project;\n        (b)     Already included as a component project (CP) in a registered Article 6.4\n                mechanism programme of activities (A6.4 PoA);\n        (c)     Previously deregistered from the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n18.     Additionally, the activity participants shall confirm one of the following:\n        (a)     The proposed A6.4 project is not currently registered or being pursued for\n                registration, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional,\n                national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme;\n        (b)     The proposed A6.4 project was previously registered under or covered by a\n                programme under any other international, regional, national, or subnational or\n                sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme but deregistered or excluded from\n                the other crediting scheme before fully exhausting the crediting period under the\n                other crediting scheme;\n        (c)     The proposed A6.4 project is currently registered or covered by other international,\n                regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme.\n19.     For the cases described in paragraph 18(b) above, the activity participants shall obtain a\n        confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of deregistration or\n        exclusion and the remaining crediting period under the other crediting scheme at the time\n        of deregistration or exclusion.\n20.     For the cases described in paragraph 18(c) above, the activity participants shall obtain a\n        confirmation from the other crediting scheme of the effective date of the registration or\n        coverage, the start and end dates of the crediting period, and the monitoring periods for\n        which credits have been issued under the other crediting scheme.\n21.     If the proposed A6.4 project was a CP that has been excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA,\n        the activity participants shall ensure that:\n        (a)     The PDD transparently declares that the project was a CP that has been previously\n                excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to erroneous\n                inclusion;\n        (b)     The crediting period type (i.e., renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting\n                period are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of\n                the exclusion.

In selecting a methodology for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants may, in\n         accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies\n         and methodological tools\":\n         (a)      Propose a new methodology;\n         (b)      Propose a revision to an approved methodology;\n         (c)      Seek clarification on the applicability of an approved methodology; or\n         (d)      Request approval of deviation from an approved methodology or methodological\n                  tool.\n29.      The activity participants may select a standardized baseline that has been approved by\n         the Supervisory Body if it is valid10 and applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and to the\n         selected methodology in accordance with the applicability section of the standardized\n         baseline (hereinafter referred to as selected standardized baseline).\n\n\n9   The valid version of a methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission of the\n    request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat in accordance with the activity\n    cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version, for use in accordance with the\n    “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.\n10 The valid version of a standardized baseline is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission\n\n    of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project to the secretariat in accordance with the\n    activity cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance with\n    the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.\n\n\n\n                                                    10 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n30.     Notwithstanding paragraph 29 above, the activity participants shall select an approved\n        standardized baseline for the proposed A6.4 project if the standardized baseline is valid,\n        applicable to the proposed A6.4 project and to the selected methodology, and the selection\n        of the standardized baseline is mandatory in accordance with the applicability section of\n        the standardized baseline11 or required by the host Party in accordance with paragraph\n        27(a) of the RMPs.12\n31.     In selecting a standardized baseline for the proposed A6.4 project, the activity participants\n        may, in accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update\n        of standardized baselines” (hereinafter referred to as the standardized baseline\n        procedure):\n        (a)     Propose a new standardized baseline;\n        (b)     Propose a revision to an approved standardized baseline;\n        (c)     Seek clarification of an approved standardized baseline; or\n        (d)     Propose an updated standardized baseline.\n\n6.5.    Application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n\n6.5.1. General requirements\n32.     The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC\n        reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized\n        baselines that are applied to the proposed A6.4 project, including any other methodologies\n        or methodological tools to which the selected methodologies refer.\n33.     The activity participants shall demonstrate why the selected methodologies, standardized\n        baselines, and any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines\n        applied in accordance with the selected methodologies (hereinafter, “any other standards,\n        methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines (to be) applied in accordance with the\n        selected (applied) methodologies” are collectively referred to as the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents) are applicable to the proposed A6.4 project. This\n        shall be done by showing that the project meets all applicability conditions of these\n        regulatory documents and, if applicable, is compatible with the methodological\n        requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)\n        of the RMPs.\n34.     The activity participants shall ensure that the proposed A6.4 project complies with all the\n        requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and other\n        applied methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological\n        requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a)\n        of the RMPs.\n\n\n\n11 The date when the selection of a standardized baseline becomes mandatory is to be determined in\n\n  accordance with the “Procedure for development, revision, clarification and update of standardized\n  baselines”.\n12 Such standardized baselines may, for example, state in their applicability section that the latest approved\n\n  and valid values of the standardized baseline are the only values of the carbon dioxide emission factor(s)\n  that shall be applied for the project electricity system.\n\n\n\n                                                   11 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n6.5.2. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases\n35.     The activity participants shall describe the project boundary of the proposed A6.4 project,\n        including the physical delineation of the project using GPS coordinates where appropriate.\n        The activity participants shall further specify which sources, sinks and GHGs are included\n        within the project boundary, in accordance with the applied methodologies and the applied\n        standardized baselines. In this context, project boundary is the physical delineation or\n        geographical area that encompasses sources, sinks and GHGs under the control of the\n        activity participants, which are significant and reasonably attributable to the project in\n        accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable, the applied\n        standardized baselines.\n36.     If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity\n        participants to choose whether a source, sink or GHG is to be included in the project\n        boundary, the activity participants shall explain and justify their choice.\n\n6.5.3. Baseline scenario\n37.     The activity participants shall establish and describe the baseline scenario for the\n        proposed A6.4 project in accordance with: the applied methodologies; standardized\n        baselines; a more ambitious baseline requirement determined by the host Party and\n        approved by the Supervisory Body; other applied methodological regulatory documents;\n        and the provisions outlined in paragraphs 38–42 below and, where applicable, the\n        baseline approaches specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of\n        the RMPs.\n38.     The activity participants shall provide information on the facilities, systems and equipment\n        to be operated both under the proposed A6.4 project and the baseline scenario.\n39.     When establishing the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee that future\n        anthropogenic emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to\n        specific circumstances in the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed\n        demand in the applied methodology or propose a revision to an approved methodology to\n        cover such scenario if it is not covered in the methodology.\n40.     In case of replacement of existing equipment, the activity participants shall estimate the\n        point in time when the existing equipment would be replaced in the absence of the\n        proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the guidance on determining the remaining\n        lifetime of equipment in the applied methodology if applicable.\n41.     If the proposed A6.4 project is registered under or covered by another international,\n        regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the most\n        conservative baseline scenario between that is required by the applied methodology and\n        that is set under such other crediting scheme, in accordance with guidance to be provided\n        by the Supervisory Body.\n42.     Notwithstanding paragraphs 37‒41 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an\n        approved standardized baseline that standardizes baseline scenario, the activity\n        participants shall describe the baseline scenario as per the applied standardized baseline.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n6.5.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark\n43.       The activity participants shall identify and describe the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario\n          or reference benchmark emissions for the proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the\n          applied methodologies or other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n6.5.5. Demonstration of additionality\n44.       The activity participants shall demonstrate, in accordance with the applied methodologies,\n          other applied methodological regulatory documents, and the requirements related to prior\n          consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in section 6.1 above, that the\n          proposed A6.4 project would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism.\n45.       Activity participants shall ensure that additionality is demonstrated for an A6.4 project in\n          its entirety and is not separately demonstrated for different parts of an A6.4 project,13\n          unless the different parts can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect\n          each other.14\n46.       Additionality shall be demonstrated following the requirements for demonstration of\n          additionality included in the applied methodologies, using a robust assessment that shows\n          the project would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism.\n          This assessment should be made, taking into account all relevant national policies,\n          including legislation, and represent mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required\n          by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that avoids locking in levels of\n          emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with paragraph 33 of\n          the RMPs.\n47.       Activity participants shall, in accordance with the applied methodologies, demonstrate\n          additionality using the appropriate approaches for demonstration of additionality, including\n          regulatory analysis, analysis of lock-in risk, investment analysis, barrier analysis, common\n          practice analysis and performance-based approach.\n48.       For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the\n          PDD as part of the investment analysis.\n\n6.5.6. Addressing non-permanence for projects involving removals and emission\n       reduction projects with reversal risks\n49.       For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the\n          activity participants shall, in the PDD, identify and assess the risks of reversals, aligned\n          with the provisions of the removals standard and other applied methodological regulatory\n          documents approved by the Supervisory Body, and conduct the risk assessment in\n          accordance with the applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory\n          documents.\n50.       The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to:\n\n\n13 For example, if a project involves the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the landfill gas for\n\n     energy generation, additionality should be demonstrated for both parts together, and not separately for\n     the landfill gas capture part and for the energy generation part.\n14   For example, if the project involves the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the\n     catalytic abatement of N2O emissions at a nitric acid production plant.\n\n\n\n                                                   13 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (a)     Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity costs;\n        (b)     Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,\n                acts of terrorism, crime and war;\n        (c)     Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,\n                hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and geological\n                faults and fractures;\n        (d)     Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks.\n51.     The risk assessment shall include:\n        (a)     A risk mitigation plan using the reversal risk assessment tool to be developed by\n                the Supervisory Body to identify, assess and mitigate reversal risks; and\n        (b)     The calculation of an overall percentage-based risk rating (hereinafter referred to\n                as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals, taking\n                into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood and duration of the risks.\n52.     The risk assessment shall be reviewed and revised by activity participants and verified by\n        a DOE every five years from the start of the first crediting period and in any of the\n        circumstances referred to in paragraph 72 below.\n\n6.5.7. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals\n53.     The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex-post calculation of\n        baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by the proposed A6.4 project. The activity\n        participants shall also provide the ex-ante calculation of those for each year of the crediting\n        period, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines\n        and other applied methodological regulatory documents. If the proposed A6.4 project\n        contains more than one component, the activity participants shall apply this requirement\n        for each component separately. The activity participants shall describe all steps to be\n        undertaken for these calculations and provide all results.\n54.     For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the estimation of\n        removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the PDD in accordance with the\n        methodology(ies) applicable to the project.\n55.     The activity participants shall calculate the difference between baseline emissions and\n        BAU emissions for each year of the crediting period and the total amount over the crediting\n        period to determine a downward adjustment based on BAU.\n56.     The activity participants shall determine whether the baseline must be adjusted downward\n        as per the guidance below:\n        (a)     The activity participants shall describe in the PDD the factors and quantitative\n                methods for downward adjustment and update them at each renewal of the\n                crediting period in accordance with paragraphs 55 above and 56(b) below. Activity\n                participants shall also apply more stringent factors or quantitative methods\n                determined by the host Parties for downward adjustment, according to their\n                circumstances;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   14 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (b)     The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers the\n                economic viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and\n                decarbonization technologies, and negative emission approaches while ensuring\n                that methodologies are aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris\n                Agreement, and may be operationalized through:\n                (i)     Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies\n                        approved by the Supervisory Body that may be proposed by activity\n                        participants or stakeholders;15\n                (ii)    Factors or quantitative methods jointly developed by the Supervisory Body\n                        and the host Party;\n                (iii)   Factors or quantitative methods developed by the host Party that are\n                        specified to the Supervisory Body for approval;\n        (c)     If the downward adjustment based on the BAU referred to in paragraph 55 above\n                is greater than the downward adjustment determined based on paragraphs 56(a)\n                and 56(b) above, no further adjustment to the baseline is required; otherwise\n                further adjustment is required to align with the result of paragraphs 56(a) and 56(b)\n                above to ensure consistency with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMPs,\n                in accordance with other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n57.     The activity participants shall determine the leakage emissions in the PDD as follows:\n        (a)     Identify all potential sources of leakage that may reasonably be attributable to the\n                activity following the applicable methodology and other applied methodological\n                regulatory documents. If any of the sources of leakage is excluded from\n                consideration, proper justification shall be provided;\n        (b)     Describe how each of the sources of leakage identified above will be avoided or\n                minimized and accounted for, following the applicable methodology and other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents;\n        (c)     Take into account relevant information from the designated national authority\n                (DNA) of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of\n                other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n58.     If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide\n        different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify\n        their choice.\n59.

The monitoring plan shall also include a description of the monitoring management\n        system, including the following elements:\n        (a)     The operational and management structure to be put in place to implement the\n                monitoring plan;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   17 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (b)     Provisions to ensure that data monitored and required for verification of GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals and issuance of A6.4ERs is kept and\n                archived for at least two years after the end of the final crediting period or the last\n                issuance of A6.4ERs, whichever occurs later;\n        (c)     Definitions of responsibilities and institutional arrangements for data collection and\n                archiving.\n70.     Unless the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents state otherwise, the activity participants may opt for\n        a delayed submission of the monitoring plan, which can occur after the registration of the\n        proposed A6.4 project and:\n        (a)     At any time prior to the submission of the request for issuance of A6.4ERs for the\n                first monitoring period; or\n        (b)     Together with the request for issuance of A6.4ERs for the first monitoring period.\n71.     If the activity participants choose to delay the submission of the monitoring plan in\n        accordance with paragraph 70 above, they shall clearly state in the PDD that the\n        submission of the monitoring plan is delayed and therefore the PDD submitted for\n        registration of the proposed A6.4 project does not contain information related to the\n        monitoring plan.\n72.     For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the\n        monitoring plan and the risk assessment shall be reviewed and updated during the\n        crediting period and verified by a DOE if:\n        (a)     The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan\n                based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan and the risk assessment\n                plan;\n        (b)     Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are\n                not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;\n        (c)     The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk\n                factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring\n                plan and the risk assessment plan.\n\n6.6.

The activity participants shall determine the start date of the proposed A6.4 project as the\n        date on which they commit to making expenditures for constructing or modifying the main\n        equipment or facility (e.g., a wind turbine), or for providing or modifying a service (e.g.,\n        distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, change of transport management system) under\n        the proposed A6.4 project. If a contract for such expenditures (e.g. for procurement of a\n        wind turbine) is signed, the start date is the date on which the contract is signed. In other\n        cases, it is the date on which such expenditures are incurred. If the proposed A6.4 project\n        involves more than one of such contracts or incurred expenditures, the start date is the\n        earliest of the respective dates. Activities incurring minor pre-project expenses (e.g.,\n        feasibility studies, preliminary surveys) are not considered in the determination of the start\n        date.\n74.     The start date of the proposed A6.4 project shall be on or after 01 January 2021.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   18 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n75.     The activity participants shall specify the expected operational lifetime of the proposed\n        A6.4 project and adjust the crediting period(s) accordingly in cases where the DNA has\n        specified conditions that ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) is shorter\n        than the lifetime of the technology implemented, including any replacements undertaken\n        during the crediting period.\n76.     The activity participants shall indicate in the PDD the same crediting period type\n        (renewable or fixed), start date and duration of the crediting period for the proposed A6.4\n        project as approved by the host Party in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,\n        which is:\n        (a)     For GHG emission reduction projects:\n                (i)    Each renewable crediting period shall be maximum five years and may be\n                       renewed maximum twice, for a maximum total length of 15 years, or any\n                       shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph\n                       27(b) of the RMPs or by the applied methodologies; or\n                (ii)   A fixed crediting period shall be maximum 10 years, or any shorter crediting\n                       period specified by the host Party pursuant to paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs\n                       or by the applied methodologies;\n        (b)     For GHG removal projects, each renewable crediting period shall be maximum 15\n                years and may be renewed maximum twice, for a maximum total length of 45\n                years, or any shorter crediting period specified by the host Party pursuant to\n                paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs or by the applied methodologies.\n77.     The start date of the crediting period may be as early as 1 January 2021, but no later than\n        two years from the date of the submission of the PDD for global stakeholder consultation\n        in accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n78.     A project that has been registered as an A6.4 project may not be re-registered after the\n        expiration of its final crediting period.\n\n6.7.

If the activity participants are temporarily unable to monitor the registered A6.4 project in\n        accordance with the monitoring plan outlined in the registered PDD (hereinafter referred\n        to as the registered monitoring plan), the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,\n        including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants shall describe the nature, extent and\n        duration of the non-conforming monitoring period in the monitoring report, and:\n        (a)     Propose alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-conforming monitoring\n                period. In this case, the activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions\n                or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of\n                the deviation; or\n        (b)     Apply the following most conservative values approach when alternative\n                monitoring arrangements are not proposed:\n                (i)    If the A6.4 project is to achieve GHG emission reductions, apply zero for\n                       baseline GHG emissions for the entire non-conforming monitoring period; or\n                (ii)   Apply the values assuming that the source of GHG emissions is operated at\n                       the maximum capacity for the entire non-conforming monitoring period. In\n                       the case of project GHG emissions related to the consumption of electricity,\n                       add 10 per cent to account for transmission and distribution losses.\n96.     If the monitoring of environmental, social and sustainable development parameters results\n        in negative impacts that exceed the risks identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form and the indicators defined in both the A6.4\n        Environmental and social management plan form and in the A6.4 Sustainable\n        development impact form and cannot be remediated by conducting additional consultation\n        with stakeholders or by employing mitigation measures, the activity participants shall\n        describe the reasons for the negative impact and the measures that will be employed to\n        prevent the negative impact in the future.\n\n7.3.3.

If the activity participants make any corrections to the project information or parameters\n        fixed at the registration of the A6.4 project, as described in the registered PDD, the activity\n        participants shall document these corrections in a revised PDD.16\n\n\n\n\n16 This provision does not allow the parameter values fixed ex ante at the time of the registration of the\n\n  A6.4 project to be updated, as it is not regarded as a correction.\n\n\n\n                                                   22 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n7.3.3.2.        Changes to the start date of the crediting period\n98.     The activity participants of a registered A6.4 project may request a change to the start\n        date of the crediting period of the project if no request for issuance for the project has been\n        submitted yet and if the host Party approves the change in accordance with the activity\n        cycle procedure. In this context:\n        (a)     The new start date shall not be later than two years from the date of submission of\n                the PDD for global stakeholder consultation conducted prior to registration in\n                accordance with the activity cycle procedure;\n        (b)     Delaying the start date by up to one year or bringing forward the start date shall\n                not require any review and change to the application of methodologies and\n                standardized baselines;\n        (c)     Delaying the start date by more than one year shall require full review and possible\n                changes to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized\n                baselines.\n\n7.3.3.3.        Inclusion of monitoring plan\n99.     The activity participants may submit the monitoring plan of an A6.4 project after its\n        registration in accordance with paragraph 70 above. In this case, if, at the time of\n        submission of the monitoring plan, there is a newer version of any of the methodologies\n        applied at the registration of the project, the activity participants shall prepare the\n        monitoring plan and revise other sections of the PDD by applying the latest valid version\n        of the methodology(ies).\n\n7.3.3.4.        Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool\n                forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the\n                A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4\n                Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of\n                monitoring from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool\n100.    If the activity participants are unable to implement the registered monitoring plan, or if the\n        monitoring would permanently deviate from the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,\n        including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants shall describe the nature and extent\n        of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed alternative monitoring for the project\n        in a revised PDD.\n101.    If the monitoring would permanently deviate from the A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the activity participants shall\n        describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed\n        alternative monitoring for the project in the revised A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form.\n102.    If the monitoring plan and risk assessment plan need to be reviewed and updated as per\n        paragraph 72 above, the activity participants shall describe the changes to the monitoring\n        plan and risk assessment plan in a revised PDD.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   23 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n103.    The activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the\n        calculations in the proposed alternative monitoring, to the extent required, to ensure that\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of\n        the permanent change or deviation.\n\n7.3.3.5.        Changes to project design\n104.    Where there are changes to the project design of a registered A6.4 project, the activity\n        participants shall prepare a revised PDD describing the nature and extent of the proposed\n        or actual changes.\n105.

Where the activity participants cannot demonstrate compliance with the requirements of\n        the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents with which the A6.4 project has been registered, the\n        activity participants shall:\n        (a)     Revise the PDD, applying:\n                (i)    A later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n                       baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents; or\n                (ii)   Other methodologies, other standardized baselines or other methodological\n                       regulatory documents that are applicable to the project; and\n        (b)     Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the newly applied\n                methodologies, the newly applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n                methodological regulatory documents in the revised PDD.\n\n21 Ifa proposed or actual modification adversely impacts the additionality of the project, subsequent\n   requests for issuance of A6.4ERs based on such modifications will be rejected.\n\n\n\n                                                   26 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n7.3.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme\n110.    If an A6.4 project, after its registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism, is also registered\n        under, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional, national,\n        subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the activity participants shall\n        obtain a confirmation of such registration or coverage from the other scheme.\n\n7.4.    Reversals related actions for projects involving removals and emission\n        reductions projects with reversal risks\n111.    In case of occurrence of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that\n        could potentially lead to a reversal, activity participants shall prepare a preliminary\n        assessment report in order to determine whether the observed event has resulted in an\n        actual reversal. The report shall contain the following information:\n        (a)     A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;\n        (b)     The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the\n                monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;\n        (c)     Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a\n                summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;\n112.    If the observed event is an ongoing event, the preliminary assessment report shall be\n        prepared after the event has ended or has been fully contained.\n113.    The preliminary assessment report shall conclude, on the basis of transparent and\n        verifiable evidence, whether the observed event did or did not result in actual reversals.\n114.    If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report or if the\n        preliminary assessment concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual\n        reversal, the activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report based on the monitoring\n        plan contained in the PDD and submit it to a DOE for verification. The monitoring report\n        shall include:\n        (a)     A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;\n        (b)     The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the\n                monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;\n        (c)     Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a\n                summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;\n        (d)     Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could\n                have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions, along with a\n                summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period\n                covered by the monitoring report;\n        (e)     Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent\n                with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered PDD;\n        (f)     Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been\n                assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the\n                registered PDD.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   27 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n115.    Following the submission of the monitoring report referred in paragraph 114 above, activity\n        participants shall:\n        (a)     Review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk rating of\n                the activity as necessary, which shall include the development of plans to prevent\n                further releases of GHGs through a post-registration change;\n        (b)     Review the compliance with the requirements and safeguards contained in the\n                A6.4 SD Tool, taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts\n                caused by the reversal and develop plans to prevent the recurrence of such\n                negative environmental and social impacts;\n        (c)     Review and update the monitoring plan in case additional risk factors are identified\n                following a reversal that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the\n                monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan.\n\n8.      Implementation and monitoring\n8.1.    General requirements\n116.

If monitoring did not occur during any part of the monitoring period due\n                to force majeure circumstances or for other reasons the issuance of A6.4 ERs is\n                not sought, the monitoring report shall clearly indicate such period and explain the\n                circumstances;\n        (b)     The first monitoring period shall start from the start of the crediting period as\n                specified in the registered PDD. If actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                removals have not occurred by the start of the crediting period, the monitoring\n                report for the first monitoring period shall report zero GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals for the period until they occur;\n        (c)     If negative GHG emission reductions (i.e., net GHG emissions) have occured\n                during a monitoring period, such negative values shall be clearly indicated and\n\n\n\n\n                                                   28 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                deducted from the total amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                for that monitoring period;\n        (d)     The monitored amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals shall be\n                presented by year of occurrence in monitoring reports;\n        (e)     The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level environmental and social indicators\n                shall be presented using the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n                form of the A6.4 SD Tool, if applicable;\n        (f)     The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level sustainable development indicators\n                shall be presented using the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form of the\n                A6.4 SD Tool;\n        (g)     Monitoring reports shall be prepared chronologically and with no gaps between two\n                successive monitoring periods;\n        (h)     Monitoring results for different crediting periods shall be documented in separate\n                monitoring reports.\n121.    Notwithstanding paragraphs 120(e) and 120(f) above, for projects that have successfully\n        transitioned from the CDM and prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits\n        description report” in accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool”\n        developed under the CDM at the time of transition, the monitoring report shall include the\n        outcome of monitoring of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on\n        the document describing how the activity participant intends to monitor sustainable\n        development co-benefits of the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring\n        results in accordance with the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4\n        mechanism”.\n122.    For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the\n        monitoring reports shall be submitted within the frequency specified by the applied\n        methodologies or in shorter intervals, or following the observation of an event of GHG\n        release that could potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in section 7.4 above.\n123.    All monitoring, verifications and requests for issuance of A6.4ERs in respect of GHG\n        emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by A6.4 projects shall be calculated\n        using the GWPs contained in Appendix 1 in accordance with section 5.2 above.\n124.    The activity participants shall maintain all monitoring results for the registered A6.4 project\n        in accordance with the monitoring management system described in the registered\n        monitoring plan as per paragraph 69 above.\n\n8.2.    General information\n125.    When describing the implementation and monitoring of the registered A6.4 project, activity\n        participants shall provide, inter alia, the following information:\n        (a)     The title and UNFCCC reference number of the project;\n        (b)     Names of the activity participants involved;\n        (c)     Location of the project;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   29 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (d)     Titles, versions and UNFCCC reference numbers of the applied methodologies\n                and, where applicable, the applied standardized baselines, including any other\n                methodologies or methodological tools to which the applied methodologies refer;\n        (e)     The type, start date and duration of the crediting period;\n        (f)     The monitoring period sequence number and dates of coverage;\n        (g)     The version number of the PDD applicable to the monitoring period.\n\n8.3.    Avoidance of double issuance\n126.    The activity participants shall confirm that the reported GHG emission reductions or net\n        GHG removals for which they intend to request issuance of A6.4ERs do not overlap with\n        any of the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for which they have already\n        requested or intend to request credits under any other international, regional, national,\n        subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme. The activity participants shall\n        further acknowledge that if such double issuance is detected, the DOE will issue a\n        negative verification opinion, the request for issuance will be rejected by the Supervisory\n        Body, or the double issuance amounts will be deducted from future issuance of A6.4ERs\n        for the same A6.4 project if the requested A6.4ERs have already been issued.\n127.    If the A6.4 project is also registered under, or covered by a programme, under any other\n        international, regional, national subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting\n        scheme prior to the request for issuance, the activity participants shall also obtain a\n        confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or\n        net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have not been or will not be\n        credited under such other crediting scheme.\n\n8.4.    Description of implemented registered project\n128.    The activity participants shall provide a description of the implemented registered A6.4\n        project including:\n        (a)     A description of the installed technologies, technical processes and equipment;\n        (b)     Information on the implementation and actual operation of the project, including\n                relevant dates (e.g., construction, commissioning, start of operation). For a project\n                that consists of more than one site, the activity participants shall describe the status\n                of implementation and start date of operation for each site. For a project with\n                phased implementation, the activity participants shall indicate the progress of the\n                project achieved in each phase.\n129.    The activity participants shall indicate whether there are any temporary deviations from\n        the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents, in accordance with\n        section 7.3.2 above, or if there are any permanent changes to the registered A6.4 project\n        or the registered monitoring plan, in accordance with section 7.3.3 above (hereinafter\n        referred to as post-registration changes). For post-registration changes that have been\n        approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall indicate the dates of\n        approval.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   30 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n8.5.    Description of monitoring system\n130.    The activity participants shall describe the monitoring system, and provide diagrams\n        (graphical schemes) showing all relevant monitoring points. This description may include\n        data collection procedures (information flow including data generation, aggregation,\n        recording, calculations and reporting), organizational structure, roles and responsibilities\n        of personnel, and emergency procedures for the monitoring system.\n\n8.6.    Data and parameters\n131.    The activity participants shall provide all parameters used to calculate the baseline, BAU,\n        project and leakage GHG emissions, or the baseline and actual net GHG removals, as\n        well as other relevant parameters for the monitoring period as required by the registered\n        monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents. The activity participants shall provide\n        information on how these data and parameters were monitored.\n132.    For each parameter, the activity participants shall:\n        (a)     Provide the values of the monitored parameter necessary for calculating GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals. Where data are continuously\n                measured, they shall be presented using an appropriate time interval. For any\n                default value that is not fixed at the time of registration of the A6.4 project, the most\n                recent value shall be applied;\n        (b)     Describe the equipment used to monitor each parameter, including details on\n                accuracy class and calibration information (frequency, date of calibration and\n                validity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan;\n        (c)     Describe how the parameter is measured/calculated including the measurement\n                and recording frequency;\n        (d)     Provide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g., logbooks, daily records, surveys);\n        (e)     Provide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant;\n        (f)     Describe the QA/QC procedures applied, if applicable, as per the registered\n                monitoring plan;\n        (g)     Provide information on appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values and any\n                other relevant reference values.\n133.    If monitored data and parameters are determined through a sampling approach, the\n        activity participants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance\n        with the sampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan.\n134.    For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing\n        a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating\n        baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-ante determination,\n        or that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring a determination of these\n        values ex-ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of the\n        submission of the request for registration for this purpose, the activity participants shall\n        apply the same version of the standardized baseline monitoring until the end of the first\n        crediting period.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   31 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n135.    For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing\n        a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating\n        baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex-post determination\n        where there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of registration, the\n        activity participants may switch to the ex-ante determination, at any time during the first\n        crediting period, by applying an applicable standardized baseline that becomes available\n        after the registration and is valid at the time of the switch, and apply the same version of\n        the standardized baseline for the purpose of monitoring for the remainder of the same\n        crediting period. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline shall undergo the\n        post-registration change approval process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure,\n        and the standardized baseline shall be valid at the time of the submission of the post-\n        registration change approval request.\n136.    For a registered A6.4 project that applied a methodology or methodological tool allowing\n        a choice between ex-ante and ex-post determination of parameter values for calculating\n        baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals, if the selected crediting period type is\n        renewable, the activity participants shall, at each renewal of the crediting period, choose\n        the ex-ante or ex-post determination of parameter values, unless otherwise required by\n        the applied methodology or methodological tool, and shall follow the same rules in terms\n        of the use and validity of standardized baselines as in paragraphs 134 and 135 above.\n137.    Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form, if applicable, and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form containing all\n        parameters used to monitor the environmental and social impacts and the sustainable\n        development impacts and explaining how any negative environmental and social impacts\n        have been assessed, mitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in\n        the registered PDD.\n138.    If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the\n        DOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements\n        and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants\n        may request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4\n        SD Tool forms accordingly.\n139.    For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the\n        monitoring report as part of the investment analysis.\n\n8.7.    Calculation of emission reductions or net removals\n140.    The activity participants shall identify the formulae used by the registered A6.4 project for\n        the monitoring period and provide the calculations of the following:\n        (a)     Baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals;\n        (b)     Project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals;\n        (c)     Leakage GHG emissions;\n        (d)     GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.\n141.    Where projects involving removals also result in emission reductions, the accounting of\n        removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the monitoring report in\n        accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   32 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n142.    The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or\n        net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project with their estimates provided\n        in the registered PDD.\n143.    For any registered A6.4 project, the activity participants shall explain the cause of any\n        increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the\n        monitoring period (e.g., higher water availability, higher plant load factor), including all\n        information (i.e., data and/or parameters) that is different from what is stated in the\n        registered PDD.\n\n9.      Renewal of crediting period\n144.    The crediting period of a registered A6.4 project may be renewed if the host Party has\n        approved the renewal when approving the project prior to its registration in accordance\n        with the activity cycle procedure.\n145.    To support a request for renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project, the\n        activity participants shall, using the valid version of the applicable PDD form, update the\n        sections of the PDD of the project relating to:\n        (a)     The baseline emissions, including updating the downward adjustment as per\n                paragraphs 55 and 56 above;\n        (b)     The BAU scenario and emissions, and the difference between the baseline\n                emissions and BAU emissions as annual and total amounts with respect to the\n                crediting period to be renewed;\n        (c)     The additionality by updating the regulatory analysis;\n        (d)     The estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable);\n        (e)     The monitoring plan (if applicable);\n        (f)     The A6.4 SD Tool forms;\n        (g)     The risk assessment and monitoring plan for projects involving removals and for\n                emission reduction projects with reversal risks;\n        (h)     The crediting period.\n146.    When updating the PDD, activity participants shall apply methodologies in one of the\n        following manners:\n        (a)     The activity participants shall use the valid version of the methodologies and\n                methodological tools applied in the registered PDD; that is, either the latest version\n                at the time of the submission of the request for renewal or the previous version if\n                the submission of the request for renewal is still within the grace period of the\n                previous version for use;22\n        (b)     If any of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD was withdrawn after the\n                registration of the project and was replaced by consolidated methodologies, the\n                activity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies;\n\n22 Referredto in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and\n  methodological tools”.\n\n\n\n                                                   33 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (c)     If the project no longer meets the applicability conditions of the methodologies or\n                methodological tools mentioned in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above due to the\n                methodologies or methodological tools revisions or due to an update of the project\n                baseline, the activity participants shall either:\n                (i)    Select other applicable approved methodologies; or\n                (ii)   Request, either through the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the\n                       crediting period or by the activity participants, a clarification as to whether a\n                       deviation from the valid version of the methodologies (including consolidated\n                       methodologies thereof) or the methodological tools applied in the registered\n                       PDD, or from any other selected methodologies, or any other methodological\n                       tools applied in accordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable.\n                       This clarification shall be made under the clarification process outlined in the\n                       “Procedure for development, revision and clarification of baseline and\n                       monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”.\n147.    In updating the PDD of the registered A6.4 project in accordance with paragraphs 145 and\n        146 above, the activity participants shall consider the application of an approved\n        standardized baseline to the project as follows:\n        (a)     The activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved standardized\n                baseline if:\n                (i)    The standardized baseline is applied in the registered PDD and the valid\n                       version of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the project and to\n                       the methodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 146 above; or\n                (ii)   The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD but the valid\n                       version of the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory23 is\n                       applicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with\n                       paragraph 146 above. However, if the submission of the request for renewal\n                       of the crediting period is made within 240 days after the standardized\n                       baseline became valid, the activity participants may update the PDD without\n                       selecting the standardized baseline.\n        (b)     If the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD is\n                no longer applicable to the project and/or to the valid version of the methodologies\n                applied in the registered PDD due to a revision of the standardized baseline after\n                the registration of the project, the activity participants shall:\n                (i)    Select another applicable approved standardized baseline; or\n                (ii)   Use only the valid version of the methodologies applied in the registered PDD\n                       that are still applicable to the project and that can be used independently for\n                       estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals without using the\n                       standardized baseline applied in the registered PDD;\n        (c)     The activity participants may use the valid version of an applicable approved\n                standardized baseline if:\n                (i)    The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PDD; and\n\n\n23 For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 11.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   34 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                (ii)   The standardized baseline does not require its mandatory selection but is\n                       applicable to the project and to the methodologies applied in accordance with\n                       paragraph 146 above.\n148.    The activity participants shall demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update\n        in accordance with paragraphs 149−150 below.\n149.    To demonstrate the validity of the original baseline or its update, the activity participants\n        shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies, standardized\n        baselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n150.    If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline were determined ex-\n        ante and were not monitored during the crediting period and are no longer valid, the activity\n        participants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be\n        provided by the Supervisory Body.\n151.    The results of the process described in paragraphs 145–150 above shall be used to define\n        a new version of the PDD.\n152.    The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up to date.\n153.    If the activity participants plan to make, or have already made, a post-registration change\n        to the project design effective from the start date of the new crediting period, they shall\n        clearly indicate this change in the new version of the PDD, distinguishing it from other\n        updates of information due to renewal of the crediting period.\n\n10. Post-crediting monitoring and reporting\n154.    For projects involving removals and for emission reduction projects with reversal risks,\n        activity participants shall continue monitoring the project after the end of the last active\n        crediting period to:\n        (a)     Assess whether any reversals have occurred;\n        (b)     Quantify the amount of reversals; and\n        (c)     Confirm the continued storage of the GHGs.\n155.    Activity participants may terminate the post-crediting monitoring, subject to approval by\n        the Supervisory Body, if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable\n        information, that:\n        (a)     The stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or\n        (b)     The potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of\n                the relevant section of the removals standard (i.e., Remediation of reversals).\n\n11. Voluntary deregistration of project\n156.    The activity participants may request the secretariat to deregister an A6.4 project in\n        accordance with the activity cycle procedure at any time after the registration of the project.\n157.

Modalities of local stakeholder consultation\n\n1.      Scope and target of consultation\n1.      The scope of the local or subnational stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively\n        referred to as local stakeholder consultation) shall comprise, as a minimum, the potential\n        direct positive and negative impacts that the proposed A6.4 project may have.\n2.      The activity participants shall invite, as a minimum, representatives of local stakeholders\n        directly impacted by the proposed A6.4 project, including local communities and\n        indigenous peoples as applicable, and representatives of local authorities relevant to the\n        project.\n3.      The activity participants shall provide evidence that invitations were sent to the relevant\n        stakeholders and that their comments were invited. If any of the relevant stakeholders\n        were not invited, the activity participants shall provide appropriate justification.\n\n2.      Timing of consultation\n4.      The activity participants shall complete the local stakeholder consultation process at the\n        timing required by the rules of the host Party on local stakeholder consultation, if such\n        rules exist. If no such rules are in place, the activity participants shall complete the process\n        before, whichever the earlier of:\n        (a)     The start date of the project as defined in paragraph 73 of the main part of this\n                standard; or\n        (b)     The date of submitting the PDD of the proposed A6.4 project to a DOE for\n                validation.\n5.      For projects that do not meet the requirement referred to in paragraph 4 above, the activity\n        participants may submit a request for exemption from the requirement to the Supervisory\n        Body for its consideration on a case-by-case basis.\n\n3.      Conduct of consultation\n6.      The activity participants shall invite local stakeholders to provide comments on the\n        proposed A6.4 project in an open and transparent manner, in a way that facilitates\n        comments to be received from local stakeholders and allows for a reasonable time for\n        comments to be submitted. The activity participants shall describe the steps/actions taken\n        to invite comments, taking into account local and national circumstances.\n7.      The activity participants shall convey information to stakeholders about the local\n        stakeholder consultation and the proposed A6.4 project in ways that are appropriate for\n        the community that is directly affected by the project. In areas where a significant part of\n        the population is illiterate, the information shall be provided orally.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   37 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n8.      The activity participants shall describe the proposed A6.4 project in a manner that allows\n        local stakeholders to understand the project. The information to be made available to local\n        stakeholders shall include, inter alia:\n        (a)     A summary of the proposed A6.4 project, describing it in simple, non-technical\n                language, outlining the direct positive and negative impacts;\n        (b)     Information on the projected scope, lifetime, and direct positive and negative\n                impacts of the proposed A6.4 project;\n        (c)     A summary of the analysis of the environmental and social impacts and sustainable\n                development benefits of the proposed A6.4 project and the completed three A.4\n                SD tool forms;\n        (d)     Other relevant information about the proposed A6.4 project, taking into account\n                confidentiality provisions referred to in paragraph 10(e) of the main part of this\n                standard;\n        (e)     The means for stakeholders to provide comments on the proposed A6.4 project.\n9.      The activity participants shall conduct the local stakeholder consultation through means\n        that are appropriate for the local and national circumstances.\n10.     The activity participants shall provide local stakeholders with the opportunity to comment\n        in writing or via other means, and gather their comments about the proposed A6.4 project\n        and its direct impacts.\n11.     The activity participants shall request the DNA of the host Party to forward to them any\n        comments from local stakeholders submitted to the host Party.\n12.     The activity participants shall prepare a summary report of the comments received from\n        local stakeholders.\n13.     The activity participants shall consider the comments provided by local stakeholders and\n        report in the PDD how they have taken them into account providing justification for any\n        comments not incorporated.\n\n4.      Activities after consultation\n14.     After the completion of the local stakeholder consultation, local stakeholders may submit\n        a complaint to the DNA of the host Party if they find that the outcome of the local\n        stakeholder consultation is not appropriately taken into account. The DOE shall request\n        the DNA to forward such complaints to the DOE. The DOE shall promptly forward them to\n        the activity participants during the validation stage in accordance with the “Article 6.4\n        validation and verification standard for projects”.\n15.     If, during the validation of the proposed A6.4 project, complaints submitted to the DNA of\n        the host Party on the handling of the outcome of the local stakeholder consultation are\n        forwarded to the activity participants through the DOE, the activity participants shall take\n        due account of such complaints and modify the PDD as appropriate before the DOE\n        concludes the validation.\n\n                                                       -----\n\n\n\n\n                                                   38 of 39\nA6.4-STAN-AC-002\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                                         Document information\n\n Version      Date                      Description\n\n\n 02.0         16 May 2025               SBM 016, Annex 6.\n                                        Revision to incorporate CMA guidance, align with methodological\n                                        standards (Methodologies, Additionality and Removals), SD tool\n                                        and provisions on authorization.\n 01.0         2 November 2023           SB 008, Annex 4.\n                                        Initial adoption\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Standard\n Business Function: A6.4 activity cycle\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, A6.4 projects, activity standard\n\n\n\n\n                                                      39 of 39\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, to among others, develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated several elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The Supervisory Body, at its eighth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 validation and\n          verification standard for projects” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that sets out the\n          requirements relating to validation and verification for Article 6.4 projects (A6.4 projects).\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the\n          requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of\n          Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”4 (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies\n          standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article\n          6.4 mechanism”5 (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article\n          6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two\n          standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4\n          mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and\n          emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas\n          the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have\n          met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental\n          risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to\n          sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of\n          the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n5.        The Supervisory Body, at its fifteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Demonstration of\n          additionality for mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the additionality\n          standard) that sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to\n          demonstrating additionality.\n\n\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex.

Use of applicable forms\n19.      The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants completed the valid version of\n         the relevant forms by following the instructions therein.\n\n\n\n\n8   These principles can also be found in the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects”.\n9   Information is credible if it is authentic and is able to inspire belief or trust, and the willingness of persons\n    to accept the quality of evidence. Information is reliable if the quality of evidence is accurate and credible\n    and able to yield the same results on a repeated basis.\n\n\n\n                                                       8 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n20.     The DOE contracted to conduct validation for registration of a proposed A6.4 project, post-\n        registration changes or renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project shall\n        prepare a validation report using the valid version of the relevant validation report form 10\n        and following the instructions therein.\n21.     The DOE contracted to conduct verification and certification of the implementation of the\n        registered A6.4 project and monitored GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n        shall prepare a verification and certification report using the valid version of the relevant\n        verification and certification report form11 and following the instructions therein.\n\n5.4.    Use of applicable global warming potentials\n22.     The DOE shall determine whether the global warming potentials (GWPs) were correctly\n        applied in both the project design document (PDD) and the monitoring report, in\n        accordance with relevant requirements of the activity standard.\n\n6.      Validation for registration of projects\n6.1.    General requirements\n\n6.1.1. Overarching requirement\n23.     The DOE shall determine whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with all relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard for registration of the project under the Article 6.4\n        mechanism.\n\n6.1.2. Standard auditing techniques\n24.     The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants.\n25.     When assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of validation specified\n        throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including,\n        but not limited to:\n        (a)     Document review, involving:\n                (i)    Reviewing of data and information;\n                (ii)   Crosschecking the information provided in the PDD against independent\n                       sources of information not used to determine the reliability of information in\n                       the PDD. This may include where available, sectoral or local expertise of the\n                       DOE; and, if necessary, conducting independent background investigations;\n        (b)     Conducting follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection and telephone or e-mail\n                interviews), including:\n                (i)    Interviews with relevant stakeholders in the host country, such as personnel\n                       with knowledge of the project design and implementation;\n\n\n\n\n10 All types of validation report forms are available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n11 All types of verification and certification report forms are available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                (ii)   Crosschecks between information provided by interviewed personnel (i.e. by\n                       checking sources or other interviews) to ensure that no relevant information\n                       has been omitted;\n        (c)     Referencing to available information relating to projects or technologies similar to\n                the proposed A6.4 project under validation;\n        (d)     Reviewing the appropriateness of formulae and accuracy of calculations, based on\n                the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents;\n        (e)     Applying sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and\n                surveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory\n                Body.\n26.     It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at validation for the proposed\n        A6.4 project if:\n        (a)     Its estimated annual average of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is\n                more than 100,000 t CO2 eq; or\n        (b)     There is pre-project information that is relevant to the requirements for registration\n                of the project and may not be traceable after the implementation of the project;\n        (c)     The project is deemed to have high risk of uncertainty in terms of the achievement\n                of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals as estimated in the PDD, to be\n                determined in accordance with the relevant guidance to be provided by the\n                Supervisory Body.\n27.     For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 26 above, it is optional for the DOE to\n        conduct an on-site inspection at validation. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site\n        inspection as a means of validation, it shall describe the alternative means used and justify\n        that they are sufficient for the purpose of validation. If the DOE conducts a remote\n        inspection as an alternative means to an on-site inspection, the DOE should follow the\n        guidance contained in Appendix 1.\n28.     Where no specific means of validation is specified, the DOE shall apply the standard\n        auditing techniques described in paragraph 25 above.\n\n6.1.3. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests\n29.     If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order\n        to determine whether the proposed A6.4 project meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism\n        rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues are accurately identified,\n        formulated, discussed and concluded in the validation report.\n30.     The DOE shall raise a corrective action request (CAR) if one of the following situations\n        occurs:\n        (a)     Mistakes have been made by the activity participants that may influence the ability\n                of the proposed A6.4 project to achieve real, measurable, verifiable and additional\n                GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n        (b)     The applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have not been met;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   10 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     There is a risk that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals cannot be\n                monitored or calculated.\n31.     The DOE shall raise a clarification request (CL) if the information provided by the activity\n        participants is insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article\n        6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have been met.\n32.     The DOE shall raise a forward action request (FAR) if issues related to project\n        implementation that require review during the first verification after the validation of the\n        proposed A6.4 project are identified. The DOE shall not raise a FAR that relates to the\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements for registration of the project.\n33.     The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants take\n        appropriate actions, such as rectifying the project design and/or the PDD, or providing\n        additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s concerns. If this is not done,\n        the DOE shall not submit a request for registration of the proposed A6.4 project.\n34.     The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its validation report. This reporting\n        shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity participants, the\n        means of validation of such responses and references to any resulting changes in the\n        PDD or its supporting documents, in accordance with paragraph 33 above.\n\n6.2.    Validation of compliance with specific requirements for registration\n\n6.2.1. General\n35.     The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in\n        sections 5 and 6.1 above, whether the proposed A6.4 project complies with all relevant\n        requirements for registration as contained in the activity standard, including the\n        requirements on:\n        (a)     Notification of prior consideration of the Article 6.4 mechanism;\n        (b)     Compliance with the host Party’s indication of activity types that it would approve;\n        (c)     Description of the project;\n        (d)     Avoidance of double or revived registration;\n        (e)     Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines and their applicability to\n                the project;\n        (f)     Deviation from or revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool, if\n                applicable;\n        (g)     Application of methodologies and standardized baselines, including in terms of:\n                (i)     Defining of the project boundary and identifying of sources, sinks and GHGs\n                        included in the project boundary, and identifying of leakage;\n                (ii)    Identifying of baseline scenario;\n                (iii)   Demonstrating of additionality;\n                (iv)    Assessing the risk of non-permanence of GHG emission reductions or net\n                        GHG removals and measures to address reversals if they occur;\n\n\n\n                                                   11 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                (v)    Estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (vi)   Developing a monitoring plan;\n        (h)     Specification of the project start date, crediting period type, and duration;\n        (i)     Analysis of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development\n                impacts;\n        (j)     Undergoing local or subnational stakeholder consultation;\n        (k)     Undergoing global stakeholder consultation;\n        (l)     Approval of the project by the host Party;\n        (m)     Authorization of activity participants by the host Party and other participating\n                Parties;\n        (n)     Preparation of the modalities of communication statement.\n36.     When validating the compliance of the proposed A6.4 project with the requirements for\n        registration referred to in paragraph 35 above, the DOE shall additionally follow the\n        specific guidance on validation regarding some of these requirements provided in sections\n        6.2.2−6.2.12 below.\n\n6.2.2. Treatment of double or revived registration\n37.     The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to double or\n        revived registration contained in the activity standard, based on publicly available\n        information and/or information provided by the activity participants upon the DOE’s\n        request.\n\n6.2.3. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines\n38.     The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are compatible with\n        the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance\n        with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable.\n39.     If, based on local and sectoral knowledge, the DOE is aware that comparable information\n        is available from credible sources other than that used in the PDD, it shall cross-check the\n        PDD against such other sources to confirm that the A6.4 project meets the applicability\n        conditions of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n40.     The DOE shall determine whether the proposed A6.4 project has selected the\n        standardized baselines where their selection is mandatory.\n41.     If the DOE cannot determine the applicability of a selected methodology, methodological\n        tool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed A6.4 project, the DOE shall request a\n        clarification on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision\n        and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and/or the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   12 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4. Deviation from methodology or methodological tool\n42.     The DOE may seek a clarification from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a\n        deviation from the selected approved methodology or methodological tool in accordance\n        with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and\n        methodological tools” prior to the submission of a request for registration, if the DOE, when\n        performing validation of the proposed A6.4 project, or upon request from the activity\n        participants, finds that, due to a project-specific12 issue implying that a revision of the\n        methodology and/or methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the\n        project deviated from:\n        (a)     The selected methodology or methodological tool; or\n        (b)     Sections in the selected methodology or methodological tool that are not\n                standardized by the selected standardized baselines, in cases where the proposed\n                A6.4 project applies standardized baselines.\n43.     The DOE shall submit an assessment of the case including demonstration that the\n        deviation does not require revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool.\n        The DOE shall include a description of the impact of the deviation on GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals by the proposed A6.4 project.\n44.     Alternatively, if the DOE considers that a revision of the selected methodology or\n        methodological tool would be required to address the project situation, then the DOE shall\n        submit, or shall request the activity participants to submit, a request for revision of the\n        selected methodology or methodological tool in accordance with the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.\n\n\n\n\n12 Examples of project-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n  (a)   The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a\n        certain method. The activity participants of the proposed A6.4 project face a difficulty in acquiring\n        the specified instrumentation or a difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however,\n        they can achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative\n        instrumentation or measurement method;\n  (b)   A proposed A6.4 project does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology\n        for a certain parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the project to estimate the\n        parameter with equal reliability and accuracy;\n  (c)   A minor deviation is sought for a project-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative.\n        For example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5% of\n        rated capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the plant\n        has never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated\n        capacity (20% below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying conservative\n        approaches to calculate the emission reduction in such a project-specific case;\n  (d)   A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to\n        project-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology. For example, a well-\n        justified conservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to\n        address uncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period.\n\n\n\n                                                   13 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n\n6.2.5.1.        Host Party methodological requirements\n45.     The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents are applied in a way to\n        comply with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in\n        accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable.\n\n6.2.5.2.        Project boundary, sources, leakage and greenhouse gases\n46.     If the applied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines allow the activity\n        participants to choose whether a source or gas is to be included within the project\n        boundary, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have justified that\n        choice and whether the justification provided is reasonable.\n47.     If the DOE identifies emission sources that will be affected by the implementation of the\n        proposed A6.4 project and which are expected to contribute more than 1 per cent of the\n        overall expected average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, and\n        these sources are not addressed by the applied methodologies or the applied\n        standardized baselines, the DOE shall request a clarification of, revision to, or deviation\n        from, the methodologies or the standardized baselines, as appropriate, in accordance with\n        the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and\n        methodological tools” or the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update\n        of standardized baselines”.\n\n6.2.5.3.        Baseline scenario\n48.     If the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the\n        identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on its expertise\n        and local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are considered by\n        the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those required by the\n        methodologies are realistic and credible in the context of the proposed A6.4 project and\n        that no alternative scenario has been excluded. The DOE shall assess whether a more\n        ambitious baseline requirement, as determined by the host Party and approved by the\n        Supervisory Body, has been applied in the identification of the most plausible baseline\n        scenario, if applicable.\n49.     The DOE shall determine whether the most plausible baseline scenario identified is\n        reasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the PDD.\n50.     Notwithstanding of paragraphs 48 and 49 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an\n        approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the DOE shall\n        determine whether the baseline scenario for the project is the scenario specified by the\n        applied standardized baseline.\n6.2.5.4.        Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark\n51.     The DOE shall assess whether the identification and the description in the PDD of the\n        business-as-usual (hereinafter referred to as BAU) scenario or reference benchmark\n        emissions comply with the requirements of the activity standard, applied methodologies\n        and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   14 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5.5.        Demonstration of additionality\n52.     The DOE shall determine whether the additionality of the proposed A6.4 project is\n        demonstrated in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines and the applied methodological tools for demonstration of additionality, if any,\n        by verifying the reliability and credibility of all data used, and rationales, assumptions and\n        justifications provided by the activity participants, and critically assessing the evidence\n        presented, using local knowledge and sectoral and financial expertise.\n53.     The DOE shall determine whether the additionality is demonstrated for the A6.4 project in\n        its entirety and not separately demonstrated for different parts of the A6.4 project,13 unless\n        the different parts can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect each\n        other.14\n54.     Notwithstanding paragraph 52 above, if the proposed A6.4 project applies an approved\n        standardized baseline that standardizes additionality, the DOE shall determine whether\n        the project meets the additionality criteria (e.g. positive lists of technologies) in the applied\n        standardized baseline.\n6.2.5.6.        Addressing non-permanence for projects involving removals and emission\n                reduction projects with reversal risks\n55.     The DOE shall determine whether the risks of reversals were identified and assessed in\n        compliance with the requirements of the activity standard, provisions of the removals\n        standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n56.     The DOE shall determine whether the risk assessment was conducted in accordance with\n        the applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n57.     The DOE shall assess the revised risk assessment every five years from the start of the\n        first crediting period and in any of the following circumstances:\n        (a)     The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan\n                based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan and the risk assessment\n                plan;\n        (b)     Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are\n                not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;\n        (c)     The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk\n                factors that are not included or are not adequately assessed in the monitoring plan\n                and the risk assessment plan.\n\n6.2.5.7.        Estimation of emission reductions or net removals\n58.     Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or\n        parameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided\n\n13 For example, if a project involves the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the landfill gas for\n\n  energy generation, additionality should be demonstrated for both parts together, and not separately for\n  the landfill gas capture part and for the energy generation part.\n14 For example, if a project involves the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the catalytic\n\n  abatement of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at a nitric acid production plant.\n\n\n\n                                                   15 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (based on the choice of the baseline scenario, the context of the proposed A6.4 project\n        and other evidence provided), and that the correct equations and parameters have been\n        used, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines\n        and the other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n59.     The DOE shall verify the justification given in the PDD for the choice of data and\n        parameters used in the equations as follows:\n        (a)     Data and parameters fixed ex ante: If data and parameters will not be monitored\n                throughout the crediting period of the proposed A6.4 project but have already been\n                determined and will remain fixed throughout the crediting period, the DOE shall\n                determine whether all data sources and assumptions are appropriate and\n                calculations are correct as applicable to the proposed A6.4 project, and will result\n                in an accurate or otherwise conservative estimate of GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals;\n        (b)     Data and parameters to be monitored: For data and parameters that will be\n                monitored or estimated on implementation and hence become available only after\n                validation of the proposed A6.4 project, the DOE shall determine whether the\n                estimates provided in the PDD for these data and parameters are reasonable;\n        (c)     If the applied methodologies require that any of the data, parameters or estimates\n                be determined based on sampling in accordance with the standard for sampling\n                and surveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the\n                Supervisory Body, the DOE shall determine whether the sampling efforts were\n                undertaken in accordance with such standard.\n60.     For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the DOE shall\n        assess whether the estimation of removals and emission reductions is separated and was\n        undertaken in accordance with the applied methodology(ies).\n61.     The DOE shall determine whether the correct approach was applied for the estimation of\n        BAU emissions, baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage emissions in\n        accordance with the relevant provisions of the activity standard and applied\n        methodology(ies).\n62.     The DOE shall assess whether the difference between the baseline emissions and BAU\n        emissions as an annual and total amount with respect to the crediting period was\n        estimated correctly.\n63.     The DOE shall assess whether the downwards adjustment of the baseline, if applicable,\n        was applied in compliance with the requirements of the activity standard and the\n        respective provisions of the methodologies standard, applied methodologies and other\n        applied methodological regulatory documents.\n64.     The DOE shall determine whether the leakage emissions were identified, described and\n        calculated in accordance with the activity standard and relevant applied methodologies\n        and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n65.     The DOE shall also assess whether the leakage emissions are avoided or minimized and\n        accounted for in line with the respective requirements of the activity standard, applied\n        methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   16 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n6.2.5.8.        Monitoring plan\n66.     The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring plan is in accordance with the\n        requirements of the activity standard and is feasible to implement, including the feasibility\n        of the monitoring arrangements, and whether the means of implementation of the\n        monitoring plan, including the data management and quality assurance and quality control\n        procedures, are sufficient to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n        can be reported ex post and verified.\n67.     If the activity participants chose to delay the submission of the monitoring plan for the\n        proposed A6.4 project in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE shall confirm and\n        document that the submission of the monitoring plan is delayed.\n68.     For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the\n        DOE shall assess the revised monitoring plan every five years from the start of the first\n        crediting period and in any of the circumstances included in paragraph 57 above.\n6.2.6. Start date, crediting period type, and duration\n69.     The DOE shall determine whether the start date of the project is on or after 1 January\n        2021 and whether it has been determined in accordance with the relevant requirements\n        of the activity standard.\n70.     The DOE shall determine whether the type (i.e. renewable or fixed) and the length of the\n        crediting period of the proposed A6.4 project are in line with those that may be specified\n        by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(b) of the RMPs, if applicable.\n71.     In cases where the DNA specified conditions that ensure that the total length of the\n        crediting period(s) is shorter than the lifetime of the technology implemented including any\n        replacements undertaken during the crediting period, the DOE shall determine whether\n        the crediting period(s) was/were adjusted accordingly.\n6.2.7.

Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan and/or the A6.4 SD Tool\n       forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4\n       Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable\n       development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other\n       methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool\n89.     The DOE shall determine whether there is a temporary deviation from the monitoring plan\n        in the registered PDD, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social\n        management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), the applied\n        methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological\n        regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool and, if there is, the DOE shall determine\n        whether the temporary deviation complies with the relevant requirements in the activity\n        standard.\n90.     If the deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the A6.4\n        Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and\n        social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), the\n        applied methodologies, the A6.4 SD Tool or the applied standardized baselines is\n        applicable to the monitoring period under verification and part of the previous or\n        subsequent monitoring period, the DOE shall determine the exact period to which the\n        deviation applies.\n\n7.2.3. Permanent changes\n\n7.2.3.1.        Corrections\n91.     If the activity participants have made corrections to project information or parameters fixed\n        at registration of the A6.4 project as described in the registered PDD, the DOE shall\n        determine whether:\n        (a)     The corrected information is an accurate reflection of actual project information;\n                and/or\n\n\n\n                                                   22 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     The corrected parameters are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the\n                registered monitoring plan, the applied standardized baselines and the other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n7.2.3.2.        Inclusion of monitoring plan\n92.     If the activity participants chose to omit a monitoring plan at registration of the A6.4 project\n        and wish to include it thereafter, the DOE shall determine whether the design of the\n        monitoring plan and other sections of the PDD comply with the relevant requirements in\n        the activity standard in accordance with section 6.2.5 above.\n\n7.2.3.3.        Changes to the start date of the crediting period\n93.     The DOE shall determine whether there has been no request for issuance having been\n        submitted for the A6.4 project based on the information on the UNFCCC website and\n        whether the change is within the allowable limit specified in the activity standard.\n94.     If the DOE determines that both conditions referred to in paragraph 93 above are met, the\n        DOE shall further determine whether the change would require full review and possible\n        change to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n        in accordance with the activity standard, and conduct validation accordingly.\n\n7.2.3.4.        Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or A6.4 SD Tool\n                forms (the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form,\n                A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable\n                development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring from the\n                applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other methodological\n                regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool\n95.     The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring\n        plan described in the revised PDD are in compliance with the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents.\n96.     The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring\n        plan or the permanent deviation of the monitoring from the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological regulatory documents\n        is likely to lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation of GHG emission reductions\n        or net GHG removals, and if so, the DOE shall request the activity participants to apply\n        conservative assumptions or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to\n        ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as\n        a result of the permanent change or the permanent deviation.\n97.     The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the A6.4 SD Tool forms (the\n        A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and\n        social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), provided\n        as part of the revised PDD, are in compliance with the A6.4SD Tool and relevant\n        provisions of the activity standard.\n98.     For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the\n        DOE shall determine whether the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan were\n        reviewed and updated in accordance with relevant provisions of the activity standard,\n\n\n\n\n                                                   23 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        removals standard and other applied methodology regulatory documents every five years\n        and in the circumstances specified in paragraph 57 above.\n\n7.2.3.5.        Changes to the project design\n99.     In case of an actual change, the DOE shall, in its judgement, by means of an on-site\n        inspection or remote inspection and review of the description in the revised PDD submitted\n        by the activity participants of the nature and extent of the actual change, determine\n        whether this description accurately reflects the implementation, operation and monitoring\n        of the modified A6.4 project.\n100.    The DOE shall, by means of an on-site inspection or remote inspection, assess the\n        impacts of the actual change on the monitoring plan, the level of accuracy of the monitoring\n        activity, and compliance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n101.    The DOE shall, by means of reviewing the revised PDD against applicable methodological\n        requirements, determine whether the proposed or actual change would adversely affect\n        the conclusions of the validation report of the registered PDD with regard to:\n        (a)     The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents with which the A6.4 project has been registered;\n        (b)     The project boundary and any implications on the inclusion or exclusion of\n                emission sources or removal sinks and leakage emissions;\n        (c)     The compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents;\n        (d)     The level of accuracy and completeness of the monitoring compared with the\n                requirements contained in the registered monitoring plan, including the frequency\n                of measurements, the quality of monitoring equipment (e.g. calibration\n                requirements, the quality assurance and quality control procedures);\n        (e)     The additionality of the project;\n        (f)     Compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool.\n102.    For projects that demonstrate additionality through investment analysis for which the PDD\n        was submitted for validation prior to the start date of the project, and for which the updated\n        investment analysis is submitted as a post-registration change, the DOE shall determine\n        whether the investment analysis has been updated based on the data and information for\n        the investment analysis available at the start date of the project in accordance with the\n        relevant provisions of the activity standard and other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents.\n103.    If the proposed or actual change affects the additionality of the registered A6.4 project, the\n        DOE shall confirm that the project is still additional after the change.\n104.    Notwithstanding paragraph 103 above, if the registered A6.4 project applies an approved\n        standardized baseline that standardizes additionality and if the proposed or actual\n        changes affect the additionality of the project, the DOE shall determine whether the project\n\n\n\n\n                                                   24 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        with the changes meets the additionality criteria (e.g. positive list of technologies) in the\n        applied standardized baseline.\n105.    The DOE shall determine whether the revised PDD complies with all the requirements of\n        the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents.\n106.    If the applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines have been updated to a later\n        valid version of them, or changed to other methodologies or standardized baselines, the\n        DOE shall confirm that the revised PDD meets all requirements of the updated/changed\n        methodologies, including the standards, methodological tools and guidelines applied in\n        accordance with the updated/changed methodologies, and/or the updated/changed\n        standardized baselines.\n107.    The DOE shall confirm the date when the change occurred, the reasons for the change\n        and whether the change would have been known prior to the registration of the A6.4\n        project, and determine how the change would impact on the overall operation/ability of the\n        A6.4 project to deliver GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals as stated in the\n        registered PDD, and whether the revised estimation of GHG emission reductions or net\n        GHG removals due to the change takes into account the applicable limits in accordance\n        with the activity standard.\n108.    In validating the revised PDD containing the proposed or actual change, and in preparing\n        the validation report, the DOE shall include information on how the findings of previous\n        verification and certification reports, if any, have been taken into account.\n109.    If the changes to the project design affect the identification, assessment or monitoring of\n        environmental, social or sustainable development impacts, the DOE shall assess whether\n        the impacts caused by the changes were assessed and revised versions of the A6.4\n        Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and\n        social management plan form (if applicable) and A6.4 Sustainable development impact\n        form were provided. The DOE shall assess, prior to or as part of the first verification of\n        emission reductions or net removals, whether the revised A6.4 SD Tool forms are in\n        compliance with the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool.\n\n7.2.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme\n110.    The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to registration\n        under or coverage by a programme, under any other international, regional, national, or\n        subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme contained in the activity\n        standard based on the publicly available information and/or the information provided by\n        the activity participants upon its request.\n\n7.3.    Validation report\n111.    In its validation report for the post-registration changes, the DOE shall:\n        (a)     Report on all items listed in paragraph 82 above except for subparagraph 82(e);\n        (b)     Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusion on the assessment of:\n                (i)    Whether the revised PDD was prepared using the valid version of the\n                       applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   25 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                (ii)    Whether the information transferred to the later valid version of the PDD is\n                        materially the same as that in the registered PDD, as applicable;\n                (iii)   Whether the revised PDD was prepared in both track-change and clean\n                        versions;\n                (iv)    Whether the revised A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                        assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form\n                        and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form are prepared using the valid\n                        version of the applicable forms and following the instructions therein, as\n                        applicable;\n                (v)     Whether the proposed or actual post-registration change complies with each\n                        requirement for post-registration change conducted in accordance with\n                        sections 7.1‒7.2 above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the\n                        activity participants and how they have been addressed by them.\n112.    The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the validation outcome, which will be one\n        of the following options:\n        (a)     A positive validation opinion and the date of submission of the validation report as\n                part of the request for approval of post-registration change to the secretariat; or\n        (b)     A negative validation opinion, including the reasons for the post-registration\n                change as documented having been determined as not complying with the relevant\n                requirements for post-registration changes.\n\n8.      Verification of implementation and monitoring\n8.1.    General requirements\n\n8.1.1. Overarching requirements\n113.    The DOE shall:\n        (a)     Determine whether the registered A6.4 project has been implemented and is\n                operating in accordance with the registered PDD;\n        (b)     Determine whether GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals have been\n                monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan.\n\n8.1.2. Other requirements\n114.    The DOE shall assess both quantitative and qualitative information on GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals provided in the monitoring report.18\n115.    In addition to the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall review:\n        (a)     The registered PDD, including the registered monitoring plan and/or the changes\n                from the registered PDD, and the corresponding validation opinion;\n\n18 Quantitative information comprises the reported numbers in the monitoring report. Qualitative information\n\n  comprises information on internal management controls, calculation procedures, procedures for transfer\n  of data, frequency of the monitoring reports, and review and internal audit of calculations.\n\n\n\n                                                   26 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     The validation report;\n        (c)     Previous verification and certification reports, if any;\n        (d)     The applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents;\n        (e)     The monitoring results of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable\n                development impacts of the registered A6.4 project;\n        (f)     Any other information and references relevant to the GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals by the registered A6.4 project (e.g. IPCC reports, data on\n                electricity generation in the national grid or laboratory analysis and national\n                regulations).\n116.    In addition to reviewing the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall determine whether\n        the activity participants have addressed the FARs identified during validation or previous\n        verification(s).\n\n8.1.3. Quality of evidence\n117.    When verifying the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the DOE\n        shall confirm that there is an audit trail that contains the evidence and records that validate\n        or invalidate the stated figures. The audit trail shall include the source documents that form\n        the basis for assumptions and other information underlying the GHG data.\n118.    When assessing the audit trail, the DOE shall:\n        (a)     Address whether there is sufficient evidence available, both in terms of frequency\n                (time period between evidence) and coverage (in covering the full monitoring\n                period);\n        (b)     Address the source and nature of the evidence (external or internal, oral or\n                documented);\n        (c)     Cross-check the monitoring report against other sources, where available, such as\n                comparable information from sources other than those used in the monitoring\n                report to determine whether the stated figures are correct.\n119.    The DOE shall only certify GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that are based\n        on verifiable evidence.\n\n8.1.4. Application of materiality\n\n8.1.4.1.        General\n120.    The concept of materiality is applicable to the verification of monitored GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals achieved by all types of registered A6.4 projects.\n        However, it is not applicable to:\n        (a)     Uncertainties related to measurement;\n        (b)     Addressing temporary deviations and permanent changes to the registered\n                monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines,\n\n\n\n\n                                                   27 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                regardless of whether corresponding GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                removals are above or below materiality thresholds.\n121.    A DOE that plans and conducts verification using the concept of materiality shall achieve\n        a reasonable level of assurance that the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals are free from material errors, omissions or misstatements in accordance with\n        paragraphs 122−132 below.\n122.    An omission, misstatement, or erroneous reporting of information is material if it might\n        lead, at an aggregated level, to an overestimation of the total GHG emission reductions or\n        net GHG removals achieved by a registered A6.4 project equal to or higher than the\n        following thresholds:\n        (a)     0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total\n                emission reduction or removal equal to or more than 500,000 t CO2 eq per year;19\n        (b)     1 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total\n                emission reduction or removal of between 300,000 and 500,000 t CO2 eq per year;\n        (c)     2 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for projects achieving a total\n                emission reduction or removal of 300,000 t CO2 eq per year or less.\n123.    Recognizing that circumstances may exist that could cause the information reported by\n        activity participants to be materially misstated, the DOE should plan and perform\n        verifications with an attitude of professional scepticism and rely on its professional\n        judgement when applying the concept of materiality.\n124.    The application of the concept of materiality and reasonable level of assurance implies\n        that some data or information may not be checked. However, the DOE should design its\n        verification and sampling plans to detect all material errors, omissions or misstatements,\n        and any unchecked data or information should not contain any material errors, omissions\n        or misstatements. A DOE’s verification opinion applies to 100 per cent of the data and\n        information, even if the DOE may not have checked the entire data set and information.\n125.    Applying the concept of materiality does not mean that identified errors do not need to be\n        corrected; if an error, omission or misstatement is identified by the DOE, regardless of\n        whether it is material or not, the DOE shall request activity participants to address it.\n\n8.1.4.2.        Consideration of materiality in planning verification\n126.    The DOE should:\n        (a)     Identify the materiality threshold referred to in paragraph 122 above that\n                corresponds to the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that\n                the specific registered A6.4 project will achieve;\n        (b)     Understand the environment in which the registered A6.4 project operates, the\n                sources of project emissions within the project boundary and the leakage, the\n                monitoring activities, the equipment used to monitor or measure project data, the\n                origin and application of data used to calculate or measure the emissions, the data\n\n\n\n\n19 A year refers in this paragraph to a period of 12 consecutive months.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   28 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                flow, the internal quality control system, and the overall organization with respect\n                to monitoring and reporting;20\n        (c)     Conduct a risk assessment to identify and assess the risks of individual or\n                aggregated material errors, omissions or misstatements that may occur within the\n                threshold based on elements in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above;\n        (d)     Design verification plans, audit procedures21 and sampling plans whose type,\n                timing22 and extent are based on and are responsive to the assessed risks of\n                material errors, omissions or misstatements.\n127.    The materiality thresholds apply to the total GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals actually achieved. When planning verification, the DOE should apply the\n        applicable materiality threshold to the reported total emission reductions or removals. If,\n        as a result of the verification, the initial reported total emission reductions or removals is\n        revised, the DOE should reapply the materiality threshold to the revised total emission\n        reductions or removals and, if needed, make adjustments to its verification plans and\n        sampling plans.\n\n8.1.4.3.        Consideration of materiality in conducting verification\n128.    The DOE should:\n        (a)     Apply verification plans, audit procedures and sampling plans;\n        (b)     Assess potential errors, omissions and misstatements against the materiality\n                threshold to determine whether they are material individually or in aggregate and\n                whether further audit procedures are needed.\n129.    If an error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE should be aware that it may\n        not be an isolated occurrence and may be a systemic reoccurring error. For example,\n        other errors may exist if the DOE identifies that the error, omission or misstatement arose\n        from a breakdown in the activity participants’ internal quality control and quality assurance\n        system.\n130.    If an immaterial error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall request the\n        activity participants to address it and should determine whether additional audit\n        procedures should be conducted in order to reach a reasonable level of assurance that\n        the claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are free from material error,\n        omission or misstatement.\n131.    If a material error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall, depending on the\n        circumstances of the error, immediately request the activity participants to address it, or\n        conduct additional audit procedures to confirm or determine the context and magnitude of\n        the error, omission or misstatement and then request the activity participants to address\n        it.\n\n\n20 Adapted from European Union. 2007.

If further audit procedures are necessary, the DOE may consider whether the overall\n        verification plans and sampling plans need to be revised.\n\n8.1.5. Standard auditing techniques\n133.    The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants.\n134.

It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at verification for the\n        registered A6.4 project if:\n        (a)     It is the first verification for the DOE with regard to this project;\n        (b)     More than three years have elapsed since the last on-site inspection conducted for\n                verification for the project; or\n        (c)     The project has achieved more than 300,000 t CO2 eq of GHG emission reductions\n                or net GHG removals since the last verification when an on-site inspection was\n                conducted.\n136.    For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 135 above, it is optional for the DOE to\n        conduct an on-site inspection at verification. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site\n        inspection as a means of verification, it shall describe the alternative means used and\n        justify that they are sufficient for the purpose of verification. If the DOE conducts a remote\n        inspection as an alternative means to an on-site inspection, the DOE should follow the\n        guidance contained in Appendix 1.\n137.    If any issue related to the project design, including those attributable to the lack of on-site\n        inspection at previous verification, is identified at the verification, the DOE that detected\n        the issue shall rectify it through the post-registration change process in accordance with\n        the activity cycle procedure.\n138.    Where no specific means of verification is specified, the DOE should apply the standard\n        auditing techniques described in paragraph 134 above.\n\n8.1.6. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests\n139.    If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order\n        to determine whether the implementation or the operation of the registered A6.4 project,\n        or the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals meets the relevant\n        Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues\n        are accurately identified, formulated, discussed and concluded in the verification and\n        certification report.\n140.    The DOE shall raise a CAR if one of the following situations occurs:\n        (a)     Non-compliance with the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies,\n                the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents is found in monitoring and reporting, and has not been sufficiently\n                documented by the activity participants, or if the evidence provided to prove\n                conformity is insufficient;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   31 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     Modifications to the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 project, or\n                the monitoring or GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, has not been\n                sufficiently documented by the activity participants;\n        (c)     Mistakes have been made by the activity participants in applying assumptions,\n                data or calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that may\n                impact the quantity of emission reductions or removals;\n        (d)     Issues identified in a FAR during the validation or the previous verification(s) have\n                not been resolved by the activity participants.\n141.    The DOE shall raise a CL if the information provided by the activity participants is\n        insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism\n        rules and requirements have been met.\n142.    The DOE shall raise a FAR if issues related to monitoring and reporting that require\n        attention and/or adjustment at the next verification are identified.\n143.    The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify\n        the monitoring report, or provide additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s\n        concerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs.\n144.    The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its verification and certification report.\n        This reporting shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity\n        participants, the means of verification of such responses and references to any resulting\n        changes in the monitoring report or its supporting documents.\n\n8.2.    Verification of compliance with specific requirements for issuance\n\n8.2.1. General\n145.    The DOE shall determine, by following the general verification requirements referred to in\n        sections 5 and 8.1 above, whether the monitoring complies with all relevant requirements\n        for monitoring as contained in the activity standard, including the requirements on:\n        (a)     General requirements, including on:\n                (i)     Implementation and operation of the project as per the description in the\n                        registered PDD;\n                (ii)    Continuous monitoring;\n                (iii)   Coverage of the monitoring period;\n                (iv)    Presentation of monitoring results by year of occurrence of GHG emission\n                        reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (v)     Preparation of monitoring reports in chronological order and separation by\n                        crediting periods;\n                (vi)    Application of appropriate GWPs;\n                (vii) Maintenance of monitoring results;\n        (b)     Avoidance of double issuance;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   32 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     Description of implemented registered project;\n        (d)     Description of monitoring system;\n        (e)     Reversal related actions for projects involving removals and emission reduction\n                projects with reversal risks;\n        (f)     Provision of data and parameters used;\n        (g)     Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts;\n        (h)     Calculation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.;\n        (i)     Continuous engagement of stakeholders.\n146.    When verifying the compliance of the implementation and the operation of the registered\n        A6.4 project and monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals with the\n        requirements for implementation, operation and monitoring referred to in paragraph 145\n        above, the DOE shall additionally follow the specific guidance on verification regarding\n        some of these requirements provided in sections 8.2.2−8.2.10 below.\n147.    The DOE shall ensure, before submitting the request for first issuance for the project, that\n        the host Party statement of authorization of the use of A6.4ERs was provided.\n\n8.2.2. Avoidance of double issuance\n148.    The DOE shall determine whether the A6.4 project is also registered, or covered by a\n        programme, under any other international, regional, national, or subnational GHG\n        mitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance based on the confirmation\n        from any other crediting scheme, if applicable, publicly available information and/or the\n        other information obtained from the activity participants.\n149.    If the DOE determines that the A6.4 project is registered, or covered by a programme,\n        under other crediting scheme, the DOE shall additionally determine whether the activity\n        participants have obtained a confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs\n        have not been or will not be credited under the other crediting scheme.\n\n8.2.3. Project implementation and operation\n150.    The DOE shall identify any concerns related to the conformity of the implemented A6.4\n        project and its operation with the registered PDD and determine whether:\n        (a)     The project has been implemented and is operating in accordance with the\n                description contained in the registered PDD; or\n        (b)     Any deviation or the proposed or actual changes in the implementation or operation\n                of the project comply with the relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n151.    By means of an on-site inspection or other means of verification in accordance with\n        paragraphs 135 or 136 above, the DOE shall assess that all physical features (technology,\n        project equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the registered A6.4 project\n        specified in the registered PDD are in place and that the activity participants are operating\n        the project as per the registered PDD or latest approved revised PDD.\n152.    For each monitoring period, the DOE shall report:\n\n\n\n                                                   33 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (a)     The implementation status of the registered A6.4 project. For a project that consists\n                of more than one site, the DOE shall describe the status of implementation and the\n                starting date of operation for each site. For a project with phased implementation,\n                the DOE shall state the progress of the project achieved in each phase under\n                verification. If the phased implementation is delayed, the DOE shall describe the\n                reasons and present the expected implementation dates;\n        (b)     The actual operation of the registered A6.4 project;\n        (c)     The information (data and variables) provided in the monitoring report that is\n                different from that stated in the registered PDD or any latest approved revised\n                PDD, and has caused an increase in the estimates of GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals in the current monitoring period or is highly likely to increase\n                the estimates in future monitoring periods, if appliable;23\n        (d)     An opinion on the cause of any increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project in the current\n                monitoring period that was reported in monitoring report, if applicable.\n153.    For projects that demonstrate additionality through investment analysis for which the PDD\n        was submitted for validation prior to the start date of the project, and for which the\n        investment analysis was not updated through the submission of a request for approval of\n        post-registration changes, the DOE, at the first verification, shall determine whether the\n        investment analysis has been updated based on the data and information for the\n        investment analysis available at the start date of the project in accordance with the\n        relevant provisions of the activity standard and other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents.\n\n8.2.4. Monitoring plan\n154.    The DOE shall determine whether the registered monitoring plan is in accordance with the\n        applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents based on the actual implementation of the project.\n155.    For monitoring aspects that are not specified in the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the\n        DOE should highlight issues which may enhance the level of accuracy and completeness\n        of the registered monitoring plan.\n\n8.2.5. Monitoring activities\n156.    The DOE shall determine whether:\n        (a)     The registered monitoring plan has been properly implemented and followed by\n                the activity participants;\n        (b)     All parameters stated in the registered monitoring plan have been monitored and\n                updated as applicable;\n\n\n\n23 Discrepancies may include higher water availability than expected in the PDD, which may increase the\n\n  electricity output from a hydropower plant, or a higher plant load factor owing to higher bagasse\n  availability during the crushing season, which increases the production of steam and electricity.\n\n\n\n                                                   34 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     The equipment used for monitoring is controlled and calibrated in accordance with\n                the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents,\n                local/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification;\n        (d)     Monitoring results are consistently recorded as per the approved frequency;\n        (e)     Quality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied in accordance\n                with the registered monitoring plan.\n157.    If the activity participants applied a sampling approach to determining data and\n        parameters monitored, the DOE shall assess the compliance of the sampling efforts and\n        surveys with the validated sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and\n        surveys for Article 6.4 mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n158.    The DOE shall list each parameter required by the registered monitoring plan and state\n        how it verified the information flow (from data generation and aggregation, to recording,\n        calculation and reporting) for these parameters including the values in the monitoring\n        report.\n159.    For projects involving removals and emission reduction projects with reversal risks, the\n        DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report includes the following specific\n        elements as per the activity standard and the respective provisions of the removals\n        standard and any applied methodological regulatory documents:\n        (a)     Description of the monitoring activities and methods used;\n        (b)     Estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the\n                monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;\n        (c)     Data collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a\n                summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;\n        (d)     Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could\n                have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions along with a\n                summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period\n                covered by the monitoring report;\n        (e)     Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent\n                with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered PDD;\n        (f)     Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been\n                assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the\n                registered PDD.\n\n8.2.6. Calibration frequency for measuring instruments\n160.    The DOE shall determine whether the calibration of the measuring equipment that has an\n        impact on the claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is conducted by\n        the activity participants at the frequency specified in the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents\n        or the registered monitoring plan.\n161.    If, during the verification for a certain monitoring period, the DOE identifies that the\n        calibration has been delayed and the calibration has been implemented after the\n\n\n\n                                                   35 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n         monitoring period in consideration (i.e. the results of delayed calibration are available),\n         referring to the illustrative examples in Appendix 2, the DOE may conclude its verification,\n         provided the following conservative approach is adopted in the calculation of GHG\n         emission reductions or net GHG removals:\n         (a)    Applying the maximum permissible error24 of the instrument to the measured\n                values taken during the period between the scheduled date of calibration and the\n                actual date of calibration, if the results of the delayed calibration do not show any\n                errors in the measuring equipment, or if the error is smaller than the maximum\n                permissible error; or\n         (b)    Applying the error identified in the delayed calibration test, if the error is beyond\n                the maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment.\n162.     The DOE shall confirm that the error has been applied:\n         (a)    In a conservative manner, such that the adjusted measured values of the delayed\n                calibration shall result in fewer claimed GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                removals;\n         (b)    For all measured values taken during the period between the scheduled date of\n                calibration and the actual date of calibration.\n163.     If the results of the delayed calibration are not available, or the calibration has not been\n         conducted at the time of the verification, the DOE, prior to finalizing the verification, shall\n         request the activity participants to conduct the required calibration and shall determine\n         whether the activity participants have calculated GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n         removals conservatively using the approach mentioned in paragraph 161 above.\n164.     If the DOE determines that it is not possible for the activity participants to conduct the\n         calibration at the frequency specified in the applied methodologies, the applied\n         standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents, or the\n         registered monitoring plan due to reasons beyond the control of the activity participants,25\n         the DOE shall follow the applicable requirements related to post-registration changes in\n         section 7 above.\n165.     If neither the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied\n         methodological regulatory documents, nor the registered monitoring plan specify any\n         requirements for calibration frequency for the measuring equipment, the DOE shall\n         determine whether the equipment is calibrated either in accordance with the specifications\n         of the local/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification. If neither\n         local/national standards nor the manufacturer’s specification are available, the DOE shall\n         determine whether the equipment is calibrated in accordance with the specifications of the\n         international standards.\n\n\n\n\n24 The\n     maximum permissible errors of all the measuring instruments are specified by the respective\n  manufacturers as part of their technical specifications.\n25 For example, due to the contractual terms between the activity participant and purchasing/selling entities.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   36 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n8.2.7. Reversal related actions for projects involving removals and emission reduction\n       projects with reversal risks\n166.    In cases of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that could potentially\n        lead to reversal, the DOE shall determine on the basis of transparent and verifiable\n        evidence whether the event as per the preliminary assessment report, prepared in\n        accordance with the requirements of the activity standard, respective provisions of the\n        removals standard on reversal-related actions and any other relevant applied\n        methodological regulatory documents, results in an actual reversal or not.\n167.    If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the\n        preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual\n        reversal and a monitoring report is prepared, the DOE shall determine whether the\n        monitoring report is in compliance with requirements of the activity standard, respective\n        provisions of the removals standard, and any other relevant applied methodological\n        regulatory documents.\n168.    The DOE shall also assess whether the monitoring report accurately estimates the\n        magnitude of reversals and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable.\n169.    The DOE shall also assess whether, following the submission of the monitoring report:\n        (a)     The risk assessment of the activity has been updated and the risk rating of the\n                activity has been revised;\n        (b)     The compliance with requirements and safeguards contained in the Article 6.4 SD\n                Tool, taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts caused\n                by the reversal and plans developed to prevent the recurrence of such negative\n                environmental and social impacts, has been reviewed.\n\n8.2.8. Data and calculation of emission reductions or net removals\n170.    The DOE shall assess the data and calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals achieved by the registered A6.4 project and determine whether:\n        (a)     A complete set of data for the specified monitoring period is available. If only partial\n                data is available because activity levels or non-activity parameters have not been\n                monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan, the DOE shall assess\n                whether:\n                (i)    The most conservative values approach is applied to the parameters for the\n                       entire non-monitoring period in accordance with the provisions relating to\n                       temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied\n                       methodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard;\n                       or\n                (ii)   Alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-monitoring period are\n                       described, whether they apply conservative assumptions or discount factors\n                       to the calculations, and whether the alterative monitoring arrangements have\n                       been approved by the Supervisory Body under the prior-approval track or to\n                       be approved by the Supervisory Body under the issuance track in\n                       accordance with the provisions relating to temporary deviation from the\n                       registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied\n\n\n\n\n                                                   37 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                       standardized baselines in the activity standard and the activity cycle\n                       procedure;\n        (b)     The information provided in the monitoring report has been cross-checked with\n                other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase records and\n                laboratory analysis;\n        (c)     The calculations of baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals,\n                project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals, and leakage GHG emissions\n                have been carried out in accordance with the formulae and methods described in\n                the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents;\n        (d)     Where projects involving removals also result in emission reductions, the\n                accounting of removals and emission reductions has been separated in the\n                monitoring report in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity;\n        (e)     Any assumptions used in emission or removal calculations have been justified;\n        (f)     Appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values, GWPs and other reference\n                values have been correctly applied;\n        (g)     If the project applies an approved standardized baseline that standardizes baseline\n                emissions, the standardized values of the parameters have been applied using the\n                correct version of the applied standardized baseline in accordance with the activity\n                standard.\n171.    The DOE shall provide:\n        (a)     An indication of whether a complete set of data for the monitoring period was not\n                available because activity levels or non-activity parameters were not monitored in\n                accordance with the registered monitoring plan, and if so, whether the most\n                conservative values approach was applied or alternative monitoring arrangements\n                were proposed or have been approved by the Supervisory Body;\n        (b)     A description of how the DOE cross-checked reported data;\n        (c)     A confirmation that appropriate methods and formulae for calculating baseline\n                GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals, project GHG emissions or actual\n                net GHG removals and leakage GHG emissions have been followed;\n        (d)     An opinion on whether assumptions, emission factors and default values that were\n                applied in the calculations have been justified.\n\n8.2.9. Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts\n172.    The DOE shall verify the appropriateness, relevance and sufficiency of information\n        provided in the monitoring of the environmental and social indicators in the A6.4\n        Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators\n        in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, as reported in a monitoring report.\n173.    If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in the A6.4 Environmental and\n        social management plan form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form that\n        were validated at registration, it shall provide its opinion to the activity participants on the\n\n\n\n                                                   38 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and\n        environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in the A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form\n        and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form.\n174.    The DOE shall review any input and comments received via the continuous engagement\n        of local stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, conduct interviews with local\n        stakeholders and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post fulfilment\n        of risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity.\n175.    The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and\n        reported parameters established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form submitted at the registration\n        stage.\n176.    For projects that successfully transitioned from the clean development mechanism (CDM)\n        and that prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits description report” in\n        accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool” at the time of transition,\n        the DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report includes the outcome of the\n        monitoring of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on the\n        document describing how the activity participant monitors sustainable development co-\n        benefits of the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring results, in\n        accordance with relevant provisions of the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the\n        Article 6.4 mechanism”.\n\n8.2.10. Continuous engagement of stakeholders\n177.    If the activity participants have received comments on the implementation or operation of\n        the A6.4 project from local stakeholders after its registration through the process of\n        continuous engagement of stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE\n        shall determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the\n        comments in the implementation or operation of the project, as appropriate.\n178.    The DOE shall also determine whether comments on the compliance of the registered\n        A6.4 project with applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and regulations have been\n        submitted from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer organizations and\n        published on the UNFCCC website in accordance with the activity cycle procedure, and if\n        so, determine whether the activity participants have addressed the issues raised in the\n        comments.\n\n8.3.    Verification and certification report\n179.    The DOE shall report the results of its assessment in the verification and certification\n        report, including:\n        (a)     An executive summary of the verification process and its conclusions;\n        (b)     Details of the verification team, technical experts, internal reviewers involved,\n                together with their roles in the verification activity and, where conducted in\n                accordance with paragraph 135 or 136 above, details of who conducted the on-\n                site inspection;\n        (c)     A list of interviewees, documents reviewed, sampling approaches used by the DOE\n                and, where conducted in accordance with paragraph 135 or 136 above, an outline\n\n\n\n                                                   39 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                of the on-site inspection. If the DOE applied a sampling approach to the on-site\n                inspection, the DOE shall include a description of how the sample size was\n                determined and how the field check was carried out;\n        (d)     Results of the dialogue between the DOE and the activity participants, as well as\n                any adjustments made to the monitoring report following the continuous\n                engagement of stakeholders;\n        (e)     The applied approach, finding and conclusion in the assessment of compliance\n                with each requirement for issuance conducted in accordance with sections 8.1‒8.2\n                above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the activity participants and how\n                they have been addressed by them;\n        (f)     A list of each parameter specified by the registered monitoring plan and a\n                statement on how the values in the monitoring report have been verified;\n        (g)     A statement on whether any post-registration changes to the registered PDD have\n                been approved by the Supervisory Body or will be submitted together with the\n                request for issuance of A6.4ERs;\n        (h)     An assessment of remaining issues from the previous verification period, if\n                appropriate;\n        (i)     Information on quality control within the team and in the verification process;\n        (j)     A verification opinion, providing:\n                (i)    A summary of the verification method and the process used and the\n                       verification criteria applied;\n                (ii)   A conclusion on the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                       removals achieved.\n180.    Where the DOE applied the concept of materiality in planning and conducting verification\n        for the registered A6.4 project in accordance with section 8.1.4 above, it shall report:\n        (a)     The risks, the risk assessment undertaken and how the verification plans and\n                sampling plans were designed to respond to these risks and ensure that all material\n                errors, omissions or misstatements were detected;\n        (b)     Whether and how the verification plans and sampling plans were revised to take\n                into account the need for further audit procedures due to the nature/type of errors,\n                omissions or misstatements detected;\n        (c)     How the concept of materiality was applied in determining whether a detected\n                error, omission or misstatement was material or immaterial either individually or in\n                aggregate.\n181.    The DOE shall describe all documentation supporting the verification and make it available\n        on request.\n182.    The DOE shall, based on its verification, certify in writing, that the registered A6.4 project\n        achieved the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net anthropogenic GHG\n\n\n\n\n                                                   40 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        removals during the specified monitoring period that would not have occurred in the\n        absence of the project.26\n183.    If the DOE identifies unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the parameters\n        established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4\n        Sustainable development impact form and cannot be remediated by consultation or\n        mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion or submit a deviation request\n        to the Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance.\n184.    The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the verification outcome, which will be one\n        of the following options:\n        (a)     A positive verification opinion with verified amount of GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals, and the date of submission of the verification and certification\n                report as part of the request for issuance of A6.4ERs to the secretariat; or\n        (b)     A negative verification opinion, including the reasons for the monitoring results, as\n                documented, having been determined as not complying with the relevant\n                requirements for issuance.\n\n9.      Validation for renewal of crediting period\n9.1.    General requirements\n\n9.1.1. Overarching requirement\n185.    The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have updated the PDD in\n        accordance with the relevant requirements for renewal of the crediting period in the activity\n        standard.\n\n9.1.2. Other requirements\n186.    If the activity participants used a later valid version of the PDD form for the updated PDD\n        than the version of the form of the registered PDD, the DOE shall determine whether the\n        information transferred to the later valid version of the PDD form is materially the same as\n        that in the registered PDD.\n\n9.2.    Validation of compliance with specific requirements for renewal\n\n9.2.1. General\n187.    The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in\n        sections 5 and 6.1 above mutatis mutandis and section 9.1 above, whether the proposed\n        renewal of the crediting period of a registered A6.4 project complies with all relevant\n        requirements for renewal contained in the activity standard, including the requirements on:\n        (a)     Application of valid version of the methodologies and methodological tools;\n        (b)     Application of an approved standardized baseline;\n\n\n\n26 The certification report constitutes a request to the Supervisory Body for issuance of A6.4ERs equal to\n\n  the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.\n\n\n\n                                                   41 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     Validity of the original baseline or its update;\n        (d)     Update of the BAU scenario and emissions, the baseline scenario and emissions,\n                and the difference between the baseline and BAU emissions;\n        (e)     Update of the downwards adjustment;\n        (f)     Update of the regulatory analysis for the additionality;\n        (g)     Update of the estimated GHG emissions and net GHG removals (if applicable);\n        (h)     Update of the monitoring plan (if applicable);\n        (i)     Update of the A6.4 SD Tool forms;\n        (j)     Updated risk assessment and monitoring plan for projects involving removals and\n                emission reduction projects with reversal risks;\n        (k)     Update of the crediting period;\n        (l)     Update of MoC statement;\n        (m)     Combination of post-registration change at renewal, if applicable.\n\n9.2.2. Application of valid version of the methodologies and methodological tools\n188.    If the activity participants selected another methodology, methodological tool and/or\n        standardized baseline for the purpose of renewal of the crediting period of the registered\n        A6.4 project due to the inapplicability of the valid version of the methodology (including a\n        consolidated methodology thereof), methodological tool and/or standardized baseline\n        applied to the registered PDD, the DOE shall assess whether the updated PDD complies\n        with all the requirements of the selected methodology, methodological tool and/or\n        standardized baseline.\n189.    If the activity participants deviated from the valid version of the methodology (including a\n        consolidated methodology thereof) and/or methodological tool applied in the registered\n        PDD, or from any other selected methodology and/or methodological tool for the purpose\n        of renewal of the crediting period of the registered A6.4 project, paragraphs 42‒43 above\n        shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\n9.2.3. Validity of original baseline or its update\n190.    The DOE shall assess the validity of the original baseline or its update through an\n        assessment of the correctness of the application of the approved methodologies and,\n        where applicable, the approved standardized baselines and the other methodological\n        regulatory documents for the determination of the continued validity of the baseline or its\n        update, and the estimation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the\n        applicable crediting period of the registered A6.4 project.\n\n9.2.4. Update of modalities of communication statement\n191.    The DOE shall confirm that the names of the activity participants included in the updated\n        PDD are consistent with the names of the activity participants in the latest version of the\n        MoC statement.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   42 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n9.2.5. Combination of post-registration change at renewal\n192.    If the activity participants requested approval of post-registration changes together with\n        the request for renewal of the crediting period of the registered A6.4 project, the DOE shall\n        also validate the post-registration changes in accordance with the relevant requirements\n        in section 7 above and the activity cycle procedure, and shall submit a request for approval\n        of post-registration changes together with the request for renewal of the crediting period\n        of the project in accordance with the relevant requirements in the activity cycle procedure.\n\n9.3.    Validation report\n193.    In its validation report for the renewal of the crediting period, the DOE shall:\n        (a)     Report on all items listed in paragraph 82 above except for subparagraph 82(e);\n        (b)     Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusions on the assessment of:\n                (i)    Whether the revised PDD was prepared using the valid version of the\n                       applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable;\n                (ii)   The compliance of the updated project design with the requirements for\n                       renewal of the crediting period conducted in accordance with sections 9.1‒\n                       9.2 above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the activity\n                       participants and how they have been addressed by them;\n        (c)     State whether there are any proposed post-registration changes effective from the\n                start date of the next crediting period in the request for renewal of the crediting\n                period of the project, if the validation is primarily for the latter.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   43 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. Guidance on remote inspection as                                                       an\n            alternative means to an on-site inspection\n\n1.      In this document, a remote inspection for the purpose of validation or verification refers to\n        the activities where the validation or verification team of the designated operational entity\n        (DOE) carries out the same activities as in a physical on-site inspection through\n        information and communication technologies (ICT) tools.\n2.      There are risks posed by remote inspections, including in the use of ICT tools. In order to\n        ensure a level of assurance of the validation or verification as comparable as in an on-site\n        inspection, there needs to be measures in place to reduce these risks.\n3.      The DOE should identify risks pertaining to the remote inspection for each validation or\n        verification activity and establish and implement measures to eliminate or reduce those\n        risks. A DOE should also integrate this risk assessment process into its quality\n        management systems.\n4.      The DOE should implement the following actions at different stages of a validation or\n        verification activity:\n        (a)     Risk assessment stage: The feasibility of conducting a remote inspection depends\n                on the risk level and whether measures to eliminate or reduce the risks are\n                adequate for the validation or verification. Therefore, a risk assessment to be\n                conducted by the DOE should cover the aspects below:\n                (i)    Identifying and assessing the risks inherent in a remote inspection. The risks\n                       may be at different levels and could cover different aspects; hence the risk\n                       identification and assessment should cover:\n                         a.     Risks related to organizational and procedural aspects, which include\n                                generic risks. These risks could relate to the following: the quality of\n                                the internet connection; the quality of ICT tools such as good\n                                camerawork to ensure a reasonably good view for the validation or\n                                verification team; the amount of documentation to be reviewed\n                                remotely; whether relevant data flows can be accessed remotely;\n                                what record-keeping system is established; the maintaining of\n                                confidentiality and personnel data protection; and the required\n                                competence and resources of the validation or verification team;\n                         b.     Risks related to the project and its configuration, which present\n                                project-specific risks: The risks could relate to the following: whether\n                                the boundary and features of the project can be evaluated remotely;\n                                whether the remote inspection would enable the DOE to observe any\n                                sources of emissions that are not included in the project; how control\n                                activities are carried out; and how calculations are tracked and cross-\n                                checked;\n                         c.     Risks related to monitoring aspects: The risks could relate to the\n                                following: the complexity of the monitoring parameters and the\n                                monitoring plan; data processing and reporting; whether a fiscal\n                                metering method is applied; the sampling or surveys conducted at\n                                household level; what status of the monitoring period is being\n\n                                                   44 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                                verified; and whether data and information have been thoroughly\n                                checked during previous verifications or whether such data and\n                                information can be checked subsequently without an on-site\n                                inspection;\n                (ii)    Establishing measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. The DOE\n                        should establish measures to eliminate or reduce each identified risk at\n                        different levels described in subparagraph (i) above;\n                (iii)   The risk assessment pertaining to the remote inspection may be done in the\n                        context of the application of materiality following the relevant provisions in\n                        this standard;\n        (b)     Planning stage: Based on risk assessment outcomes, the DOE should plan the\n                validation or verification activity as follows:\n                (i)     Composing a validation or verification team with sufficient members that\n                        have the knowledge, skill and solid professional judgement required in an\n                        on-site inspection in conjunction with additional competence in applying ICT\n                        tools;\n                (ii)    Conducting a desk review to gain a prior understanding of records and\n                        documentation control processes of the project participants;\n                (iii)   Establishing a validation or verification plan to clearly define the tasks to be\n                        done during the remote inspection, taking into account the established\n                        measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. This includes a detailed\n                        allocation of responsibilities by different validation or verification team\n                        members with the required knowledge and specific time zones to ensure the\n                        team members audit separately and make the best use of time;\n                (iv)    Determining ICT tools to be used with the activity participants and conducting\n                        a test on the agreed ICT tools before the remote inspection to ensure that\n                        there is a stable connection and understanding of how to use such ICT tools.\n                        The DOE should also ensure that there is a backup plan in case there is a\n                        connection issue;\n        (c)     Implementation stage: During the remote inspection, the DOE should implement\n                measures it has established to mitigate the identified risks, while conducting the\n                validation or verification following the relevant requirements of this standard. At this\n                stage, the DOE may decide to extend or terminate the remote inspection if it finds\n                during the remote inspection that the actual risks are higher than initially assessed.\n        (d)     Post-remote inspection stage: the DOE should:\n                (i)     Assess whether another round of remote inspection is needed while\n                        reviewing the activity participants’ responses to clarification requests,\n                        corrective action requests and/or forward action requests;\n                (ii)    Ensure that its technical review process is able to identify any risks that were\n                        not identified during the risk assessment stage.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   45 of 47\nA6.4-STAN-AC-003\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for projects\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2. Calibration\n\n1.      The following provides an illustrative example for applying the provisions in paragraph\n        161(a) and (b) of this standard.\n2.      An electricity energy meter with a maximum permissible error (±5%), which may be used\n        for measuring the electricity export for baseline emissions and electricity import for project\n        emission calculations, is required to be calibrated every year. If the calibration is delayed\n        and instead of after one year it is conducted after one and a half years, and the result of\n        the delayed calibration is available at the time of verification, to account for the delayed\n        calibration the measured values shall be corrected as demonstrated in the following\n        Table 1 and Table 2 for situations stipulated in paragraph 161(a) and (b) of this standard.\n\n        Table 1.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The Supervisory Body, at its thirteenth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 activity standard\n          for programme of activities” (hereinafter referred to as this standard) that set out the\n          requirements relating to the design, implementation and other attributes of Article 6.4\n          mechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and of component projects (CPs).\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the\n          requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of\n          Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies\n          standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article\n          6.4 mechanism” (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article\n          6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two\n          standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4\n          mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and\n          emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas\n          the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have\n          met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental\n          risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to\n          sustainable development in line with the sustainable development objectives and priorities\n          of the host Party and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n1.2.      Objectives\n5.        The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to the design,\n          implementation and other attributes of A6.4 PoAs and of CPs that may be included in\n          registered A6.4 PoAs.\n\n\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

The generic CP-DD shall:\n        (a)     Describe the technologies/measures to be deployed and/or implemented by the\n                corresponding CPs, including a description of their common features;\n        (b)     Define the conditions and circumstances under which technologies/measures may\n                be included as CPs in the PoA by establishing eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs\n                in the PoA;\n        (c)     Specify how the corresponding CPs are to be designed to ensure that they comply\n                with all applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, including the\n\n\n\n                                                  11 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                 requirements in this standard and in the applied methodologies and, where\n                 applicable, the applied standardized baselines.\n37.      For a proposed A6.4 PoA applying more than one technology/measure or more than one\n         methodology, the activity participants shall prepare a generic CP-DD for each\n         technology/measure, each methodology and each combination thereof.8\n38.      The activity participants shall consider any specific guidance in the applied methodologies\n         regarding the requirement to prepare a separate generic CP-DD for each\n         technology/measure, taking into account differences in the means of demonstration of\n         additionality, GHG emission reductions or net GHG removal calculations, and monitoring\n         methods applicable to the technologies/measures being implemented.\n\n6.12.2. General description\n39.      The activity participants shall describe the generic CP in the generic CP-DD. When\n         describing the generic CP, the activity participants shall provide, inter alia, the following\n         information:\n         (a)     The purpose of the generic CP;\n         (b)     The confirmation that the generic CP is within the types of A6.4 activities that the\n                 host Party indicated that it would approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of\n                 the RMPs;\n         (c)     The geographical boundary;\n         (d)     The technologies/measures to be deployed and/or implemented by the\n                 corresponding CPs, including:\n                 (i)     A list of the facilities, systems and equipment that will be installed and/or\n                         modified by the corresponding CPs;\n                 (ii)    The types and levels of services9 provided by the facilities, systems and\n                         equipment and their relation, if any, to other facilities, systems and equipment\n                         outside the project boundary;\n                 (iii)   The arrangement of the facilities, systems and equipment;\n                 (iv)    The range of the age and average lifetime of the facilities, systems and\n                         equipment based on the manufacturer’s specifications and industry\n                         standards;\n                 (v)     The range of the installed capacities, load factors and efficiencies;\n\n\n\n8   For instance, a PoA for energy-efficiency activities applying a single methodology but including different\n    technologies will need more than one generic CP-DD (e.g. a generic CP-DD for efficient street lighting\n    and a generic CP-DD for efficient water pumping). However, separate generic CP-DDs are not required\n    to cover cases that do not differ in terms of GHG emission reduction calculations (e.g. separate generic\n    CP-DDs are not required for installing cookstoves of efficiency N by manufacturer M1 versus installing\n    prefabricated cookstoves of efficiency N by manufacturer M2).\n9   Examples of “types and levels of services” include the amount of a certain type of cement produced or\n    the amount of electricity fed into the electricity grid.\n\n\n\n                                                   12 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                (vi)   The energy and mass flows and balances of the facilities, systems and\n                       equipment, if necessary;\n                (vii) The monitoring equipment and their location in the systems;\n         (e)    The technologies/measures existing prior to the implementation of the\n                corresponding CPs at the same sites, as applicable, including the equivalent\n                information listed in subparagraph (d) above on the facilities, systems and\n                equipment;\n         (f)    A summary of the baseline scenario as established in accordance with 6.12.6\n                below, including the equivalent information listed in subparagraph (d) above.\n         (g)    An indication for each generic CP as to how the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool\n                will be applied at CP level and how the analysis of the environmental and social\n                impacts and sustainable development impacts will be conducted at the CP level in\n                accordance with the requirements of the A6.4 SD Tool, and how the environmental,\n                social and sustainable development impacts will be monitored.\n\n6.12.3. Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines\n40.      The activity participants shall select methodologies that have been approved by the\n         Supervisory Body and that are valid,10 applicable to the generic CP and, if applicable,\n         compatible with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party\n         in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs.\n41.      In selecting a methodology for the generic CP, the activity participants may:\n         (a)    Propose a new methodology in accordance with the “Procedure: Development,\n                revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”;\n         (b)    Propose a revision to an approved methodology or methodological tool in\n                accordance with the procedure referred to in subparagraph 41(a) above;\n         (c)    Seek clarification on the applicability of an approved methodology or\n                methodological tool in accordance with the procedure referred to in subparagraph\n                41(a) above; or\n         (d)    Request clarification of acceptability of deviation from an approved methodology\n                or methodological tool in accordance with the procedure referred to in\n                subparagraph 41(a) above.\n\n6.12.4. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n42.      The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC\n         reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized\n         baselines that are applied to the generic CP, including any other methodologies or\n         methodological tools to which the selected methodologies refer.\n\n\n\n10 The  valid version of a mechanism methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the\n  submission of the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA to the secretariat in accordance with\n  the activity cycle procedure is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance\n  with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.\n\n\n\n                                                  13 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n43.     The activity participants shall demonstrate why the selected methodologies, standardized\n        baselines, and any other standards, methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines\n        applied in accordance with the selected methodologies (hereinafter “any other standards,\n        methodologies, methodological tools and guidelines (to be) applied in accordance with the\n        selected (applied) methodologies” are collectively referred to as the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents) are applicable to the generic CP by showing that\n        the generic CP meets all applicability conditions of these regulatory documents and, if\n        applicable, are compatible with the methodological requirements that may be specified by\n        the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs.\n44.     The activity participants shall ensure that the design of the generic CP complies with all\n        the requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and\n        the other applied methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the\n        methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with\n        paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs.\n45.     The activity participants may apply combinations of multiple methodologies for the\n        proposed A6.4 PoA using one of the options below if the generic CPs apply a combination\n        of technologies/measures that are not covered by a single methodology:\n        (a)     The same combination of technologies/measures under the same combination of\n                methodologies are applied consistently in every CP in the PoA;\n        (b)     A principal technology/measure is used consistently in all CPs in the PoA, applying\n                different combinations of methodologies to different CPs; or\n        (c)     Combinations of technologies/measures and/or methodologies vary across CPs in\n                the PoA and the implementation of activities through CPs is integrated through the\n                design of the PoA.11\n46.     In any of the options referred to in paragraph 45 above, the activity participants shall either:\n        (a)     Demonstrate that no cross-effects exist between the technologies/measures by\n                following the instructions provided in Appendix 3; or\n        (b)     If cross-effects exist, take them into account in the calculation of GHG emission\n                reductions.\n47.     For the purpose of meeting the requirement referred to in paragraph 46 above, the activity\n        participants may:\n        (a)     Seek clarification from the Supervisory Body on the existence of cross-effects or\n                how they should be taken into account in the calculation of GHG emission\n                reductions in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and\n                clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”; or\n        (b)     Propose a revision to the applied methodologies in accordance with the procedure\n                referred to in subparagraph (a) above to take into account the identified cross\n                effects.\n\n11 For example, the PoA involves different GHG emission reduction activities as part of a city-wide effort\n\n  that includes different measures such as energy production, transport, energy efficiency and waste\n  management, or the PoA involves the installation of renewable electricity systems, which may include\n  grid-connected and off-grid systems, by providing financial incentives for the installation of these\n  systems.\n\n\n\n                                                  14 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n6.12.5. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases\n48.     The activity participants shall describe how to define the project boundary of each of the\n        corresponding CPs, including the physical delineation of the project using Global\n        Positioning System (GPS) coordinates as appropriate, and which sources, sinks and\n        GHGs are included in the project boundary in accordance with the applied methodologies\n        and the applied standardized baselines. In this context, project boundary is a physical\n        delineation or geographical area that encompasses GHGs and sources under the control\n        of the activity participants and that are significant and reasonably attributable to the\n        corresponding CP in accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable,\n        the applied standardized baselines.\n49.     If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity\n        participants to choose whether a source, sink or GHG is to be included in the project\n        boundary, the activity participants shall explain and justify the choice.\n\n6.12.6. Baseline scenario\n50.     The activity participants shall describe how to establish the baseline scenario for each of\n        the corresponding CPs in accordance with the applied methodologies, standardized\n        baselines, other applied methodological regulatory documents, the provisions in\n        paragraph 51 below and/or a more ambitious baseline requirement determined by the host\n        Party and approved by the Supervisory Body and, where applicable, the baseline\n        approaches specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs.\n51.     When describing how to establish the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee\n        that future emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to the\n        specific circumstances of the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed\n        demand in the applied methodology or propose a revision to an approved methodology to\n        cover such scenario if it is not covered in the methodology.\n52.     If the generic CP applies an approved standardized baseline that standardizes the\n        baseline scenario, the activity participants shall describe the baseline scenario as per the\n        applied standardized baseline.\n\n6.12.7. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark\n53.     The activity participants shall describe how to identify the business-as-usual (BAU)\n        scenario or reference benchmark emissions in the generic CP-DD in accordance with the\n        applied methodologies or other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n6.12.8. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals\n54.     The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex post calculation of\n        baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as the modalities\n        for estimating the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by each\n        of the corresponding CPs in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines and other applied methodological regulatory documents. If the\n        generic CP contains more than one component or applies more than one methodology,\n        the activity participants shall apply this requirement for each component and/or\n        methodology separately. The activity participants shall describe all steps to be undertaken\n        for these calculations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n55.     For generic CPs developed for activities involving removals that also result in emission\n        reductions, the estimation of removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the\n        generic CP-DD in accordance with the methodology(ies) applicable to the generic CP.\n56.     The activity participants shall describe in the generic CP-DD the steps to calculate the\n        difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the crediting\n        period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward adjustment\n        based on BAU.\n57.     The activity participants shall describe in the generic CP-DD how to determine whether\n        the baseline must be adjusted downward as per the guidance below:\n        (a)     The activity participants shall describe in the generic CP-DD how to identify the\n                factors and quantitative methods for downward adjustment and update them at\n                each renewal of the crediting period, in accordance with paragraphs 57(b) and\n                57(c) below. Activity participants shall also describe how more stringent factors or\n                quantitative methods determined by the host Parties for downward adjustment,\n                according to their circumstances, are applied;\n        (b)     The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers the\n                economic viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and\n                decarbonization technologies, and negative emission approaches while ensuring\n                that methodologies are aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris\n                Agreement, and may be operationalized through:\n                (i)     Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies\n                        approved by the Supervisory Body that may be proposed by activity\n                        participants or stakeholders;12\n                (ii)    Factors or quantitative methods jointly developed by the Supervisory Body\n                        and the host Party;\n                (iii)   Factors or quantitative methods developed by the host Party that are\n                        specified to the Supervisory Body for approval;\n        (c)     If the downward adjustment based on the BAU referred to in paragraph 56 above\n                is greater than the downward adjustment determined based on paragraph 57(b)\n                above, no further adjustment to the baseline is required to be made in the\n                corresponding CP-DD; otherwise the generic CP-DD shall require further\n                adjustment to align with the result of paragraphs 57(a) and 57(b) above to ensure\n                consistency with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMPs, in accordance\n                with other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n58.     The activity participants shall describe how to determine leakage emissions in the generic\n        CP-DD through:\n        (a)     Identifying all potential sources of leakage that may reasonably be attributable to\n                corresponding CPs following the applicable methodology and other applied\n\n\n12 Activity participants or stakeholders may propose factors or quantitative methods for the consideration\n\n  of the Supervisory Body in consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being\n  involved. If a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the procedures for the\n  standardized baselines shall be applied. See here https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-\n  PROC-METH-002.pdf\n\n\n\n                                                  16 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                methodological regulatory documents. If any of the sources of leakage is excluded\n                from consideration, proper justification shall be provided in the generic CP-DD;\n        (b)     Identifying how each of the sources of leakage above will be avoided or minimized\n                following the applicable methodology and other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents;\n        (c)     Justifying how information from the designated national authority (DNA) of the host\n                Party on leakage will be taken into account as per the application of other applied\n                methodological regulatory documents.\n59.     If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide\n        different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify\n        their choice.\n60.     The activity participants shall use the valid version of the norms, specifications, standards\n        and test procedures referred to in the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, as available at the\n        time of submission of the PoA-DD to a DOE for validation.\n61.     The activity participants shall, in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents,\n        provide identification of the data and parameters that will not be monitored but will be\n        determined before the CP inclusion in the proposed A6.4 PoA individually for each CP and\n        remain fixed throughout the crediting period of the CP.\n62.     The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation\n        of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the corresponding CPs results in\n        conservative estimates.\n63.     The activity participants may use sampling for the determination of parameter values for\n        calculating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals if the applied methodologies,\n        the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents allow this. In such cases, the activity participants shall develop and describe a\n        sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for Article 6.4\n        mechanism activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n\n6.12.9. Monitoring plan\n64.     The activity participants shall describe how to develop a monitoring plan for each of the\n        corresponding CPs in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, all\n        other applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, and the provisions in\n        paragraphs 66−69 below.\n65.     For generic CP-DDs developed for CPs involving removals, activity participants shall\n        describe how it is ensured that monitoring of removals will be carried out based on data\n        derived from measurements, sampling, remote-sensing, third-party sources and published\n        literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and take appropriate\n        account of the associated uncertainties.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n66.     The monitoring shall meet the following requirements, unless the applied methodologies,\n        the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents state otherwise:\n        (a)     Data variables that impact the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                continuously (e.g. quantity of fuel inputs, amount of heat or electricity produced,\n                gas captured) shall be measured continuously and recorded at appropriate\n                intervals;\n        (b)     Measuring equipment shall be certified to national or International Electrotechnical\n                Commission (IEC) standards;\n        (c)     The calibration of measuring equipment shall be carried out by an accredited\n                person or institution;\n        (d)     Measured data with high levels of uncertainty shall be compared with data from\n                other sources to check the consistency.\n67.

The definition of assets in this context excludes\n                land;\n        (d)     Output: the amount of goods or services produced by a technology;\n        (e)     Resource: a source of supply or support needed for the production of an output. It\n                may include categories of goods, energy and energy carriers that are supplied into\n                the project location and are required for the implementation of the CP, such as\n                fossil fuel, by-product of a process, biomass, solar, wind, or geothermal heat.\n86.     If the CP involves the implementation of distributed units in households and the conditions\n        referred to in paragraph 84 above are not met, the activity participants shall request a DOE\n        to validate and confirm by other means that the CP will not lead to the discontinuation or\n\n\n                                                  24 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        modification of the former project, and does not decrease the GHG emission reductions\n        or net GHG removals by the former project, in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation\n        and verification standard for programmes of activities” (hereinafter referred to as the\n        validation and verification standard).\n87.     In all other cases, the activity participants may submit a communication to the Supervisory\n        Body to request clarification prior to the inclusion of the CP in the registered PoA.\n\n7.4.    Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines\n88.     The activity participants shall select methodologies for the CP in accordance with the\n        generic CP. If a methodology applied to the generic CP has been revised by the\n        Supervisory Body, the validity of the version of the methodology and the necessity of post-\n        registration change to the registered A6.4 PoA to apply the new version of the\n        methodology prior to the inclusion of the CP shall follow the corresponding rules for validity\n        of methodology contained in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of\n        methodologies and methodological tools”.\n89.     If an applicable standardized baseline is available for the CP, the mandatory or optional\n        selection of the standardized baseline shall be in accordance with the generic CP. If the\n        generic CP does not refer to the selection of a standardized baseline but an applicable\n        standardized baseline is available at the time of the inclusion of the CP in the registered\n        A6.4 PoA, the activity participants shall or may select the standardized baseline depending\n        on the mandatory19 or optional conditions for its selection, provided that the development\n        of the standardized baseline is consistent with the approach to setting a baseline\n        described in the generic CP.\n\n7.5.    Application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n\n7.5.1. General requirements\n90.     The activity participants shall provide the references (titles, versions and UNFCCC\n        reference numbers) of the selected methodologies and the selected standardized\n        baselines that are applied to the CP, including any other methodologies or methodological\n        tools to which the selected methodologies refer, in accordance with the generic CP.\n91.     The activity participants shall demonstrate that the CP meets all conditions of the eligibility\n        criteria referred to in paragraph 72(h) above that ensure compliance with the applicability\n        of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents and, if applicable, the methodological requirements\n        that may be specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs.\n\n7.5.2. Project boundary, sources, sinks and greenhouse gases\n92.     The activity participants shall describe the project boundary of the CP, including the\n        physical delineation of the CP using GPS coordinates as appropriate, and which sources,\n        sinks and GHGs are included in the project boundary in accordance with the applied\n\n\n19 As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to revise the PoA-DD in\n\n  order to apply a mandatory standardized baseline that becomes available after the registration of the\n  PoA and before a renewal of the PoA period. However, the activity cycle procedure also specifies that\n  no new CPs can be included in the PoA until a post-registration change to the PoA to reflect the\n  requirements of the standardized baseline is approved by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n                                                  25 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        methodologies and the applied standardized baselines, in accordance with the modalities\n        in the generic CP as per paragraph 48 above. In this context, the project boundary is a\n        physical delineation or geographical area that encompasses GHGs and sources under the\n        control of the activity participants and that are significant and reasonably attributable to\n        the CP in accordance with the applied methodologies and, where applicable, the applied\n        standardized baselines.\n\n7.5.3. Baseline scenario\n93.     The activity participants shall establish and describe the baseline scenario for the CP in\n        accordance with the modalities in the generic CP as per paragraph 50 above.\n94.     The activity participants shall provide information on the facilities, systems and equipment\n        to be operated under the CP and in the baseline scenario.\n95.     When establishing the baseline scenario, if the activity participants foresee that future\n        emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels due to the specific\n        circumstances of the host Party, they may follow the guidance on suppressed demand in\n        the applied methodology if such option is envisaged in the generic CP in accordance with\n        paragraph 51 above.\n96.     In case of replacement of existing equipment, the activity participants shall estimate the\n        point in time when the existing equipment would be replaced in the absence of the CP in\n        accordance with the guidance on determining the remaining lifetime of equipment in the\n        applied methodology if applicable.\n97.     If the CP is registered under or covered by another international, regional, national,\n        subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme, the activity participants shall\n        apply the most conservative baseline scenario between that which is required by the\n        applied methodology and that which is set under such other crediting scheme in\n        accordance with guidance to be provided by the Supervisory Body.\n98.     Notwithstanding paragraphs 93−97 above, if the CP applies an approved standardized\n        baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the activity participants shall describe\n        the baseline scenario as per the applied standardized baseline.\n\n7.5.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark\n99.     The activity participants shall describe the BAU scenario or reference benchmark\n        emissions for the proposed CP in accordance with the modalities of the generic CP-DD.\n\n7.5.5. Demonstration of additionality\n100.    The activity participants shall demonstrate that the CP meets all conditions of the eligibility\n        criteria referred to in paragraph 72(i) above that ensure that the CP meets the\n        requirements for demonstration of additionality in compliance with the provisions of\n        applied methodologies, methodological tools and/or standardized baselines.\n\n7.5.6. Addressing non-permanence for component projects involving removals and\n       emission reduction component projects with reversal risks\n101.    For CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the activity\n        participants shall, as per the modalities for inclusion of a CP in the A6.4 PoA, identify and\n        assess the risks of reversals in the CP-DD, aligned with the provisions of the removals\n\n\n\n                                                  26 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents approved by the\n        Supervisory Body, and conduct the risk assessment in accordance with the applied\n        methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n102.    The risks of reversals may be related, inter alia, to:\n        (a)     Activity finance and management, asset ownership, and rising opportunity costs;\n        (b)     Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,\n                acts of terrorism, crime and war;\n        (c)     Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, droughts,\n                hurricanes, floods, landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and geological\n                faults and fractures;\n        (d)     Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks.\n103.    The risk assessment shall include:\n        (a)     A risk mitigation plan using the reversal risk assessment tool to be developed by\n                the Supervisory Body to identify, assess and mitigate reversal risks; and\n        (b)     The calculation of an overall percentage-based risk rating (hereinafter referred to\n                as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals, taking\n                into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood and duration of the risks.\n104.    The risk assessment shall be reviewed and revised by activity participants every five years\n        from the start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances referred to in\n        paragraph 115 below.\n\n7.5.7. Estimation of emission reductions or net removals\n105.    The activity participants shall describe how they will undertake the ex post calculation of\n        baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as well as GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by the CP, and provide the ex-ante\n        calculation of them for each year of the crediting period, in accordance with the modalities\n        in the generic CP as per paragraphs 54–58 above. If the CP contains more than one\n        component, the activity participants shall apply this requirement for each component\n        separately.\n106.    The activity participants shall calculate, as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-\n        DD, the difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the\n        crediting period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward\n        adjustment based on BAU.\n107.    The activity participants shall determine whether the baseline must be adjusted\n        downwards as per the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD.\n108.    If the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents include different scenarios or cases or provide\n        different options and/or default values to choose from, the activity participants shall justify\n        their choice in accordance with the modalities in the generic CP as per paragraph 59\n        above.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n109.    Activity participants shall identify the potential leakage sources, justify the exclusion of any\n        source and identify how these sources are avoided or minimized as per the modalities\n        contained in the generic CP-DD.\n110.    The activity participants shall ensure that the application of default data in the estimation\n        of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the CP is in accordance with the\n        generic CP as described as per paragraph 62 above.\n\n7.5.8. Monitoring plan\n111.    The activity participants shall develop and describe a monitoring plan for the CP in\n        accordance with the modalities in the generic CP as described as per paragraphs 64−69\n        above.\n112.    For CPs involving removals, activity participants shall carry out the monitoring of removals\n        based on data derived from measurements, sampling, remote-sensing, third party sources\n        and published literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and\n        take appropriate account of the associated uncertainties as per the modalities contained\n        in the generic CP-DD.\n113.    The activity participants may choose to make a delayed submission of the monitoring plan,\n        that is after the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA and at any time prior to the\n        submission of the request for issuance of A6.4 ERs that covers the first monitoring period\n        of the CP.\n114.    If the activity participants choose to make a delayed submission of the monitoring plan in\n        accordance with paragraph 113 above, they shall clearly state in the CP-DD that the\n        submission of the monitoring plan is delayed and therefore the CP-DD submitted for\n        inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA does not contain information related to the\n        monitoring plan.\n115.    For CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the\n        monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan of CPs included in a registered A6.4 PoA\n        shall be reviewed and updated during the crediting period and verified by a DOE if:\n        (a)     The DOE or the Supervisory Body identifies the need to revise the monitoring plan\n                of a particular CP/(s) based on any concerns identified with the monitoring plan\n                and the risk assessment plan;\n        (b)     Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are\n                not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan of\n                a particular CP/(s);\n        (c)     The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk\n                factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring\n                plan and the risk assessment plan of a particular CP/(s).\n\n7.6.     Start date, crediting period type and duration\n116.    The activity participants shall determine the start date of the CP as the date on which the\n        activity participants commit to making expenditures for the construction or modification of\n        the main equipment or facility (e.g. a wind turbine), or for the provision or modification of\n        a service (e.g. distribution of energy-efficient light bulbs, change of transport management\n        system) under the CP. Where a contract is signed for such expenditures (e.g. for\n\n\n\n                                                  28 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        procurement of a wind turbine), the start date is the date on which the contract is signed.\n        In other cases, it is the date on which such expenditures are incurred. If the CP involves\n        more than one of such contracts or incurred expenditures, the start date is the earliest of\n        the respective dates. Activities incurring minor pre-project expenses (e.g. feasibility\n        studies, preliminary surveys) are not considered in the determination of the start date.\n117.    The start date of the proposed CP shall be both (i) on or after 1 January 2021, and (ii) on\n        or after the start date of the PoA period as determined in accordance with paragraph 27\n        above.\n118.    The activity participants shall specify the reference to the notification to the secretariat of\n        the intention for the CP to be included in a registered A6.4 PoA submitted in accordance\n        with the activity cycle procedure.\n119.    The activity participants shall specify the expected operational lifetime of the CP and adjust\n        the crediting period(s) accordingly in cases where the DNA has specified conditions that\n        ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) is shorter than the lifetime of the\n        technology implemented, including any replacements undertaken during the crediting\n        period.\n120.    The activity participants shall specify in the CP-DD the crediting period type (renewable or\n        fixed), start date and duration of the crediting period of the CP consistent with the\n        indication made in the generic CP as per paragraph 70 above. In this context, the start\n        date of the crediting period of the CP shall be on or after the date of inclusion of the CP in\n        the registered A6.4 PoA.\n121.    The activity participants shall state the start date of the crediting period of the CP in the\n        format dd/mm/yyyy and shall not attach any qualifications to the start date, such as\n        “expected”.\n122.    A CP that has been included in a registered A6.4 PoA may not be re-included in the same\n        or different registered A6.4 PoA, or registered as an A6.4 project, after the expiry of its\n        final crediting period.\n123.    The crediting period of a CP shall not exceed the end of the duration of the PoA, regardless\n        of the crediting period type (renewable or fixed) of the CP.\n124.    The start date of the crediting period of a CP may be as early as 1 January 2021, but no\n        later than two years from the date of the notification of inclusion or from the date of\n        inclusion of the CP in a registered PoA in accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n\n7.7.    Environmental, social and sustainable development impacts\n125.    The activity participants shall carry out an assessment of the environmental, social and\n        sustainable development impacts of the CP, and provide in the CP-DD a summary of the\n        assessment and monitoring plan of such impacts and planned remedial measures of\n        negative impacts, if any, during the implementation and operation of the CP in accordance\n        with the A6.4 SD Tool reflecting the generic CP requirements in this regard referred to in\n        paragraph 72(m) above, and the filled-in forms required by the A6.4 SD Tool as follows:\n        (a)     Provide the identification, evaluation and avoidance of environmental and/or social\n                risks that may be caused by a proposed A6.4 activity in the A6.4 Environmental\n                and social safeguards risk assessment form;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  29 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (b)     Provide the relevant mitigation and minimization measures and monitoring to be\n                implemented in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form if there\n                is any risk identified in the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                assessment form;\n        (c)     Provide the evaluation of sustainable development impacts and the measuring,\n                monitoring and reporting methodology in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact\n                form.\n126.    In addition, if an environmental impact assessment and/or social impact assessment were\n        carried out for the CP as required by and in accordance with the relevant procedures of\n        the host Party, the activity participants shall provide all conclusions of such assessments\n        and references to all related documentation reflecting the CP generic requirements in this\n        regard referred to in paragraph 72(m) above.\n127.    If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by activity participants or by the DOE\n        during the validation for inclusion process, that exceed the environmental and social\n        safeguard elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation,\n        activity participants may request a deviation through the DOE and shall revise the\n        respective A6.4 SD Tool forms accordingly.\n\n7.8.    Integrity safeguards\n128.    The CP, in its development, implementation and operation shall not involve any illegal\n        activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery and criminal activities.\n        For this purpose, the activity participants shall prepare a declaration and submit it to the\n        DOE for its validation as part of the documentation for the inclusion of the CP in\n        accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n\n7.9.    Local stakeholder consultation\n129.    The activity participants shall conduct a local, and where appropriate, subnational\n        stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively referred to as local stakeholder\n        consultation) on the CP in accordance with applicable host Party rules but also in line with\n        the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional elements for consultation\n        required by the A6.4 SD Tool, at minimum, reflecting the generic CP specific requirements\n        in this regard referred to in paragraph 72(l) above. In this context:\n        (a)     If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional\n                elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool require more than those\n                required by the host Party rules, the activity participants shall follow the former by\n                additionally conducting the “gap” of the two;\n        (b)     If any elements of the modalities contained in Appendix 2 and any additional\n                elements for consultation required by the A6.4 SD Tool are not compatible with the\n                relevant host Party rules and where it is not possible to follow the requirement in\n                subparagraph (a) above, the activity participants shall describe the modalities\n                chosen and justify the choice.\n\n7.10. Eligibility for inclusion\n130.    The activity participants shall demonstrate how the CP meets the eligibility criteria for\n        inclusion as defined in the generic CP in accordance with section 6.12.11 above.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  30 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n8.      Post-registration activities\n8.1.    Continuous engagement of stakeholders\n131.    The activity participants shall review the comments on the registered A6.4 PoA or on any\n        of the included CPs submitted from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-admitted observer\n        organizations and published on the UNFCCC website in accordance with the activity cycle\n        procedure, if any.\n132.    The activity participants shall address the issues raised in the comments referred to in\n        paragraph 131 above as appropriate and provide a summary of how they have addressed\n        the comments in the next monitoring report.\n\n8.2.    Integrity safeguards\n133.    The activity participants shall continue to ensure that the development, implementation\n        and operation of the registered A6.4 PoA and included CPs do not involve any illegal\n        activities, including money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, bribery and criminal activities.\n\n8.3.    Post-registration changes\n\n8.3.1. General requirements\n134.    If there is any change regarding the modalities or information in the MoC statement\n        referred to in paragraph 35 above after the request for registration of the A6.4 PoA has\n        been submitted, the activity participants shall revise the MoC statement and obtain\n        approval of the change from the secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle\n        procedure.\n135.    The activity participants shall identify any proposed or actual changes to the\n        implementation, operation or monitoring of the registered A6.4 PoA or any included CP.\n136.    The activity participants shall determine whether the proposed or actual changes are\n        temporary deviations referred to in section 8.3.2 below, or permanent changes referred to\n        in section 8.3.3 below.\n137.    For temporary deviations, the activity participants are not required to prepare a revised\n        PoA-DD or CP-DD but shall describe the actual changes in the monitoring report. For\n        permanent changes, the activity participants shall prepare a revised PoA-DD or CP-DD,\n        the revised A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the revised\n        A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the revised A6.4 Sustainable\n        development impact form (in both track-change and clean versions) that reflects the\n        proposed or actual changes, using the valid version of the applicable PoA-DD or CP-DD\n        forms. The activity participants shall provide a summary of the changes, including the\n        reasons for the changes and any additional information relating to the changes to the PoA-\n        DD or CP-DD.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n8.3.2.

If the activity participants are temporarily unable to monitor any included CP in accordance\n        with the monitoring plan in the CP-DD (hereinafter referred to as the registered monitoring\n        plan), the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 Sustainable\n        development impact form, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines\n        or the other applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool, the\n        activity participants shall describe the nature, extent and duration of the non-conforming\n        monitoring period in the monitoring report, and:\n        (a)     Propose alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-conforming monitoring\n                period. In this case, the activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions\n                or discount factors to the calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of\n                the deviation; or\n        (b)     Apply the following most conservative values approach when alternative\n                monitoring arrangements are not proposed:\n                (i)    If the CP is to achieve GHG emission reductions, apply zero for baseline\n                       GHG emissions for the entire non-conforming monitoring period; or\n                (ii)   Apply the values assuming that the source of GHG emissions is operated at\n                       the maximum capacity for the entire non-conforming monitoring period. In\n                       the case of project GHG emissions related to the consumption of electricity,\n                       add 10 per cent to account for transmission and distribution losses.\n139.    If the monitoring of environmental, social and sustainable development parameters results\n        in negative impacts that exceed the risks identified in the A6.4 activity in the A6.4\n        Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form and the indicators defined in\n        the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and in the A6.4 Sustainable\n        development impact form and cannot be remediated by conducting additional consultation\n        with stakeholders or by employing mitigation measures, the activity participants shall\n        describe in the monitoring report the reasons for the negative impact and the measures\n        that will be employed to prevent the negative impact in the future.\n\n8.3.3. Permanent changes\n\n8.3.3.1.        Corrections\n140.    If the activity participants make any corrections to the information or parameters fixed at\n        registration of the A6.4 PoA or inclusion of a CP as described in the registered PoA-DD or\n        CP-DD, the activity participants shall document these corrections in a revised PoA-DD or\n        CP-DD.20\n\n\n\n\n20 This provision does not allow the parameter values fixed ex ante at the time of the registration of the\n\n  A6.4 PoA or inclusion of a CP to be updated, as it is not regarded as a correction.\n\n\n\n                                                  32 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n8.3.3.2.        Changes to the start date of the crediting period of component project\n141.    The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA may request a change to the start date\n        of the crediting period of any included CP if no request for issuance involving that CP has\n        been submitted yet and if the host Party approves the change in accordance with the\n        activity cycle procedure. In this context:\n        (a)     The new start date shall not be later than two years from the date of inclusion of\n                the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA;\n        (b)     Delaying the start date by up to one year or bringing forward the start date shall\n                not require any review and change to the application of methodologies and\n                standardized baselines;\n        (c)     Delaying the start date by more than one year shall require full review and possible\n                change to the selection and the application of methodologies and standardized\n                baselines.\n\n8.3.3.3.        Inclusion of monitoring plan\n142.    The activity participants may submit the monitoring plan of a CP after its inclusion in a\n        registered PoA in accordance with paragraph 113 above.\n\n8.3.3.4.        Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool\n                forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the\n                A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4\n                Sustainable development impact form), or permanent deviation of\n                monitoring from the applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool\n143.    If the activity participants are unable to implement the registered monitoring plan for any\n        included CP, or the monitoring for any included CP would permanently deviate from the\n        applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool, the activity participants\n        shall describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed\n        alternative monitoring for the CP in a revised CP-DD. If the permanent change or deviation\n        is not in line with the description of how to develop the monitoring plan of each CP provided\n        in the PoA-DD, the activity participants shall revise the PoA-DD before revising the CP-\n        DD.\n144.    If the monitoring would permanently deviate from the A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, the activity participants shall\n        describe the nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed\n        alternative monitoring for the project in the revised A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form.\n145.    If the monitoring plan and risk assessment plan need to be reviewed and updated as per\n        paragraph 115 above, the activity participants shall describe the changes to the monitoring\n        plan and risk assessment plan in a revised CP-DD.\n146.    The activity participants shall apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the\n        calculations in the proposed alternative monitoring to the extent required to ensure that\n\n\n\n                                                  33 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not be over-estimated as a result of\n        the permanent change or deviation.\n\n8.3.3.5.         Changes to programme design\n147.    Where there are changes to the programme design of a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity\n        participants shall prepare a revised PoA-DD that describes the nature and extent of the\n        proposed or actual changes.\n148.    Changes to a registered A6.4 PoA may include:\n        (a)      Changes to the programme boundary to expand the geographical coverage or to\n                 include additional host Parties;\n        (b)      The following revisions to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA:\n                 (i)     Revision to the eligibility criteria due to the revision or replacement of the\n                         applied methodologies by the Supervisory Body;21\n                 (ii)    Addition or change of technologies/measures with or without addition or\n                         change of applied methodologies in the registered PoA-DD as referred in\n                         subparagraph (f) below.\n                 (iii)   Revision to the eligibility criteria pertaining to the demonstration of\n                         additionality;\n        (c)      Removal of applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines from the\n                 registered PoA-DD;\n        (d)      Changes to the capacity22 range specified in the registered PoA-DD;\n        (e)      Any change of programme design;\n        (f)      Adding new components or extending/adding technologies/measures, provided\n                 that they comply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that the host Party would\n                 approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs, that introduce:\n                 (i)     Complementary technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy\n                         transfer to/from the technologies/measures specified in the originally\n                         registered PoA-DD;23 or\n\n21 As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to apply a revised version\n\n  of the methodology that is different from the version applied for the registration of the PoA. However, the\n  activity cycle procedure also specifies that no new CPs can be included in the PoA until a post-\n  registration change to the PoA to reflect the requirements of the new version of the methodology is\n  approved by the Supervisory Body.\n22 Installed/rated capacity of technologies and/or measures that directly impacts emission reductions or net\n\n  removals.\n23 Examples include:\n\n\n    (a) A landfill gas capture and electricity generation activity using three electricity generating units adds\n        an additional electricity generating unit without altering the quantity of landfill gas extracted (i.e. the\n        capacity of the landfill gas extraction system remained the same);\n    (b) Addition of a back-up electricity generating source to supply electricity during exigencies when the\n        project fails to meet the demand or is not available due to operational reasons.\n\n\n\n                                                    34 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                (ii)   More advanced version of the same technologies as per the definition of “the\n                       same technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above (e.g. improved performance in\n                       GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, efficiency, health, safety\n                       and durability evidenced in reference to a relevant national or international\n                       standard);24\n        (g)     Removing a component or technology/measure specified in the registered PoA-\n                DD;\n        (h)     Changing     the   technologies/measures       that    result  in   the    same\n                technologies/measures as the technologies/measures in the originally registered\n                PDD as per the definition of “the same technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above;25\n        (i)     Any consequential changes to the application of methodologies, standardized\n                baselines and/or other methodological regulatory documents resulting from the\n                changes referred to in subparagraphs (a)−(h) above, including changes to or\n                addition of other methodologies, other standardized baselines and/or other\n                methodological regulatory documents, or application of a baseline scenario that is\n                more appropriate as a result of the modifications to the PoA;\n        (j)     Voluntarily updating the applied methodologies or the other applied methodological\n                regulatory documents to a later valid version of them, or voluntarily changing to\n                other methodologies, provided all requirements in the updated/changed\n                methodologies and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are\n                met;\n        (k)     Revision of generic CP to:\n                (i)    Apply an applicable and valid standardized baseline to determine baseline\n                       emissions or parameter values;\n                (ii)   Switch from an ex post to an ex ante determination of parameter values for\n                       calculating baseline emissions using a standardized baseline, subject to the\n                       provisions and conditions set out in paragraph 186 below.\n149.    If the change to a registered A6.4 PoA is to include an additional host Party as referred to\n        in paragraph 148(a) above, the new host Party shall approve the PoA as per the\n        requirements in the activity cycle procedure.\n150.    For any post-registration changes to the PoA that may result in an increase in the\n        maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to\n        be achieved that was previously approved by the host Party, an approval of the post-\n        registration changes by the respective host Party is required as per the requirements of\n        the activity cycle procedure.\n151.    For the cases of revisions of the eligibility criteria that are not referred to in paragraph\n        148(b) above, the activity participants shall seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on\n        the appropriateness of the revision in accordance with the “Procedure: Consideration of\n        unsolicited letters to the Supervisory Body”.\n\n24 Examples include a project disseminating lamps with a useful life of two years changing to distribute\n\n  lamps with a useful life of seven years.\n25 Examples include changing the mode of utilization of recovered methane from a landfill, such as shifting\n\n  from flaring to heat generation or from heat generation to electricity generation.\n\n\n\n                                                  35 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n152.    The activity participants shall report in the revised PoA-DD the impacts of the proposed or\n        actual changes to the registered A6.4 PoA on the following:\n        (a)     The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents with which the PoA has been registered;\n        (b)     The modalities for setting the project boundary for corresponding CPs and any\n                implications on the inclusion or exclusion of emission sources and leakage\n                emissions;\n        (c)     The compliance of the modalities for developing monitoring plans for all\n                corresponding CPs with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n                baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents;\n        (d)     The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring for corresponding CPs\n                compared with the monitoring as per the monitoring plans developed by the\n                modalities contained in the registered PoA-DD;\n        (e)     The additionality of corresponding CPs;\n        (f)     The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA;\n        (g)     The maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                expected to be achieved by CPs implemented in each of the host Parties that may\n                be included in the PoA.\n153.    If the proposed or actual changes to the registered A6.4 PoA affect the additionality of\n        corresponding CPs as referred to in paragraph 148(b) above, the demonstration of the\n        impacts of the changes on the additionality shall be based on the original input data for all\n        elements other than those affected by the changes.26 In addition, [Placeholder for\n        additionality requirements at renewal].27\n154.    Where the activity participants cannot demonstrate compliance with the requirements of\n        the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents with which the A6.4 PoA has been registered, the\n        activity participants shall:\n        (a)     Revise the PoA-DD, applying:\n                (i)    A later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n                       baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents; or\n                (ii)   Other methodologies, other standardized baselines or other methodological\n                       regulatory documents that are applicable to the PoA; and\n\n\n\n\n26 Ifa proposed or actual modification adversely impacts the additionality of the project, subsequent\n   requests for issuance of A6.4ERs based on such modifications will be rejected.\n27 The content of this sentence depends on a revision of the additionality standard to cover methodologies\n\n   for activities undertaken at other scales, such as programmes of activities, therefore a placeholder is\n   included here. A full sentence will be developed in a future version of this document once the Supervisory\n   Body adopts a revised version of the additionality standard.\n\n\n\n                                                  36 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        (b)     Demonstrate the compliance with the requirements of the newly applied\n                methodologies, standardized baselines and other applied methodological\n                regulatory documents in the revised PoA-DD.\n\n8.3.3.6.        Changes to design of component project\n155.    Changes to the design of an included CP shall meet the following conditions:\n        (a)     Increasing the capacity28 specified in the CP-DD;\n        (b)     Decreasing the capacity specified in the CP-DD provided that the decreased\n                capacity falls within the capacity range of the generic CP;\n        (c)     Adding new components or extension/addition of technologies/measures provided\n                that the resulting technologies/measures are covered by the generic CP;\n        (d)     Changing      technologies/measures         provided    that     the       changed\n                technologies/measures are covered by the generic CP and are the same\n                technologies/measures as in the originally included CP as per the definition of “the\n                same technologies” in paragraph 85(b) above;\n        (e)     The included CP with the changes is within the scope of the generic CP;\n        (f)     The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs for the technologies/measures referred\n                to in subparagraphs (c) and (d) above are specified in the generic CP.\n156.    In case of any changes to the CP that may result in exceeding the maximum annual\n        amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by\n        the registered PoA, the activity participant shall revise the PoA-DD and obtain approval by\n        the Supervisory Body of the post-registration change to the PoA first, which is also\n        conditional to an approval by the host Party of the post-registration change as per the\n        requirements of the activity cycle procedure.\n157.    The activity participants shall report in the revised CP-DD the impacts of the proposed or\n        actual changes to the included CP on the following:\n        (a)     The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents with which the CP has been included;\n        (b)     The project boundary and any implications on the inclusion or exclusion of\n                emission sources and leakage emissions;\n        (c)     The compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents;\n        (d)     The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring for the CP compared\n                with the requirements contained in the registered monitoring plan;\n        (e)     The additionality of the CP;\n        (f)     The compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool.\n\n\n28 Installed/rated capacity that directly impacts GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  37 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n158.    If the proposed or actual changes affect the additionality of the included CP as referred to\n        in paragraph 157(e) above, the demonstration of the impacts of the changes on the\n        additionality shall be based on the original input data for all elements other than those\n        affected by the changes.29\n159.    If the proposed or actual changes referred to in paragraph 155 above affect the\n        identification, assessment or monitoring of environmental, social or sustainable\n        development impacts, the activity participants shall reassess, based on paragraph 157(f)\n        above, the impact caused by the changes by providing a revised version of the A6.4\n        Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, the A6.4 Environmental and\n        social management plan form (if applicable) and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact\n        form. These revised forms shall be subject to validation by a DOE prior to or as part of the\n        first verification of emission reductions or net removals.\n160.    Where the activity participants cannot demonstrate compliance with the requirements of\n        the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents with which the CP has been included, the activity\n        participants shall firstly undergo post-registration change to the registered A6.4 PoA in\n        accordance with paragraph 154 above, then:\n        (a)     Revise the CP-DD, applying the methodologies, standardized baselines and the\n                other methodological regulatory documents in accordance with the generic CP in\n                the revised PoA-DD;\n        (b)     Demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the newly applied\n                methodologies, the newly applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n                methodological regulatory documents in the revised CP-DD.\n\n8.3.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme\n161.    If an A6.4 PoA or CP, after its registration under the Article 6.4 mechanism or inclusion in\n        a registered A6.4 PoA, is also registered or included, or covered by a programme, under\n        any other international, regional, national, subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation\n        crediting scheme, the activity participants shall obtain a confirmation from the other\n        scheme of such registration or coverage.\n\n8.3.5.

If any of the activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA change after the registration of\n        the PoA, the activity participants shall revise the PoA-DD to reflect the change and obtain\n        an authorization of the new activity participant from any of the host Parties of the PoA\n        through a dedicated interface in accordance with the activity cycle procedure. It is not\n        required to request approval from the Supervisory Body of the change.\n\n8.4.    Reversals-related actions for component projects involving removals and\n        emission reductions component projects with reversal risks\n163.    In case of occurrence of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that\n        could potentially lead to a reversal in CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA, activity\n        participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report in order to determine whether\n\n29 If a proposed or actual modification adversely impacts the additionality of the CP, subsequent requests\n\n  for issuance of A6.4ERs based on such modifications will be rejected.\n\n\n\n                                                  38 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        the observed event has resulted in an actual reversal. The report shall contain the\n        following information:\n        (a)     A description of the monitoring activities and methods used for each affected CP;\n        (b)     The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the\n                monitoring period for each affected CP, together with the associated uncertainty;\n        (c)     Data collected for each affected CP, including the remote-sensing data, or if the\n                data set is too large, a summary of the data and an indication of how the full data\n                set can be accessed;\n164.    If the observed event in CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA is an ongoing event, the\n        preliminary assessment report shall be prepared after the event has ended or has been\n        fully contained.\n165.    The preliminary assessment report shall conclude, for each affected CP and on the basis\n        of transparent and verifiable evidence, whether the observed event did or did not result in\n        actual reversals.\n166.    If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report or if the\n        preliminary assessment concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual\n        reversal in some or in all of the affected CPs, the activity participants shall prepare a\n        monitoring report covering some or all of the affected CPs based on the monitoring plan\n        contained in the CP-DDs of affected CPs and submit it to a DOE for verification. The\n        monitoring report shall include:\n        (a)     A description of the monitoring activities and methods used for each affected CP;\n        (b)     The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the\n                monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty, for each affected CP;\n        (c)     Data collected for each affected CP, including the remote-sensing data, or if the\n                data set is too large, a summary of the data and an indication of how the full data\n                set can be accessed;\n        (d)     Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could\n                have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions, along with a\n                summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period\n                covered by the monitoring report as per the removals standard, for each affected\n                CP;\n        (e)     Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed for each\n                affected CP, consistent with the risk mitigation measures described in the\n                respective CP-DDs;\n        (f)     Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been\n                assessed, mitigated, and managed for each affected CP, consistent with the\n                measures described in the respective CP-DD.\n167.    Following the submission of the monitoring report referred in paragraph 166 above, activity\n        participants shall:\n        (a)     Review and update the risk assessment of the affected CP(s) and revise their risk\n                rating as necessary, which shall include the development of plans to prevent further\n\n\n\n\n                                                  39 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                releases of GHGs. The review and update shall be done through a post-registration\n                change;\n        (b)     Review the compliance with the requirements and safeguards contained in the\n                A6.4 SD Tool for each affected CP, taking into account any negative environmental\n                and social impacts caused by the reversal. Further, the activity participants shall\n                develop plans to prevent the recurrence of such negative environmental and social\n                impacts;\n        (c)     Review and update the monitoring plan for each affected CP in case additional risk\n                factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are not adequately\n                addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan.\n\n9.

If there is a period within the duration of the monitoring period when the\n                       monitoring did not take place due to force majeure circumstances or for\n                       which the issuance of A6.4ERs is not sought, the monitoring report shall\n                       clearly indicate such period and state situations;\n                (ii)   The monitoring reports prepared for each batch/group of CPs shall cover the\n                       entire duration of a common monitoring period among the batches/groups of\n\n\n\n                                                  40 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                        CPs, without a gap between the two successive monitoring periods. For CPs\n                        involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the\n                        monitoring reports prepared for each batch/group of CPs shall be submitted\n                        within the frequency specified by the selected methodologies or in shorter\n                        intervals, or following the observation of an event of GHG release that could\n                        potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in section 8.4 above;\n                (iii)   A6.4ERs for the previous monitoring period for CPs included in a batch have\n                        been issued;\n        (c)     The start date of the first monitoring period shall be the earliest date of the start of\n                the first crediting periods of all CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA. If actual\n                GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals have not started at the start of the\n                crediting period, the monitoring report for the first monitoring period shall report\n                zero GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the period until they\n                actually occur;\n        (d)     If negative GHG emission reductions (i.e. net GHG emissions) have occurred\n                during a monitoring period, such negative values shall be clearly indicated and\n                deducted from the total amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                for the monitoring period;\n        (e)     Monitored amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals shall be\n                presented in monitoring reports by year of their occurrence;\n        (f)     The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level environmental and social indicators\n                for each CP included in the batch/group of CPs shall be presented using the A6.4\n                Environmental and social management plan form of the A6.4 SD Tool, if applicable;\n        (g)     The outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level sustainable development indicators\n                for each CP included in the batch/group of CPs shall be presented using the A6.4\n                Sustainable development impact form of the A6.4 SD Tool;\n        (h)     The monitoring results for individual CPs shall be separated and grouped by CP\n                type defined in the corresponding generic CP-DD;\n        (i)     Monitoring reports shall be prepared in chronological order regarding any CP\n                covered by the monitoring reports and without a gap between the two successive\n                monitoring periods;\n        (j)     Monitoring results in different crediting periods of a CP shall be separated into\n                different monitoring reports.\n173.    Notwithstanding paragraphs 172(f) and 172(g) above, for those CPs that successfully\n        transitioned from the CDM and prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits\n        description report” in accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool” at\n        the time of transition, the monitoring report shall include the outcome of monitoring of the\n        sustainable development co-benefits of the CP based on the document describing how\n        the activity participant intends to monitor sustainable development co-benefits of the\n        activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring results in accordance with the\n        “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism”.\n174.    For CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the\n        monitoring reports shall be submitted within the frequency specified by the applied\n\n\n\n\n                                                  41 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        methodologies or in shorter intervals, or following the observation of an event of GHG\n        release that could potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in section 8.4 above.\n175.    All monitoring, verifications and requests for issuance of A6.4ERs in respect of GHG\n        emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by A6.4 projects shall be calculated\n        using the GWPs contained in Appendix 1 in accordance with section 5.2 above.\n176.    The activity participants shall maintain all monitoring results for the included CPs in\n        accordance with the monitoring management system described in the registered\n        monitoring plan as per paragraph 69 above.\n\n9.2.    General information\n177.    When describing the implementation and monitoring, the activity participants shall provide,\n        inter alia, the following information regarding the implemented registered A6.4 PoA:\n        (a)     The title and UNFCCC reference number of the PoA;\n        (b)     The names of the activity participants;\n        (c)     The titles, versions and UNFCCC reference numbers of the applied methodologies\n                and, where applicable, the applied standardized baselines, including any other\n                methodologies or methodological tools to which the applied methodologies refer;\n        (d)     The title, reference number, correspondence to a generic CP and location of each\n                included CP;\n        (e)     The type, start date and duration of the crediting period for each included CP;\n        (f)     Indication of which included CPs are covered by the monitoring report;\n        (g)     The monitoring period sequence number and dates of coverage;\n        (h)     The monitoring report identification number for the same monitoring period, if\n                multiple separate monitoring reports for the monitoring period are prepared;\n        (i)     The version number of the CP-DD applicable to the monitoring period for each\n                included CP.\n\n9.3.    Avoidance of double issuance\n178.    The activity participants shall confirm that the reported GHG emission reductions or net\n        GHG removals regarding which they intend to request issuance of A6.4ERs do not overlap\n        with any of the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals regarding which they have\n        requested or intend to request credits under any other international, regional, national,\n        subnational or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme. The activity participants shall\n        further acknowledge that if such double issuance is detected, the verification by the DOE\n        will result in a negative verification opinion, the request for issuance will be rejected by the\n        Supervisory Body, or the amount of double issuance will be deducted from future issuance\n        of A6.4ERs for the same registered A6.4 PoA if the requested A6.4ERs have already been\n        issued.\n179.    If the registered A6.4 PoA or included CPs are also registered, or covered by a\n        programme, under any other international, regional, national subnational or sector-wide\n        GHG mitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance, the activity participants\n\n\n\n                                                  42 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        shall also obtain a confirmation from the other crediting scheme that the same GHG\n        emission reductions or net GHG removals being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have\n        not been or will not be credited under such other crediting scheme.\n\n9.4.    Description of implemented registered programme of activities\n180.    The activity participants shall provide a description of the implemented registered A6.4\n        PoA as follows:\n        (a)     Description of how the management system of the PoA was implemented;\n        (b)     Description of how the single sampling plan covering all included CPs was\n                implemented, if applicable;\n        (c)     Description of the installed technologies, technical processes and equipment for\n                the included CPs;\n        (d)     Information on the implementation and actual operation of the included CPs,\n                including relevant dates (e.g. construction, commissioning, start of operation). For\n                a CP that consists of more than one site, the activity participants shall describe the\n                status of implementation and start date of operation for each site. For a CP with\n                phased implementation, the activity participants shall indicate the progress of the\n                CP achieved in each phase.\n181.    The activity participants shall indicate whether there are any temporary deviations from\n        the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents in accordance with\n        section 8.3.2 above, or permanent changes to the registered A6.4 PoA or included CPs,\n        or the registered monitoring plans in accordance with section 8.3.3 above (hereinafter\n        referred to as post-registration changes). For post-registration changes that have been\n        approved by the Supervisory Body, the activity participants shall indicate the dates of\n        approval.\n\n9.5.    Description of monitoring system\n182.    The activity participants shall describe the monitoring system and provide diagrams (e.g.\n        graphical schemes) showing all relevant monitoring points. This description may include\n        data collection procedures (e.g. information flow including data generation, aggregation,\n        recording, calculations and reporting), organizational structure, roles and responsibilities\n        of personnel, and emergency procedures for the monitoring system.\n\n9.6.    Data and parameters\n183.    The activity participants shall provide all parameters used to calculate the baseline, project\n        and leakage GHG emissions, or the baseline and actual net GHG removals, as well as\n        other relevant parameters of the included CPs for the monitoring period as required by the\n        registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents. The activity\n        participants shall provide information on how data and parameters have been monitored.\n184.    For each parameter, the activity participants shall:\n        (a)     Provide the values of the monitored parameter for the purpose of calculating GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals. Where data are measured\n\n\n\n                                                  43 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                continuously, they shall be presented using an appropriate time interval. For a\n                default value that is not fixed at the time of the registration of the A6.4 PoA or the\n                inclusion of the CPs, the most recent value shall be applied;\n        (b)     Describe the equipment used to monitor each parameter, including details on\n                accuracy class, and calibration information (i.e. frequency, date of calibration and\n                validity), if applicable, as per the registered monitoring plan;\n        (c)     Describe how the parameter is measured/calculated and the measurement and\n                recording frequency;\n        (d)     Provide and/or identify the sources of data (e.g. logbooks, daily records, surveys);\n        (e)     Provide the calculation method of the parameter, where relevant;\n        (f)     Describe the QA/QC procedures applied, if applicable, as per the registered\n                monitoring plan;\n        (g)     Provide information about appropriate emission factor, IPCC default value and any\n                other reference value.\n185.    If data and parameters monitored are determined by a sampling approach, the activity\n        participants shall describe how the sampling has been conducted in accordance with the\n        sampling plan described in the registered monitoring plan.\n186.    For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a\n        choice between an ex ante and an ex post determination of parameter values for\n        calculating baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals for a generic CP and that chose\n        the ex ante determination, or that applied a methodology or methodological tool requiring\n        a determination of these values ex ante, and applied an applicable standardized baseline\n        valid at the time of the submission of the request for registration of the PoA for this purpose\n        to the generic CP, the activity participants shall apply the version of the standardized\n        baseline valid at the time of the inclusion of a corresponding CP for the purpose of\n        monitoring the CP until the end of the first crediting period of the CP. If no valid version of\n        the applied standardized baseline is available at the time of the inclusion of a\n        corresponding CP despite the fact that the corresponding generic CP applied the\n        standardized baseline, the activity participants shall calculate baseline GHG emissions or\n        net GHG removals, or parameter values in accordance with the applied methodology\n        and/or applicable methodological tool and apply them to the CP until the end of its first\n        crediting period of the CP.\n187.    For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a\n        choice between an ex ante and an ex post determination of parameter values for\n        calculating baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals and that chose the ex post\n        determination where there was no applicable standardized baseline valid at the time of\n        registration of the PoA, the activity participants may, at any time during the first PoA period,\n        switch to the ex ante determination by applying to the generic CP an applicable\n        standardized baseline that becomes available after the registration of the PoA and is valid\n        at the time of the switch. For all corresponding CPs that have been included before the\n        switch, the activity participants shall switch to the ex ante determination by applying the\n        standardized baseline as per the revised generic CP. After the switch, for all new\n        corresponding CPs, the activity participants shall apply the version of the standardized\n        baseline valid at the time of their inclusion or, if no valid version of the standardized\n        baseline is available at the time of their inclusion, the activity participants shall calculate\n\n\n\n                                                  44 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        these values in accordance with the applied methodology and/or applicable\n        methodological tool for the CPs. Such switch and application of a standardized baseline\n        shall undergo the post-registration change approval process for the PoA, and the switch\n        of all included CPs to the ex ante determination shall undergo post-registration change\n        notification process in accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n188.    For a registered A6.4 PoA that applied a methodology or methodological tool providing a\n        choice between an ex ante and ex post determination of parameter values for calculating\n        baseline GHG emissions or net GHG removals to generic CPs, the activity participants\n        shall, at each renewal of the PoA period, choose the ex ante or ex post determination of\n        parameter values for each generic CP individually, unless otherwise required by the\n        applied methodology or methodological tool, and shall follow the same rules in terms of\n        the use and validity of standardized baselines as in paragraphs 186 and 187 above.\n189.    Activity participants shall also submit the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan\n        form, if applicable, and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form containing all\n        parameters used to monitor the environmental and social impacts and the sustainable\n        development impacts for each CP included in the batch of requests for issuance and\n        explaining how any negative environmental and social impacts have been assessed,\n        mitigated and managed, consistent with the measures described in the registered CP-DD.\n190.    If unavoidable negative impacts are identified, either by the activity participants or by the\n        DOE during verification, that exceed the environmental and social safeguards elements\n        and criteria and cannot be remediated by consultation or mitigation, activity participants\n        may request a permanent deviation through the DOE and shall revise the respective A6.4\n        SD Tool forms accordingly.\n191.    For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs in the\n        monitoring report for each CP included in the batch of requests for issuance as part of the\n        investment analysis.\n\n9.7.    Calculation of emission reductions or net removals\n192.    The activity participants shall, for each of the included CPs for the monitoring period,\n        identify the formulae used for the calculations of, and provide calculation results of, the\n        following:\n        (a)     Baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals;\n        (b)     Project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals;\n        (c)     Leakage GHG emissions;\n        (d)     GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals .\n193.    Where the batch/group of CPs includes CPs involving removals that also result in emission\n        reductions, the accounting of removals and emission reductions shall be separated for\n        each CP in the monitoring report in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the\n        activity.\n194.    The activity participants shall provide a comparison of the GHG emission reductions or\n        net GHG removals achieved by the included CPs with the estimates in the registered CP-\n        DDs. The activity participants shall ensure that the sum of the amount of GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals requested for issuance and the cumulative amount of\n        GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals already issued for the PoA are up to the\n\n\n\n                                                  45 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n        maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by\n        the host Party; otherwise a post-registration change to the PoA shall be approved by the\n        host Party and the Supervisory Body as per the respective requirements of the activity\n        cycle procedure, prior to requesting issuance.\n195.    For any included CP, the activity participants shall explain the cause of any increase in\n        the actual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved during the monitoring\n        period (e.g. higher water availability, higher plant load factor), including all information (i.e.\n        data and/or parameters) that is different from what is stated in the CP-DD.\n\n10. Renewal of programme of activities and component\n    projects\n10.1. Renewal of programme of activities period\n196.    The activity participants of a registered A6.4 PoA shall renew the PoA period every five\n        years (every 15 years for the registered PoAs involving removals) counting from the start\n        date of the first PoA period as determined in accordance with paragraph 27 above.\n197.    The PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA may be renewed if the host Party has approved\n        the renewal when approving the PoA prior to its registration in accordance with the activity\n        cycle procedure.\n198.    To support a request for renewal of the PoA period of a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity\n        participants shall, using the valid version of the applicable PoA-DD form, update the\n        relevant sections of the PoA-DD of the PoA including the eligibility criteria for inclusion of\n        CPs in the PoA and for demonstrating additionality, and modalities for setting the baseline\n        and for preparing the monitoring plan and the new PoA period.\n199.    When updating the PoA-DD and its generic components, activity participants shall apply\n        methodologies in one of the following manners:\n        (a)     The activity participants shall use the valid version of the methodologies and\n                methodological tools applied in the registered PoA-DD; that is, the latest version at\n                the time of the submission of the request for renewal of the PoA period or the\n                previous version if the submission of the request is still within the grace period of\n                the previous version for use;30\n        (b)     If any of the methodologies applied in the registered PoA-DD was withdrawn after\n                the registration of the PoA and was replaced by consolidated methodologies, the\n                activity participants shall use the valid version of the consolidated methodologies;\n                or\n        (c)     If the PoA does not meet the applicability conditions of the methodologies or\n                methodological tools under the options in subparagraphs (a) or (b) above due to\n                their revisions or due to the update of the baseline, the activity participants shall\n                either:\n                (i)    Select other applicable approved methodologies; or\n\n\n30 Referredto in the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and\n  methodological tools”.\n\n\n\n                                                  46 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                (ii)   Request, under the clarification process in the “Procedure: Development,\n                       revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”, either\n                       through the DOE that conducts validation for renewal of the PoA period or by\n                       themselves, to clarify whether a deviation from the valid version of the\n                       methodologies (including consolidated methodologies thereof) or the\n                       methodological tools applied in the registered PoA-DD, or from any other\n                       selected methodologies or any other methodological tools applied in\n                       accordance with the selected methodologies, is acceptable.\n200.    In updating the PoA-DD of the registered A6.4 PoA in accordance with paragraphs 198\n        and 199 above, the activity participants shall consider the application of an approved\n        standardized baseline to the PoA as follows:\n        (a)     The activity participants shall use the valid version of an approved standardized\n                baseline if:\n                (i)    The standardized baseline is applied in the registered PoA-DD and the valid\n                       version of the standardized baseline is still applicable to the PoA and to the\n                       methodologies applied in accordance with paragraph 198 above; or\n                (ii)   The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PoA-DD but the\n                       valid version of the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory31 is\n                       applicable to the PoA and to the methodologies applied in accordance with\n                       paragraph 198 above. However, the activity participants may update the\n                       PoA-DD without selecting such standardized baseline if the submission of\n                       the request for renewal of the PoA period is made within 240 days after the\n                       standardized baseline became valid;\n        (b)     If the valid version of the standardized baseline applied in the registered PoA-DD\n                is no longer applicable to the PoA and/or to the valid version of the methodologies\n                applied in the registered PoA-DD due to a revision of the standardized baseline\n                after the registration of the PoA, the activity participants shall:\n                (i)    Select another applicable approved standardized baseline; or\n                (ii)   Use only the valid version of the methodologies applied in the registered\n                       PoA-DD that are still applicable to the PoA and that can be used\n                       independently for estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                       without using the standardized baseline applied in the registered PoA-DD;\n        (c)     The activity participants may use the valid version of an applicable approved\n                standardized baseline if:\n                (i)    The standardized baseline is not applied in the registered PoA-DD;\n                (ii)   The standardized baseline does not require its mandatory selection but is\n                       applicable to the PoA and to the methodologies applied in accordance with\n                       paragraph 198 above.\n201.    The activity participants shall demonstrate that the modalities for setting the baseline or\n        updating it for each of the corresponding CPs is in accordance with paragraphs 202−203\n        below.\n\n\n31 For an explanation on the standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory, see footnote 19.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  47 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n202.    When defining the modalities for setting the baseline or updating it, the activity participants\n        shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies, standardized\n        baselines, and other methodological regulatory documents.\n203.    If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline were determined ex ante\n        and not monitored during the PoA period and are no longer valid, the activity participants\n        shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be provided\n        by the Supervisory Body.\n204.    The result of the process described in paragraphs 198–203 above defines a new version\n        of the PoA-DD, including its generic CP-DD part.\n205.    The activity participants shall ensure that the MoC statement is up-to-date.\n206.    If the activity participants plan to make, or have made, a post-registration change to the\n        programme design effective from the start date of the new PoA period, they shall clearly\n        indicate the post-registration change in the new version of the PoA-DD, distinguishing the\n        post-registration change from other updates of information due to renewal of the PoA\n        period.\n\n10.2. Renewal of crediting period of component projects\n207.    To renew the crediting period of an included CP, the activity participants shall, using the\n        valid version of the applicable CP-DD form, update the sections of the CP-DD in\n        accordance with the latest version of the applicable generic component of the PoA-DD,\n        relating to:\n        (a)     The baseline emissions, including updating the downward adjustment as per\n                paragraphs 56 and 57 above;\n        (b)     The BAU scenario and emissions, and the difference between the baseline\n                emissions and BAU emissions as annual and total amounts with respect to the\n                crediting period to be renewed;\n        (c)     The estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals (if applicable);\n        (d)     The monitoring plan (if applicable);\n        (e)     The A6.4 SD Tool forms;\n        (f)     The risk assessment and monitoring plan for CPs involving removals and for\n                emission reduction CPs with reversal risks;\n        (g)     The crediting period.\n208.    To demonstrate the validity of the CP’s original baseline or its update, the activity\n        participants shall take into account the requirements of the applied methodologies,\n        standardized baselines, and other applied methodological regulatory documents as per\n        the modalities contained in the generic CP-DD.\n209.    If data and parameters used for determining the original baseline, which were determined\n        ex ante and were not monitored during the crediting period, are no longer valid, the activity\n        participants shall update such data and parameters in accordance with the guidance to be\n        provided by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  48 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n11. Post-crediting monitoring and reporting\n210.    For all CPs involving removals and for emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, activity\n        participants shall continue monitoring the CPs after the end of the last active crediting\n        period to:\n        (a)     Assess whether any reversals have occurred;\n        (b)     Quantify the amount of reversals; and\n        (c)     Confirm the continued storage of the GHGs.\n211.    Activity participants may terminate the post-crediting monitoring of CPs included in a\n        registered A6.4 PoA, subject to approval by the Supervisory Body, if they can\n        demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable information, that:\n        (a)     The stored GHGs in the CPs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or\n        (b)     The potential future reversals for CPs are remediated in accordance with the\n                provisions of the relevant section of the removals standard (i.e., Remediation of\n                reversals).\n\n12. Voluntary exclusion and re-inclusion of component\n    projects\n12.1. Voluntary exclusion of component projects\n212.    At any time after the inclusion of a CP in a registered A6.4 PoA, the activity participants\n        may request the secretariat to exclude the CP from the PoA in accordance with the activity\n        cycle procedure.\n213.    A CP that has been voluntarily excluded from a registered A6.4 PoA or excluded due to\n        erroneous inclusion may be re-included in the same or different registered A6.4 PoA in\n        accordance with section 12.2 below or registered as an A6.4 project in accordance with\n        the relevant provisions in the \"Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”.\n\n12.2. Re-inclusion of excluded component projects\n214.    The activity participants wishing to re-include an excluded CP in a registered A6.4 PoA\n        shall follow the process for inclusion of CPs in a registered A6.4 PoA in accordance with\n        the activity cycle procedure after ensuring that:\n        (a)     The CP-DD transparently declares that the CP has been previously excluded from\n                the same or different registered A6.4 PoA, either voluntarily or due to erroneous\n                inclusion;\n        (b)     The crediting period type (i.e. renewable or fixed) and the end date of the crediting\n                period are the same as those of the crediting period valid for the CP at the time of\n                the exclusion, noting that A6.4ERs may be claimed for the period only from or after\n                the date of re-inclusion, and:\n                (i)    If the crediting period type is renewable, the updated CP-DD shall be\n                       uploaded by the validating DOE within one year of the end date of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  49 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n                       crediting period valid for the CP at the time of the exclusion, noting that\n                       missing the deadline no longer allows the uploading of the updated CP-DD;\n                (ii)   If the crediting period type is fixed, the updated CP-DD shall be uploaded by\n                       the validating DOE prior to the end date of the crediting period valid for the\n                       CP at the time of the exclusion, noting that missing the deadline no longer\n                       allows the uploading of the updated CP-DD;\n        (c)     If the crediting period type is renewable and the re-inclusion takes place after the\n                end of the crediting period in which the exclusion occurred, the CP complies with\n                the generic CP, including the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA, and\n                relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements;\n        (d)     If the CP applies a methodology that potentially accrues negative GHG emission\n                reductions, GHG emission reductions have been continuously monitored in\n                accordance with the registered monitoring plan and verified by a DOE since the\n                end of the monitoring period in the last published monitoring report for the CP,\n                including the exclusion period. For such CP, if there were net negative GHG\n                emission reductions during the period before the re-inclusion, the amount shall be\n                deducted from the first requests for issuance of A6.4 ERs covering that CP after\n                the re-inclusion;\n        (e)     If the CP has been excluded as a result of erroneous inclusion and to be re-\n                included in the same PoA, the non-compliance with the requirements for inclusion\n                in the PoA that led to the erroneous inclusion has been rectified, and, if A6.4 ERs\n                have been issued for the CP, an equivalent amount of A6.4ERs have been\n                compensated by the DOE that included the CP, to the mechanism registry in\n                accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  50 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1.

Modalities of local stakeholder consultation\n\n1.     Scope and target of consultation\n1.      The scope of the local or subnational stakeholder consultation (hereinafter collectively\n        referred to as local stakeholder consultation) shall comprise, as a minimum, the potential\n        direct positive and negative impacts that the proposed component projects (CPs) that may\n        be included in a registered programme of activities under the mechanism established by\n        Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (A6.4 PoA) may have.\n2.      The local stakeholder consultation of proposed CPs shall be conducted for each CP. If\n        more than one CP is located in the same or close geographical location(s), one local\n        stakeholder consultation may cover multiple CPs. In this case, the activity participants\n        shall provide appropriate justification.\n3.      The activity participants shall invite, as a minimum, representatives of local stakeholders\n        directly impacted by the proposed CP, including local communities and Indigenous\n        Peoples, as applicable, and representatives of local authorities relevant to the CP.\n4.      The activity participants shall provide evidence that invitations were sent to the relevant\n        stakeholders and that their comments were invited. If any of the relevant stakeholders\n        were not invited, the activity participants shall provide appropriate justification.\n\n2.     Timing of consultation\n5.      The activity participants shall complete the local stakeholder consultation process at the\n        timing required by the rules of the host Party on local stakeholder consultation, if such\n        rules exist. If such host Party rules do not exist, the activity participants shall complete the\n        process before, whichever the earlier of:\n        (a)     The start date of the CP as defined in paragraphs 116−117 of the main part of this\n                standard; or\n        (b)     The date of submitting the component project design document (CP-DD) of the\n                proposed CP to a designated operational entity (DOE) for validation.\n6.      For CPs that do not meet the requirement referred to in paragraph 5 above, the activity\n        participants may submit a request for exemption from the requirement to the Supervisory\n        Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism for its consideration on a case-by-case basis.\n\n3.     Conduct of consultation\n7.      The activity participants shall invite local stakeholders to provide comments on the\n        proposed CP in an open and transparent manner, in a way that facilitates comments to be\n        received from local stakeholders and allows for a reasonable time for comments to be\n        submitted. The activity participants shall describe the steps/actions taken to invite\n        comments, taking into account local and national circumstances.\n8.      The activity participants shall convey information to stakeholders about the local\n        stakeholder consultation and the proposed CP in ways that are appropriate for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  52 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        community that is directly affected by the project. In areas where a significant part of the\n        population is illiterate, the information shall be provided orally.\n9.      The activity participants shall describe the proposed CP(s) in a manner that allows local\n        stakeholders to understand the project. The information to be made available to local\n        stakeholders shall include, inter alia:\n        (a)     A summary of the proposed CP, explaining the project in simple, non-technical\n                terms, and containing a description of the direct positive and negative impacts;\n        (b)     Information on the projected scope, lifetime and direct positive and negative\n                impacts of the proposed CP;\n        (c)     A summary of the analysis of the environmental and social impacts and sustainable\n                development benefits of the proposed CP and the three completed A6.4 SD Tool\n                forms;\n        (d)     Other relevant information about the proposed CP, taking into account\n                confidentiality provisions referred to in paragraph 9(e) of the main part of this\n                standard;\n        (e)     The means to provide comments about the proposed CP.\n10.     The activity participants shall conduct the local stakeholder consultation through means\n        that are appropriate for the local and national circumstances.\n11.     The activity participants shall provide local stakeholders with the opportunity to comment,\n        in writing or via other means and gather their comments about the proposed CP and its\n        direct impacts.\n12.     The activity participants shall request the designated national authority (DNA) of the host\n        Party to forward any comments from local stakeholders submitted to the host Party to\n        them.\n13.     The activity participants shall prepare a summary report of the comments received from\n        local stakeholders.\n14.     The activity participants shall consider the comments provided by local stakeholders and\n        report in the CP-DD on how they have taken them into account. The activity participants\n        shall provide justification if any comments were not incorporated.\n\n4.     Activities after consultation\n15.     After the completion of the local stakeholder consultation, local stakeholders may submit\n        a complaint to the DNA of the host Party if they find that the outcome of the local\n        stakeholder consultation is not appropriately taken into account. The DOE shall request\n        the DNA to forward such complaints, if any, to the DOE and promptly forward them to the\n        activity participants during the validation in accordance with the “Article 6.4 validation and\n        verification standard for programmes of activities”.\n16.     If, during the validation of the proposed CP, complaints submitted to the DNA of the host\n        Party on the handling of the outcome of the local stakeholder consultation are forwarded\n        to the activity participants through the DOE, the activity participants shall take due account\n\n\n\n\n                                                  53 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        of such complaints and modify the CP-DD as appropriate before the DOE concludes the\n        validation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  54 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 3. Instructions for the consideration of cross\n            effects for the application of multiple\n            methodologies for programme of activities\n\n215.    These instructions are applicable to a programme of activity (PoA) seeking to apply\n        multiple technologies/measures under the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph\n        4, of the Paris Agreement.\n216.    Cross-effects may occur when multiple technologies/measures are implemented, applying\n        either one methodology or multiple methodologies.\n217.    If a single methodology is consistently applied in each component project (CP) in a PoA\n        but using multiple technologies/measures, it may potentially lead to over-estimation of\n        greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions when several technologies/measures interact\n        with each other. The cross-effects in such situations shall be addressed through additional\n        guidance related to the application of the methodology for a PoA contained in the applied\n        methodology.\n218.    The activity participants shall consider the following situations to identify cross-effects.\n        These situations are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive and are intended to serve\n        as examples only:\n        (a)     Type I: Cross-effects could occur when there is an exchange of energy (thermal,\n                mechanical or electrical) or mass transfer between different measures within a CP\n                or between CPs, where the transfer occurs from a primary or independent measure\n                to a dependent measure;\n        (b)     Type II: Cross-effects could occur when several measures rely on the same\n                information when estimating GHG emission reductions. For example, several\n                measures refer to historical fuel/electricity/heat consumption or a default value.\n219.    The activity participants shall consider that, when combining different types of measures,\n        (e.g. energy efficiency and fuel switch), the baselines for different measures shall be\n        determined sequentially and not simultaneously. The baseline of the second\n        technology/measure shall be set after considering the effects of the implementation of the\n        first technology/measure:\n        (a)     For Type I cross-effects, the energy/mass stream of the dependent measure shall\n                be determined conservatively, taking into account the output of the primary\n                measure;\n        (b)     For Type II cross-effects, once a baseline is estimated/determined, the secondary\n                (tertiary, etc.) measure shall not use the historical/default values, but an adjusted\n                value taking into account a scenario in which the primary measure is implemented.\n\n                                                   -----\n\n\n\n\n                                                  55 of 56\nA6.4-STAN-AC-004\nStandard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                                        Document information\n\n Version        Date                   Description\n\n\n 02.0           16 May 2025            SBM 016, Annex 7.\n                                       Revision to incorporate CMA guidance, align with methodological\n                                       standards (Methodologies, Additionality and Removals), the SD\n                                       tool and provisions on authorization.\n 01.0           18 July 2024           SBM 013, Annex 3.\n                                       Initial adoption.\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Standard\n Business Function: A6.4 activity cycle\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, A6.4 programme of activities, activity standard, component project\n\n\n\n\n                                                     56 of 56\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism)1 and requested the Supervisory Body, among others, to develop\n          provisions for the development and approval of methodologies, validation, registration,\n          monitoring, verification and certification, issuance, renewal, first transfer from the\n          mechanism registry, voluntary cancellation and other processes pursuant to chapters\n          V.B–L and VIII of the RMPs.2\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, elaborated some elements of the RMPs relating to the\n          operation of the activity cycle of the Article 6.4 mechanism.3\n3.        The Supervisory Body, at its thirteenth meeting, adopted the “Article 6.4 validation and\n          verification standard for programmes of activities” (hereinafter referred to as this standard)\n          that sets out the requirements relating to validation and verification for Article 6.4\n          mechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and component projects (CPs).\n4.        The Supervisory Body, at its fourteenth meeting, adopted the “Standard: Application of the\n          requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of\n          Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”4 (hereinafter referred to as the methodologies\n          standard), the “Standard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article\n          6.4 mechanism”5 (hereinafter referred to as the removals standard) and the “Tool: Article\n          6.4 sustainable development tool” (hereinafter referred to as the A6.4 SD Tool). The two\n          standards set out the requirements for the development and assessment of Article 6.4\n          mechanism methodologies and the requirements for activities involving removals and\n          emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the Article 6.4 mechanism, whereas\n          the A6.4 SD Tool provides means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have\n          met the mandatory requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental\n          risks, as well as for assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to\n          sustainable development in line with sustainable development objectives and priorities of\n          the host Party and the sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n\n1.2.      Objectives\n5.        The objective of this standard is to set out requirements relating to validation and\n          verification for Article 6.4 mechanism programmes of activities (A6.4 PoAs) and\n          component projects (CPs) that may be included in registered A6.4 PoAs.\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

In assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of validation specified\n         throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including,\n         but not limited to:\n         (a)     Document review, involving:\n                 (i)    A review of data and information;\n                 (ii)   Cross-checks between the information provided in the PoA-DD and\n                        information from sources other than those used to determine whether the\n                        information in the PoA-DD is reliable; if available, the DOE’s sectoral or local\n                        expertise; and, if necessary, independent background investigations;\n\n\n\n9   All types of validation report forms are available on the UNFCCC website.\n10 All types of verification and certification report forms are available on the UNFCCC website.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  11 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     Follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection and telephone or e-mail interviews),\n                including:\n                (i)    Interviews with relevant stakeholders in the host country, such as personnel\n                       with knowledge of the A6.4 PoA design and implementation;\n                (ii)   Cross-checks between the information provided by interviewed personnel\n                       (i.e. by checking sources or other interviews) to ensure that no relevant\n                       information has been omitted;\n        (c)     Reference to available information relating to programmes, projects or\n                technologies similar to the proposed A6.4 PoA or CP under validation;\n        (d)     Review, based on the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n                baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, of the\n                appropriateness of formulae and accuracy of calculations;\n        (e)     Sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for\n                A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n25.     It is optional for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection for validation for the registration\n        of a proposed A6.4 PoA. If the DOE conducts an on-site inspection, it does not necessarily\n        need to include a visit to the geographical locations where CPs will be or are being\n        implemented, but the inspection could be to the office of the representative activity\n        participants. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site inspection as a means of validation,\n        it shall describe the alternative means used and justify that they are sufficient for the\n        purpose of validation.\n26.     Where no specific means of validation are specified, the DOE shall apply the standard\n        auditing techniques described in paragraph 24 above.\n\n6.1.3. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests\n27.     If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order\n        to determine whether the proposed A6.4 PoA meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism\n        rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure that these issues are accurately identified,\n        formulated, discussed and concluded in the validation report.\n28.

The DOE shall raise a clarification request (CL) if the information provided by the activity\n        participants is insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article\n        6.4 mechanism rules and requirements have been met.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  12 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n30.     The DOE shall raise a forward action request (FAR) if issues related to programme\n        implementation that require review during the first verification after the validation of the\n        proposed A6.4 PoA are identified. The DOE shall not raise a FAR that relates to the Article\n        6.4 mechanism rules and requirements for registration of the PoA.\n31.     The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify\n        the PoA design and/or the PoA-DD, or provide additional explanations or evidence that\n        satisfy the DOE’s concerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for\n        registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA.\n32.     The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its validation report. This reporting\n        shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity participants, the\n        means of validation of such responses, and references to any resulting changes in the\n        PoA-DD or its supporting documents.\n\n6.2.

Deviation from or revision of methodologies and/or methodological tools\n73.     The DOE may seek clarification from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a\n        deviation from a selected approved methodology, methodological tool or any other applied\n        methodological regulatory document in accordance with the “Procedure: Development,\n        revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” prior to the\n\n11 The valid version of a methodology is its latest version, or a previous version if the submission of the\n\n  request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA to the secretariat, in accordance with the activity cycle\n  procedure, is still within the grace period of the previous version for use in accordance with the\n  “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.\n\n\n\n                                                  18 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        submission of a request for registration or publication of the PoA-DD for global stakeholder\n        consultation (GSC), if the DOE, when performing validation for the proposed A6.4 PoA, or\n        upon request from the activity participants before the publication of the PoA-DD for GSC,\n        finds that, due to a PoA-specific12 issue implying that a revision of the methodology and/or\n        methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the activity participants\n        deviated from:\n        (a)     The selected methodology, methodological                  tool   or   any   other   applied\n                methodological regulatory document; or\n        (b)     Sections in the selected methodology, methodological tool or any other applied\n                methodological regulatory document that are not standardized by the selected\n                standardized baselines, if the proposed generic CP applies standardized\n                baselines.\n74.     Alternatively, if the DOE considers that a revision of the selected methodology,\n        methodological tool or any other applied methodological regulatory document would be\n        required to address the programme situation, the DOE shall submit, or request the activity\n        participants to submit, a request for revision in accordance with the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools”.\n\n6.3.2.3.        Clarification on applicability of methodologies and/or methodological tools\n                and/or standardized baseline\n75.     If the DOE cannot determine the applicability of a selected methodology, methodological\n        tool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed generic CP, the DOE shall request a\n        clarification on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision\n        and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and/or the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. The DOE shall\n        conduct an assessment to ensure that the request is not submitted with the intention of\n        revising the selected methodology, methodological tool and/or standardized baseline to\n        expand their applicability.\n\n12 Examples of PoA-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n  (a) The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a\n      certain method. The activity participants of the proposed PoA identify a difficulty in acquiring the\n      specified instrumentation or difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however, they can\n      achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative instrumentation or\n      measurement method;\n  (b) A proposed CP does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology for a certain\n      parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the CP to estimate the parameter with\n      equal reliability and accuracy;\n  (c) A minor deviation is sought for a PoA-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative. For\n      example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5% of rated\n      capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the plant has\n      never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated capacity\n      (20% below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying conservative approaches\n      to calculate the emission reduction in such a PoA-specific case;\n  (d) A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to\n      programme-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology. For example, a well-\n      justified conservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to\n      address uncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period.\n\n\n\n                                                  19 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n6.3.3. Application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n\n6.3.3.1.        General\n76.     The DOE shall validate that the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are applicable to\n        the design of the proposed generic CP and that the selected versions are valid at the time\n        of submission of the proposed A6.4 PoA for registration and, if applicable, are in\n        compliance with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party\n        in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs.\n77.     The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents were correctly\n        applied with respect to the following:\n        (a)     Applicability conditions;\n        (b)     Project boundary;\n        (c)     Baseline identification;\n        (d)     Algorithms and/or formulae used to determine emission reductions;\n        (e)     Additionality;\n        (f)     Monitoring methodology.\n78.     The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are correctly quoted\n        and applied by comparing them with the actual text of the valid version of these\n        documents, and relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n79.     If the generic CP applies a previous version of a methodology or a standardized baseline\n        but the request for registration of the proposed A6.4 PoA is likely to be submitted after the\n        grace period for applying the previous version in accordance with the validity section of\n        the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and\n        methodological tools”, the DOE shall request the activity participants to provide a revised\n        PoA-DD, applying the latest version of the methodology or other applicable and valid\n        methodology, or the standardized baseline in accordance with the activity standard.\n80.     If the generic CP does not apply a standardized baseline but the request for registration\n        of the proposed A6.4 PoA is likely to be submitted after an applicable approved\n        standardized baseline whose selection is mandatory has become valid and after the grace\n        period for not applying the standardized baseline in accordance with the validity section of\n        the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized\n        baselines”, the DOE shall request the activity participants to provide a revised PoA-DD,\n        applying the standardized baseline in accordance with the activity standard.\n81.     The DOE shall determine whether the generic CP meets all the applicability conditions of\n        the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents. This shall be undertaken by validating the\n        documentation referred to in the PoA-DD and by verifying that the documentation content\n        is correctly quoted and interpreted in the PoA-DD. If the DOE, based on local and sectoral\n        knowledge, is aware that comparable information is available from credible sources other\n        than those used in the PoA-DD, then the DOE shall cross-check the PoA-DD against such\n\n\n\n                                                  20 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        other sources to confirm that the generic CP meets the applicability conditions of the\n        selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents.\n82.     For each applicability condition listed in the selected methodologies, the selected\n        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the\n        DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the relevant information contained in the\n        PoA-DD against these criteria. The DOE shall state its opinion regarding the applicability\n        of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents to the proposed generic CP.\n83.     If the generic CP applies multiple methodologies, the DOE shall assess and state its\n        opinion on whether the methodologies were applied in accordance with the activity\n        standard.\n\n6.3.3.2.        Project boundary, sources and greenhouse gases\n84.     The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to define the project boundary of\n        each of the corresponding CPs, including which sources and GHGs are to be included in\n        the project boundary under which conditions or circumstances, is in accordance with the\n        applied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines.\n85.     The DOE shall confirm that the description of defining the project boundary is based on\n        documented evidence and, where conducted, an on-site inspection.\n86.     If the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines allow the activity\n        participants to choose whether a GHG source or gas is to be included within the project\n        boundary, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have justified that\n        choice. The DOE shall determine whether the justification provided is reasonable, based\n        on an assessment of supporting documented evidence provided by the activity\n        participants and corroborated by observations if required.\n87.     The DOE shall describe how the validation of the project boundary has been performed\n        by detailing the documentation assessed (e.g. a commissioning report) and, where\n        conducted, by describing its observations during any on-site inspection (i.e. observations\n        of the physical site or equipment used in the process).\n88.     The DOE shall state whether the description of how to define the project boundary of each\n        of the corresponding CPs and the selected GHG sources and gases are justified for the\n        generic CP. Should the DOE identify GHG emission sources that will be affected by the\n        implementation of corresponding CPs and which are expected to contribute more than 1\n        per cent of the overall expected average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals, and are not addressed by the applied methodologies or the applied\n        standardized baselines, the DOE shall request a clarification of, revision to, or clarification\n        for acceptance of deviation from the methodologies or the standardized baselines in\n        accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies\n        and methodological tools” or the “Procedure: Development, revision, clarification and\n        update of standardized baselines” as applicable.\n\n6.3.3.3.        Baseline scenario\n89.     The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to establish the baseline scenario\n        for each of the corresponding CPs is in accordance with the applied methodologies, an\n        approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, other applied\n\n\n\n                                                  21 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        methodological regulatory documents and, where applicable, the baseline approaches\n        specified by the host Party in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs. The DOE\n        shall assess whether a more ambitious baseline requirement, as determined by the host\n        Party and approved by the Supervisory Body, has been applied in the identification of the\n        most plausible baseline scenario, if applicable.\n90.     The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to establish the baseline scenario\n        in the case where it is foreseen that the future anthropogenic emissions by sources are\n        projected to rise above current levels due to the specific circumstances of the host Party\n        complies with guidance on suppressed demand in the applied methodology.\n91.     The DOE shall describe whether the description of the identification of the baseline\n        scenario in the generic CP-DD is in accordance with the selected standardized baseline if\n        the generic CP uses an approved standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline\n        scenario.\n92.     If the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the\n        identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on financial\n        expertise and local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are\n        considered by the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those\n        required by the methodologies, are realistic and credible in the context of the generic CP\n        and that no alternative scenario has been excluded.\n93.     The DOE shall determine whether any procedure contained in the applied methodologies,\n        methodological tool or other methodological regulatory documents to identify the most\n        reasonable baseline scenario has been correctly applied.\n94.     The DOE shall determine whether the identification of the most plausible baseline scenario\n        is reasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the\n        generic CP-DD. It shall determine whether the documents and sources referred to in the\n        generic CP-DD are correctly quoted and interpreted. The DOE shall cross-check the\n        information provided in the generic CP-DD with other verifiable and credible sources, such\n        as local expert opinion, if available.\n95.     The DOE shall determine whether the generic CP-DD provides a description of the\n        technology that would be deployed and/or the activities that would take place in the\n        absence of each of the corresponding CPs.\n96.     The DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the requirements and state its opinion\n        on whether:\n        (a)     All the assumptions and data used by the activity participants are listed in the\n                generic CP-DD, including their references and sources;\n        (b)     All documentation used is relevant for establishing the baseline scenario and\n                correctly quoted and interpreted in the generic CP-DD;\n        (c)     Assumptions and data used in the identification of the baseline scenario are\n                justified appropriately, supported by evidence, and can be deemed reasonable;\n        (d)     Relevant national and/or sectoral policies, regulations and circumstances are\n                considered and listed in the generic CP-DD;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  22 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (e)     The applied methodologies have been correctly followed to describe the\n                identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, and the description\n                reasonably represents what would occur in the absence of corresponding CPs.\n97.     The DOE shall describe other steps taken and sources of information used to cross-check\n        the information contained in the generic CP-DD.\n\n6.3.3.4.        Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark\n98.     The DOE shall assess whether, in the generic CP-DD, the identification and the\n        description of the business-as-usual (hereinafter referred as BAU) scenario or reference\n        benchmark emissions comply with the requirements of the activity standard, applied\n        methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n6.3.3.5.        Estimation of emission reductions or net removals\n99.     The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to undertake the ex ante and ex\n        post calculations of baseline, BAU, project and leakage GHG emissions or removals, as\n        well as GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, to be achieved by each of the\n        corresponding CPs are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents and,\n        where applicable, the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be\n        developed by the Supervisory Body.\n100.    Where the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents allow for selection between options for equations or\n        parameters, the DOE shall determine whether adequate justification has been provided\n        (based on the choice of the baseline scenario, context of the proposed generic CP and\n        other evidence provided) and that the correct equations and parameters have been used,\n        in accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n101.    The DOE shall verify the justification given in the generic CP-DD for the choice of data\n        and parameters used in the equations, as follows:\n        (a)     Data and parameters fixed ex ante: If data and parameters will not be monitored\n                throughout the crediting periods of corresponding CPs but will be determined prior\n                to their inclusion in the proposed A6.4 PoA individually for each CP and will remain\n                fixed throughout the crediting periods, the DOE shall determine whether the\n                identification of all data sources and assumptions are appropriate and applicable\n                to the generic CP, and will result in an accurate or otherwise conservative estimate\n                of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals. If the applied methodologies\n                require that any of these data and parameters be determined in accordance with\n                the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the\n                Supervisory Body, the DOE shall determine whether the generic CP-DD states the\n                necessity of conducting such sampling in accordance with this standard;\n        (b)     Data and parameters to be monitored: If data and parameters will be monitored\n                or estimated on implementation of corresponding CPs and hence become\n                available only after the inclusion of corresponding CPs, the DOE shall determine\n                whether the modalities for estimation of these data and parameters provided in the\n                generic CP-DD are reasonable. If the applied methodologies require that any of\n                these estimates be determined in accordance with the standard for sampling and\n\n\n\n                                                  23 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body, the DOE shall\n                determine whether the generic CP-DD states the necessity of conducting such\n                sampling in accordance with this standard.\n102.    For projects involving removals that also result in emission reductions, the DOE shall\n        assess whether the estimation of removals and emission reductions is separated and that\n        it was undertaken in accordance with the applied methodology(ies) applicable to the\n        generic CP.\n103.    The DOE shall determine whether, in the generic CP-DD, the steps taken to calculate the\n        difference between baseline emissions and BAU emissions for each year of the crediting\n        period and the total amount over the crediting period to determine a downward adjustment\n        based on BAU are in compliance with relevant provisions of the activity standard, the\n        methodologies standard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological\n        regulatory documents.\n104.    The DOE shall assess whether the approach to determining whether the baseline shall be\n        adjusted downward, was applied in compliance with the requirements of the activity\n        standard, respective provisions of the methodologies standard, applied methodologies\n        and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n105.    The DOE shall determine whether the approach to determine leakage emissions in the\n        generic CP-DD is in accordance with activity standard and relevant applied methodologies\n        and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n106.    The DOE shall also assess whether the approaches for avoiding or minimizing and\n        accounting for leakage emissions are in line with the respective requirements of the activity\n        standard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n107.    The DOE shall describe the steps taken to assess the requirements and state its opinion\n        on whether:\n        (a)     All assumptions and data used by the activity participants are listed in the generic\n                CP-DD, including their references and sources;\n        (b)     All documentation used by the activity participants as the basis for assumptions\n                and sources of data are correctly quoted and interpreted in the generic CP-DD;\n        (c)     All values used in the generic CP-DD, including GWPs, are considered reasonable\n                in the context of the generic CP;\n        (d)     The methodologies, standardized baselines and other methodological regulatory\n                documents have been applied correctly to describe how to calculate baseline,\n                project and leakage GHG emissions as well as GHG emission reductions or net\n                GHG removals for corresponding CPs;\n        (e)     Modalities to estimate the baseline GHG emissions or GHG removals can be\n                replicated using the data and parameter values provided in the generic CP-DD;\n        (f)     The necessity of conducting sampling in accordance with the standard for sampling\n                and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body is stated,\n                where the applied methodologies require that the data and parameters be\n                determined in accordance with this standard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n108.

Validation of the monitoring plan\n109.    The DOE shall determine whether the description of how to develop a monitoring plan for\n        each of the corresponding CPs complies with the requirements of the activity standard,\n        the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents and, where applicable, the standard for sampling\n        and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n110.

Validation for inclusion of component projects\n7.1.    General validation requirements\n121.    The DOE contracted by the activity participants to validate a proposed CP for inclusion in\n        a registered A6.4 PoA shall be accredited for the validation function and in the sectoral\n        scope(s) relevant to the CP.\n122.    The DOE shall apply the objectives, approach and means of validation in section 6.1\n        above, mutatis mutandis, when validating a proposed CP for inclusion in a registered A6.4\n        PoA.\n123.    The DOE shall assess whether the proposed CP complies with the corresponding generic\n        CP-DD in the latest version of the registered PoA-DD, including the eligibility criteria for\n        the inclusion of CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA and relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n        and requirements.\n124.    If the activity participants have chosen to delay the submission of the monitoring plan for\n        the proposed CP in accordance with the activity standard, the DOE shall confirm and\n        document that the monitoring plan is delayed.\n125.    It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at validation for the proposed\n        CP if:\n        (a)     Its estimated annual average of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals is\n                more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (t CO2 eq); or\n        (b)     There is pre-project information that is relevant to the requirements for inclusion of\n                the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA and may not be traceable after the inclusion.\n126.    For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 125 above, it is optional for the DOE to\n        conduct an on-site inspection at validation. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site\n        inspection as a means of validation, it shall describe the alternative means used and justify\n        that they are sufficient for the purpose of validation.\n\n7.2.    General description of component project\n127.    The DOE shall assess the CP-DD submitted by the activity participants and confirm that\n        the proposed CP has:\n        (a)     Only one host Party;\n        (b)     Its geographic reference or other means of identification;\n        (c)     An entity(ies)/individual(s) responsible for the operation of the CP;\n        (d)     Been neither registered as an A6.4 project nor included in another registered A6.4\n                PoA.\n128.    The DOE shall determine whether the description of the proposed CP in the CP-DD is\n        accurate and complete, and provides an understanding of the proposed CP.\n129.    The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in\n        section 7.1 above, whether the proposed CP is consistent with the generic CP and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        complies with all relevant requirements for inclusion in the registered A6.4 PoA as\n        contained in the activity standard, including the requirements on:\n        (a)     The compliance with the host Party’s indication of activity types that it would\n                approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs;\n        (b)     The description of the CP;\n        (c)     The avoidance of double or revived registration;\n        (d)     The selection of methodologies and standardized baselines and their applicability\n                to the CP;\n        (e)     The deviation from, or revision of, the selected methodology or methodological\n                tool, if applicable;\n        (f)     The application of methodologies and standardized baselines, including in terms\n                of:\n                (i)     The applicability conditions;\n                (ii)    The definition of the project boundary, identification of sources, sinks and\n                        GHGs included in the project boundary, and identification of leakage;\n                (iii)   The identification of baseline scenario;\n                (iv)    The demonstration of additionality;\n                (v)     The assessment of the risk of non-permanence of GHG emission reductions\n                        or net GHG removals and measures to address reversals if they occur;\n                (vi)    The estimation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (vii) The monitoring plan;\n        (g)     The specification of the start date, crediting period type and duration;\n        (h)     The analysis of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable\n                development impacts;\n        (i)     Integrity safeguards;\n        (j)     Local or subnational stakeholder consultation;\n        (k)     The eligibility of inclusion.\n130.    When validating the compliance of the proposed CP with the requirements for inclusion in\n        the registered A6.4 PoA referred to in paragraph 129 above, the DOE shall additionally\n        follow the specific guidance on validation regarding some of these requirements provided\n        in sections 7.3–7.12 below.\n\n7.3.    Compliance with the host Party’s indication of activity types\n131.    The DOE shall determine whether the proposed CP complies with the activity types that\n        the host Party has indicated publicly to the Supervisory Body that it would consider\n        approving pursuant to chapter V.C (Approval and authorization) of the RMPs and in\n        accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n\n\n\n                                                  29 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n7.4.    Description of component project\n132.    The DOE shall describe the process undertaken to validate the accuracy and\n        completeness of the description of the proposed CP in the CP-DD and state its opinion on\n        the accuracy and completeness of the description.\n\n7.5.    Avoidance of double or revived registration\n133.    The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirement relating to double or revived\n        registration contained in the activity standard based on the publicly available information\n        and/or the information provided by the activity participants upon its request.\n\n7.6.    Selection of methodologies and standardized baselines\n134.    The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are compatible with\n        the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party in accordance\n        with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable.\n135.    If the DOE, based on local and sectoral knowledge, is aware that comparable information\n        is available from credible sources other than those used in the CP-DD, it shall cross-check\n        the CP-DD against such other sources to confirm that the proposed CP meets the\n        applicability conditions of the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n136.    The DOE shall determine whether the proposed CP has selected the standardized\n        baselines where their selection is mandatory.\n137.    If the DOE cannot determine the applicability of the selected methodology, methodological\n        tool and/or standardized baseline to the proposed CP, the DOE shall request a clarification\n        on the applicability in accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and\n        clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and/or the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.\n\n7.6.1. Deviation from methodology or methodological tool\n138.    The DOE may seek a clarification from the Supervisory Body on the acceptability of a\n        deviation from the selected methodology or methodological tool in accordance with the\n        “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological\n        tools” prior to the inclusion of the proposed CP, if the DOE, when performing validation for\n        the inclusion of the CP in the registered A6.4 PoA, or upon request from the activity\n        participants, finds that, due to a project-specific13 issue implying that a revision of the\n\n13 Examples of project-specific issues include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n  (a)   The methodology requires measurements using instrumentation of certain specifications or using a\n        certain method. The activity participants of the proposed CP face a difficulty in acquiring the\n        specified instrumentation or a difficulty in implementing the measurement method; however, they\n        can achieve comparable accuracy of measured parameters using an alternative instrumentation or\n        measurement method;\n  (b)   A proposed CP does not have access to the data sources specified by the methodology for a certain\n        parameter; a different source of data can be accessed by the CP to estimate the parameter with\n        equal reliability and accuracy;\n\n\n\n\n                                                   30 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        methodology and/or methodological tool would not be required to address the issue, the\n        CP deviated from:\n        (a)     The selected methodology or methodological tool; or\n        (b)     Sections in the selected methodology or methodological tool that are not\n                standardized by the selected standardized baselines, if the proposed CP applies\n                standardized baselines.\n139.    The DOE shall submit an assessment of the case including demonstration that the\n        deviation does not require revision of the selected methodology or methodological tool,\n        and shall include a description of the impact of the deviation on GHG emission reductions\n        or net GHG removals by the CP.\n140.    Alternatively, if the DOE considers that a revision of the selected methodology or\n        methodological tool would be required to address the project situation, then the DOE shall\n        submit, or shall request the activity participants to submit, a request for revision of the\n        selected methodology or methodological tool in accordance with the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” and,\n        upon its revision, proceed with a request for post-registration changes to the registered\n        A6.4 PoA to apply the revised version.\n\n7.7.    Application of methodologies and standardized baselines\n\n7.7.1. Host Party methodological requirements\n141.    The DOE shall determine whether the selected methodologies, the selected standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents are applied in a way\n        to comply with the methodological requirements that may be specified by the host Party\n        in accordance with paragraph 27(a) of the RMPs, if applicable.\n\n7.7.2. Project boundary, sources, leakage and greenhouse gases\n142.    If the applied methodologies and the applied standardized baselines allow the activity\n        participants to choose whether a GHG source or gas is to be included within the project\n        boundary, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have justified that\n        choice and whether the justification provided is reasonable.\n143.    If the DOE identifies GHG emission sources that will be affected by the implementation of\n        the CP and which are expected to contribute more than 1 per cent of the overall expected\n        average annual GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, and are not addressed\n        by the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines, the DOE shall\n\n\n  (c)   A minor deviation is sought for a project-specific situation, which is well justified and conservative.\n        For example: a methodology requires limiting production in the project scenario between +/- 5 per\n        cent of rated capacity, if the historical baseline is to be applied. Due to government restrictions, the\n        plant has never been operated at its rated capacity but at a capacity which is much below its rated\n        capacity (20 per cent below the rated capacity). A deviation can be presented specifying\n        conservative approaches to calculate the emission reduction in such a project-specific case;\n  (d)   A conservative estimation technique or default factor suggested addressing uncertainties related to\n        project-specific situations, which are not addressed in the methodology, for example, a well-justified\n        conservative uncertainty factor proposed to be used in equations of baseline emissions to address\n        uncertainties in the real-life situation during the crediting period.\n\n\n\n                                                   31 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        request a clarification of, revision to, or deviation from, the methodologies or the\n        standardized baselines, as appropriate, in accordance with the “Procedure: Development,\n        revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological tools” or the “Procedure:\n        Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.\n\n7.7.3. Baseline scenario\n144.    If the applied methodologies require several alternative scenarios to be considered in the\n        identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, the DOE shall, based on its expertise\n        and local and sectoral knowledge, determine whether all scenarios that are considered by\n        the activity participants and any scenarios that are supplementary to those required by the\n        methodologies are realistic and credible in the context of the proposed CP and that no\n        alternative scenario has been excluded. The DOE shall assess whether a more ambitious\n        baseline requirement, as determined by the host Party and approved by the Supervisory\n        Body, has been applied in the identification of the most plausible baseline scenario, if\n        applicable.\n145.    The DOE shall determine whether the most plausible baseline scenario identified is\n        reasonable by validating the assumptions, calculations and rationales used in the CP-DD.\n146.    Notwithstanding paragraphs 144 and 145 above, if the proposed CP applies an approved\n        standardized baseline that standardizes the baseline scenario, the DOE shall determine\n        whether the baseline scenario for the CP is the scenario specified by the applied\n        standardized baseline.\n7.7.4. Business-as-usual scenario or benchmark\n147.    The DOE shall assess whether the identification and the description in the CP-DD of the\n        BAU scenario or reference benchmark emissions comply with the requirements of the\n        activity standard, applied methodologies and other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents.\n\n7.7.5. Demonstration of additionality\n148.

The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in\n        sections 5 and 6.1 above, mutatis mutandis, and section 8.1 above, whether the proposed\n        or actual post-registration changes to the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP falls\n        within one of the following types of changes that may be allowed and complies with the\n        respective requirements for post-registration changes contained in the activity standard:\n        (a)     Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms\n                (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4\n                Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable\n                development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other\n                methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;\n        (b)     Permanent changes:\n                (i)     Corrections;\n                (ii)    Inclusion of a monitoring plan;\n                (iii)   Changes to the start date of the crediting period of the included CP;\n                (iv)    Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan, to the A6.4 SD Tool\n                        forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form,\n                        A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable\n                        development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring from the\n                        applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other methodological\n                        regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool;\n                (v)     Changes to the PoA or CP design;\n        (c)     Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme.\n190.    When validating the compliance of the proposed or actual post-registration changes with\n        the relevant requirements for post-registration changes, the DOE shall additionally follow\n        the specific guidance on validation for some types of post-registration changes provided\n        in sections 8.2.2‒8.2.3 below.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  39 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2. Temporary deviations from the registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms\n       (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4\n       Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable\n       development impact form), applied methodologies, standardized baselines or other\n       methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool\n191.    The DOE shall determine whether there is a temporary deviation from the monitoring plan\n        in the included CP-DD (hereinafter referred to as the registered monitoring plan), the A6.4\n        SD Tool forms (A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4\n        Sustainable development impact form), the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory documents,\n        including the A6.4 SD Tool and, if there is, the DOE shall determine whether the temporary\n        deviation complies with the relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n192.    If the DOE identifies that the activity participants have temporarily deviated from the\n        registered monitoring plan, the A6.4 SD Tool forms (A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form\n        and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form), the applied methodologies, the A6.4 SD\n        Tool, the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have described the\n        nature, extent and duration of the non-conforming monitoring period, and proposed\n        alternative monitoring arrangements or applied the most conservative values approach\n        referred to in the activity standard for the non-conforming monitoring period.\n193.    If the DOE determines that the activity participants have proposed alternative monitoring\n        arrangements for the non-conforming monitoring period, it shall determine whether the\n        arrangements apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the calculations to\n        the extent required to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals will not\n        be overestimated as a result of the deviation.\n194.    If the deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the\n        applied standardized baselines is applicable to the monitoring period under verification\n        and part of the previous or subsequent monitoring period, the DOE shall determine the\n        exact period to which the deviation applies.\n195.    The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the deviation complies with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard.\n\n8.2.3. Permanent changes\n\n8.2.3.1.        Corrections\n196.    If the activity participants have made corrections to the project information or parameters\n        fixed at the registration of the A6.4 PoA or inclusion of the CP as described in the\n        registered PoA-DD or CP-DD, the DOE shall determine whether:\n        (a)     The activity participants documented them in a revised PoA-DD or CP-DD;\n        (b)     The corrected information is an accurate reflection of actual project information;\n                and/or\n        (c)     The corrected parameters are in accordance with the applied methodologies, the\n                registered monitoring plan, the applied standardized baselines and the other\n                applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n\n\n                                                  40 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n197.    The DOE shall state how the corrected information accurately reflects the actual\n        information or how the corrected parameters reflect the application of the applied\n        methodologies, the registered monitoring plan, the applied standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n8.2.3.2.        Changes to the start date of the crediting period of a component project\n198.    If the activity participants wish to change the start date of the crediting period of an\n        included CP, the DOE shall determine whether the proposed change complies with the\n        relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n199.    The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the change complies with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity standard.\n\n8.2.3.3.        Inclusion of monitoring plan\n200.    If the activity participants chose to omit a monitoring plan at the inclusion of the CP and\n        wish to include it thereafter, the DOE shall determine whether the design of the monitoring\n        plan and other sections of the CP-DD comply with the relevant requirements in the activity\n        standard and in accordance with the relevant requirements contained in section 7.7.8\n        above.\n201.    The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the monitoring plan in the revised CP-DD\n        complies with the relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n\n8.2.3.4.        Permanent changes to the registered monitoring plan and/or A6.4 SD Tool\n                forms (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form,\n                A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable\n                development impact form), or permanent deviation of monitoring from the\n                applied methodologies, standardized baselines, or other applied\n                methodological regulatory documents, including the A6.4 SD Tool\n202.    If the activity participants wish to make a permanent change to the registered monitoring\n        plan, or if the monitoring permanently deviates from the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines, or the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents, the DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have described the\n        nature and extent of the non-conforming monitoring and the proposed alternative\n        monitoring for the CP in the revised CP-DD, the permanent changes or deviation, and\n        whether the proposed alternative monitoring complies with the relevant requirements in\n        the activity standard.\n203.    The DOE shall determine whether the permanent change to the registered monitoring plan\n        in the revised CP-DD is in line with the description in the generic CP-DD in the registered\n        PoA-DD of how to develop the monitoring plan for each of the corresponding CPs and is\n        in compliance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n204.    If the DOE determines that the permanent change or the permanent deviation described\n        in the revised CP-DD is not in line with the description in the generic CP-DD in the\n        registered PoA-DD of how to develop the monitoring plan for each of the corresponding\n        CPs, the DOE shall request the activity participants to prepare a revised PoA-DD to\n        accommodate the permanent changes or permanent deviation for approval by the\n        Supervisory Body first. Upon such revision of the PoA-DD, the DOE shall determine\n\n\n\n                                                  41 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        whether the revised description is in compliance with the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents. If the revised description deviates from them, the DOE shall determine\n        whether the conservative assumptions or discount factors are applied.\n205.    The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the registered monitoring\n        plan or the permanent deviation of the monitoring from the applied methodologies, the\n        applied standardized baselines, or other applied methodological regulatory documents are\n        likely to lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation of GHG emission reductions\n        or net GHG removals. If the DOE considers that the permanent changes or the permanent\n        deviation will lead to a reduction in the accuracy of the calculation, the DOE shall request\n        the activity participants to apply conservative assumptions or discount factors to the\n        calculations to the extent required to ensure that GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals will not be overestimated as a result of the permanent change or the permanent\n        deviation.\n206.    The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the permanent changes or the permanent\n        deviation comply with the relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n207.    The DOE shall determine whether the permanent changes to the A6.4 SD Tool forms\n        (A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental\n        and social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form),\n        provided as part of the revised CP-DD are in compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool and\n        relevant provisions of the activity standard.\n208.    For component projects involving removals and emission reduction component projects\n        with reversal risks, the DOE shall determine whether the monitoring plan and the risk\n        assessment plan were reviewed and updated every five years and in the circumstances\n        specified in paragraph 153 above, in accordance with relevant provisions of the activity\n        standard, removals standard and other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n8.2.3.5.        Changes to the programme or project design\n209.    If the activity participants wish to make a proposed change or have made an actual change\n        to the design of a registered A6.4 PoA or to the design of an included CP, the DOE shall\n        determine whether the change complies with the relevant requirements in the activity\n        standard.\n210.    The DOE shall determine whether the change to the design of the registered A6.4 PoA is\n        for one or more of the following purposes:\n        (a)     To expand the programmes’ boundary to expand the geographic coverage or to\n                include additional host Parties;\n        (b)     To remove a methodology and/or standardized baseline from the registered\n                PoA-DD;\n        (c)     To change the capacity range specified in the registered PoA-DD;\n        (d)     To change the design of the PoA;\n        (e)     To add new components or extend/add technologies/measures, provided that they\n                comply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that the host Party would approve in\n                accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs;\n\n\n\n                                                  42 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n          (f)     To remove a component or technology/measure described in the registered PoA-\n                  DD;\n          (g)     To change the technologies/measures specified in the registered PoA-DD;\n          (h)     To change a generic CP to:\n                  (i)    Apply an applicable and valid standardized baseline to determine baseline\n                         emissions or parameter values;\n                  (ii)   Switch from an ex post to an ex ante determination of parameter values for\n                         calculating baseline emissions using a standardized baseline;\n          (i)     To make any consequential changes to the application of methodologies and/or\n                  the standardized baselines resulting from the changes referred to in\n                  subparagraphs (b)− (h) above;\n          (j)     To voluntarily update the applied methodologies to a later valid version of the same\n                  methodologies, or to change to another methodology;15\n          (k)     To make any consequential changes to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in\n                  the registered A6.4 PoA, resulting from the changes referred to in subparagraphs\n                  (a)− (j) above;\n211.      If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to expand the geographic coverage or to\n          include additional host Parties, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:\n          (a)     The registered PoA-DD has been revised to reflect the changes, in particular the\n                  eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs;\n          (b)     The baseline setting described in the relevant generic CP in the PoA-DD is\n                  applicable to the expanded PoA boundary;\n          (c)     In the case of inclusion of additional host Parties, each DNA of the new host Parties\n                  has provided an approval of the PoA in accordance with section 6.2.11 above, and\n                  confirmed that the host Party and the other participating Party, if applicable, have\n                  provided authorization of activity participants in accordance with section 6.2.12\n                  above.\n212.      If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to revise the eligibility criteria for the\n          inclusion of CPs, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:\n          (a)     The revision of the eligibility criteria complies with the provisions and conditions set\n                  out in the activity standard. If the revision does not fall under any of the categories\n                  specified in the activity standard, the DOE shall direct the activity participants to\n                  seek guidance from the Supervisory Body on the appropriateness of the revision\n                  in accordance with the “Procedure: Consideration of unsolicited letters to the\n                  Supervisory Body”;\n\n\n15   As per the activity cycle procedure, it is not mandatory for activity participants to apply a revised version\n     of the methodology that is different from the version applied for the registration of the PoA. However,\n     the activity cycle procedure also specifies that no new CPs can be included in the PoA until a post-\n     registration change to the PoA to reflect the requirements of the new version of the methodology is\n     approved by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n                                                     43 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     The revised eligibility criteria meet the requirements of the methodologies and the\n                standardized baselines that are applied in the PoA;\n        (c)     The registered PoA-DD is revised appropriately to reflect the revised eligibility\n                criteria for inclusion of CPs.\n213.    If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to remove a methodology and/or\n        standardized baseline, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:\n        (a)     The change only involves the removal and no addition of a methodology and/or\n                standardized baseline;\n        (b)     The removal of the methodology and/or the standardized baseline does not affect\n                the physical design of, and the end-use service provided by, the CPs that apply\n                the methodologies and the standardized baselines that remain (i.e. the\n                methodologies and the standardized baselines that were not removed).\n214.    If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to change the design of the PoA such that\n        it may result in an increase of the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions\n        or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the PoA through the inclusion and\n        implementation of CPs, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:\n        (a)     The registered PoA-DD has been revised to reflect the changes;\n        (b)     The DNA(s) of respective host Party(ies) have provided approval in accordance\n                with the relevant requirements in the activity cycle procedure.\n215.    If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to change the capacity range specified in\n        the generic CP-DD in the registered PoA-DD, the DOE shall assess and confirm that the\n        change does not disqualify the applicability of the applied methodologies, applied\n        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n216.    If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to add new components or extend/add\n        technologies/measures, provided that they comply with the types of Article 6.4 activity that\n        the host Party would approve in accordance with paragraph 26(e) of the RMPs, the DOE\n        shall assess and confirm that the change introduces complementary\n        technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy transfer to/from the original\n        technologies/measures.\n217.    If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to remove a component or\n        technology/measure described in the generic CP-DD in the registered PoA-DD, the DOE\n        shall assess and confirm that the removal of the component or technology/measure does\n        not remove the applicability of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n        baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n218.    If the registered A6.4 PoA has been amended to change the technologies/measures\n        specified in the generic CP-DD in the registered PoA-DD, the DOE shall assess and\n        confirm that the change only results in the same technologies/measures as in the\n        registered technologies/measures as per the definition of “the same technologies” in the\n        activity standard.\n219.    The DOE shall assess whether any change to the registered A6.4 PoA may result in an\n        increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals expected to be achieved by the PoA, and if positive, such increase is clearly\n        indicated in the revised PoA-DD.\n\n\n\n                                                  44 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n220.    If the design of an included CP has been changed, the DOE shall assess and confirm that:\n        (a)     The reason for the increase in the capacity, if applicable, is not within the control\n                of the activity participants. If the reason is within the control, the revised estimation\n                of GHG emission reductions due to the change is within the applicable limit allowed\n                in accordance with the activity standard;\n        (b)     The increase or decrease in the capacity specified in the included CP-DD falls\n                within the capacity range of the generic CP;\n        (c)     The new components or extended/added technologies/measures are covered by\n                the generic CP in the registered PoA-DD and introduce complementary\n                technologies/measures involving mass and/or energy transfer to/from the\n                technologies/measures described in the included CP-DD;\n        (d)     The modified/changed technologies/measures are covered by the generic CP and\n                result in the same technologies/measures as in the included CP-DD as per the\n                definition of “the same technologies” in the activity standard;\n        (e)     The included CP with the changes is within the scope of the generic CP;\n        (f)     The eligibility criteria for these technologies/measures are specified in the generic\n                CP;\n        (g)     The change does not result in an increase in the maximum annual amount of GHG\n                emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be achieved by the PoA,\n                otherwise the DOE shall request the activity participants to proceed first with a\n                post-registration change to the registered PoA-DD to reflect the change of\n                increasing the maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                removals expected to be achieved by the registered A6.4 PoA in which the CP is\n                included.\n221.    If the DOE establishes that the change of the design of the included CP, involving capacity\n        increase or addition of a new technology or measure, results in exceeding the maximum\n        annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals expected to be\n        achieved by the registered A6.4 PoA in which the CP is included, the DOE shall confirm\n        whether:\n        (a)     A post-registration change to the registered PoA-DD has also been proposed by\n                the activity participants to reflect the change of increasing the maximum annual\n                amount;\n        (b)     The DNA of the host Party of the PoA for which the maximum annual amount has\n                been increased has provided an approval of the increase in accordance with the\n                activity cycle procedure.\n222.    When conducting the validations referred to in paragraphs 215−220 above, in case of\n        actual changes, the DOE shall, by means of an on-site inspection (where conducted in\n        accordance with paragraph 125 or 126 above) and a review of the revised PoA-DD or CP-\n        DD submitted by the activity participants that describes the nature and extent of the actual\n        changes, determine whether this description accurately reflects the implementation,\n        operation and monitoring of the modified A6.4 PoA or included CP.\n223.    When conducting the validations referred to in paragraphs 215−220 above, by means of\n        an on-site inspection or other means of validation carried out in accordance with paragraph\n\n\n\n                                                  45 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        125 or 126 above, the DOE shall assess the impacts of the actual changes on the\n        monitoring plan, the level of accuracy of the monitoring activity, the applied methodologies,\n        the applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n        documents.\n224.    The DOE shall, by means of reviewing the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD against applicable\n        additionality and other methodological requirements, determine whether the proposed or\n        actual change would adversely affect the conclusions of the validation report on the\n        registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP with regard to:\n        (a)     The applicability and application of the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents with which the PoA or CP has been registered or included;\n        (b)     The compliance of the monitoring plan with the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents;\n        (c)     The level of accuracy and completeness of the monitoring for the PoA or the CP;\n        (d)     The additionality of the PoA or CP;\n        (e)     Compliance with the A6.4 SD Tool;\n        (f)     The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA.\n225.    If the DOE determines that the proposed or actual change affects the additionality of the\n        registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP, the DOE shall determine whether the\n        demonstration of the impacts of the changes on the additionality is based on all original\n        input data.\n226.    Notwithstanding paragraph 225 above, if the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP uses\n        an approved standardized baseline that standardizes additionality, and if the proposed or\n        actual change affects the additionality of the PoA or the included CP, the DOE shall\n        determine whether the demonstration of the impacts of the change on the additionality is\n        based on the additionality criteria identified in the applied standardized baseline.\n227.    The DOE shall assess whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD complies with all the\n        requirements of the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n228.    If the activity participants have voluntarily updated the applied methodologies and/or\n        standardized baselines to a later valid version of them, or changed to other methodologies\n        or standardized baselines, the DOE shall confirm that the revised PoA-DD meets all\n        requirements of the updated/changed methodologies, including the standards,\n        methodological tools and guidelines applied in accordance with the updated/changed\n        methodologies and/or the updated/changed standardized baselines.\n229.    If the changes to the programme or project design affect the identification, assessment or\n        monitoring of environmental, social or sustainable development impacts, the DOE shall\n        assess whether the impacts caused by the changes were assessed and revised versions\n        of the A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4\n        Environmental and social management plan form (if applicable) and A6.4 Sustainable\n        development impact form were provided.

The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the proposed or actual change complies with\n        the relevant requirements in the activity standard.\n231.    The DOE shall state its opinion on:\n        (a)     A description of the proposed or actual change as compared to the description in\n                the registered PoA-DD or CP-DD;\n        (b)     An assessment of when the change occurred or will occur, reasons for the change\n                taking place, whether the change would have been known prior to the registration\n                of the A6.4 PoA or the inclusion of the CP, how the change would impact the overall\n                operation/ability of the PoA or CP to deliver GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                removals as stated in the PoA-DD or CP-DD, and whether the revised estimation\n                of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals due to the changes are within\n                the applicable limits allowed in accordance with the activity standard;\n        (c)     An assessment of whether the change would adversely affect the conclusions of\n                the validation report on the registered A6.4 PoA or the included CP with regard to:\n                (i)     The applicability and application of: (1) the applied methodologies, the\n                        applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological\n                        regulatory documents with which the PoA or the CP has been registered or\n                        included; (2) the later valid version of the applied methodologies, the applied\n                        standardized baselines and/or the other applied methodological regulatory\n                        documents or other methodologies and/or standardized baselines that the\n                        PoA or the CP has been updated/changed to;\n                (ii)    The project boundary of the CP and any associated leakages due to the\n                        changes;\n                (iii)   The compliance of the revised monitoring plan with the applied\n                        methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n                        methodological regulatory documents;\n                (iv)    The level of accuracy and completeness in the monitoring of the PoA or the\n                        CP compared with the requirements contained in the registered monitoring\n                        plan;\n                (v)     The additionality of the PoA or the CP;\n                (vi)    Compliance with SD Tool;\n                (vii) The eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the PoA.\n232.    In validating the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD containing the proposed or actual change, and\n        in preparing the opinion, the DOE shall include the information on how:\n\n\n\n\n                                                  47 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n         (a)      The proposed revision ensures that the level of accuracy and completeness16 in\n                  the monitoring and verification process is not reduced as a result of the revision.\n                  The DOE shall, using objective evidence, assess the accuracy and completeness\n                  of each proposed change to the registered monitoring plan, including the frequency\n                  of measurements, the quality of monitoring equipment (e.g. calibration\n                  requirements) and the quality assurance and quality control procedures;\n         (b)      The proposed revision complies with all requirements of:\n                  (i)     The applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the\n                          other applied methodological regulatory documents; or\n                  (ii)    The updated/changed methodologies, including the standards,\n                          methodological tools and guidelines applied in accordance with the\n                          updated/changed methodologies, and/or the updated/changed standardized\n                          baselines, if the applied methodologies and/or standardized baselines have\n                          been voluntarily updated to a later valid version of them or changed to other\n                          methodologies or standardized baselines;\n                  (iii)   The findings of previous verification and certification reports, if any, have\n                          been taken into account.\n\n8.2.3.6.          Change of activity participant\n233.     If, subsequent to the registration of the A6.4 PoA, the activity participants have been\n         changed, either the DOE undertaking the next inclusion of a proposed CP, or the DOE\n         that submits the next request for issuance of Article 6.4 emission reductions (A6.4ERs) for\n         the PoA, or the DOE that submits the next post-registration change request for the PoA,\n         whichever is earlier, shall determine whether the new activity participant has been\n         authorized by the host Party of, or any other participating Party in, the PoA in accordance\n         with the activity cycle procedure.\n234.     The DOE shall submit the validation opinion to the secretariat in accordance with the\n         activity cycle procedure.\n235.     Notwithstanding the timing referred to in paragraph 233 above, the DOE shall submit the\n         validation opinion to the secretariat in accordance with the activity cycle procedure if the\n         activity participants wish the DOE to do so before the next inclusion of a proposed CP, the\n         next request for issuance of A6.4ERs or the next post-registration change request for the\n         PoA.\n\n8.2.4. Registration under or overlap with other crediting scheme\n236.     The DOE shall determine the compliance with the requirements relating to registration or\n         coverage by a programme, under any other international, regional, national, or subnational\n         or sector-wide GHG mitigation crediting scheme contained in the activity standard based\n         on the publicly available information and/or the information provided by the activity\n         participants upon its request.\n\n16   Completeness refers to inclusion of all relevant information for assessment of GHG emission reductions\n     and the information supporting the methods applied as required. For example, if the DOE identifies an\n     on-site generator for emergency use which was not included in the registered monitoring plan during\n     the verification process, the monitoring of fuel consumption of this generator should be included in the\n     monitoring plan\n\n\n\n                                                   48 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n8.3.    Validation report\n237.    In its validation report for the post-registration changes, the DOE shall:\n        (a)     Report on all items listed in paragraph 120 above except for its subparagraph\n                120(g) above;\n        (b)     Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusion on the assessment of:\n                (i)     Whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD is prepared using the valid version\n                        of the applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable;\n                (ii)    Whether the information transferred to the later valid version of the PoA-DD\n                        or CP-DD form is materially the same as that in the registered PoA-DD or\n                        CP-DD, as applicable;\n                (iii)   Whether the revised PoA-DD or CP-DD is prepared in both track-change and\n                        clean versions;\n                (iv)    Whether the revised A6.4 Environmental and social safeguards risk\n                        assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form\n                        and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form are prepared using the valid\n                        version of the applicable forms and following the instructions therein, as\n                        applicable;\n                (v)     The compliance of the proposed or actual post-registration changes with the\n                        requirement for post-registration changes conducted in accordance with\n                        sections 8.1–8.2 above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the\n                        activity participants and how they have been addressed by them.\n238.    The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the validation outcome, containing:\n        (a)     A positive validation opinion and the date of submission of the validation report as\n                part of the request for approval of post-registration changes to the secretariat; or\n        (b)     A negative validation opinion, including the reasons for the post-registration\n                changes as documented having been determined as not complying with the\n                relevant requirements for post-registration changes.\n\n9.      Verification of implementation and monitoring\n9.1.    Objective of verification\n239.    The DOE shall conduct a thorough and independent assessment of the implementation\n        and the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by a registered\n        A6.4 PoA and the included CPs against the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism rules and\n        requirements.\n\n9.1.1. Overarching requirements\n240.    The DOE shall assess and determine whether the implementation and operation of the\n        registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs, and the steps taken to report GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals, comply with the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules\n        and requirements. This assessment shall involve a review of relevant documentation as\n\n\n\n                                                  49 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n         well as, where conducted in accordance with paragraphs 264–265 below, an on-site\n         inspection(s). For an on-site inspection(s), the DOE may apply a sampling approach in\n         accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for A6.4 activities to be developed\n         by the Supervisory Body.\n241.     The DOE shall assess whether the data collection system meets the requirements of the\n         registered monitoring plan as per the applied methodologies, the applied standardized\n         baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n242.     The DOE shall:\n         (a)      Determine whether the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs have been\n                  implemented and are operating in accordance with the registered PoA-DD and CP-\n                  DDs;\n         (b)      Determine whether GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals have been\n                  monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plan(s).\n\n9.1.2. Other requirements\n243.     The DOE shall assess both quantitative and qualitative information on GHG emission\n         reductions or net GHG removals provided in the monitoring report.17\n244.     In addition to the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall review:\n         (a)      The registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs, including the registered monitoring plan(s)\n                  and/or the changes to the registered PoA-DD or CP-DDs, and the corresponding\n                  validation opinions;\n         (b)      The validation report;\n         (c)      Previous verification and certification reports, if any;\n         (d)      The applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other\n                  applied methodological regulatory documents;\n         (e)      The monitoring results of environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable\n                  development impacts of the included CPs;\n         (f)      Any other information and references relevant to the GHG emission reductions or\n                  net GHG removals achieved by the included CPs (e.g. Intergovernmental Panel\n                  on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, data on electricity generation in the national\n                  grid or laboratory analysis, national regulations).\n245.     In addition to reviewing the monitoring documentation, the DOE shall determine whether\n         the activity participants have addressed the FARs identified during the previous validation\n         or verification.\n\n\n\n\n17   Quantitative information comprises the reported numbers in the monitoring report. Qualitative\n     information comprises information on internal management controls, calculation procedures, procedures\n     for transfer of data, frequency of the monitoring reports, and review and internal audit of calculations.\n\n\n\n                                                   50 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3. Quality of evidence\n246.     When verifying the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the DOE\n         shall confirm that there is an audit trail that contains the evidence and records that validate\n         or invalidate the stated figures. The audit trail shall include the source documents that form\n         the basis for assumptions and other information underlying the GHG data.\n247.     When assessing the audit trail, the DOE shall:\n         (a)     Address whether there is sufficient evidence available, both in terms of frequency\n                 (time period between evidence) and coverage (in covering the full monitoring\n                 period);\n         (b)     Address the source and nature of the evidence (external or internal, oral or\n                 documented);\n         (c)     Cross-check the monitoring report against other sources, such as comparable\n                 information, where available, from sources other than those used in the monitoring\n                 report, to determine whether the stated figures are correct.\n248.     The DOE shall only certify GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that are based\n         on verifiable evidence.\n\n9.1.4. Application of materiality\n\n9.1.4.1.         General\n249.     The concept of materiality is applicable to the verification of monitored GHG emission\n         reductions or net GHG removals achieved by all types of registered A6.4 PoAs. It is not\n         applicable to:\n         (a)     Uncertainties related to measurement;\n         (b)     Addressing temporary deviations and permanent changes to the registered\n                 monitoring plan, the applied methodologies or the applied standardized baselines,\n                 regardless of whether the corresponding GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                 removals are above or below materiality thresholds.\n250.     A DOE that plans and conducts verification using the concept of materiality shall achieve\n         a reasonable level of assurance that the reported GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n         removals are free from material errors, omissions or misstatements in accordance with\n         paragraphs 251−261 below.\n251.     An omission, misstatement, or erroneous reporting of information is material if it might\n         lead, at an aggregated level, to an overestimation of the total GHG emission reductions or\n         net GHG removals achieved by a registered A6.4 PoA equal to or higher than the following\n         thresholds:\n         (a)     0.5 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for registered A6.4 PoAs\n                 achieving a total emission reduction or removal equal to or more than 500,000 t\n                 CO2 eq per year;18\n\n\n\n18   A year refers to a period of 12 consecutive months.\n\n\n\n                                                  51 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (b)     1 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for registered A6.4 PoAs\n                achieving a total emission reduction or removal of between 300,000 and\n                500,000 t CO2 eq per year;\n        (c)     2 per cent of the emission reductions or removals for registered A6.4 PoAs\n                achieving a total emission reduction or removal of 300,000 t CO2 eq per year or\n                less.\n252.    Recognizing that circumstances may exist that could cause the information reported by\n        the activity participants to be materially misstated, the DOE should plan and perform\n        verifications with an attitude of professional scepticism and rely on its professional\n        judgment when applying the concept of materiality.\n253.    The application of the concept of materiality and reasonable level of assurance implies\n        that some data or information may not be checked. However, the DOE should design its\n        verification and sampling plans to detect all material errors, omissions or misstatements,\n        and any unchecked data or information should not contain any material errors, omissions\n        or misstatements. A DOE’s verification opinion applies to 100 per cent of the data and\n        information, even if the DOE may not have checked the entire data set and information.\n254.    Applying the concept of materiality does not mean that identified errors are not to be\n        corrected; if an error, omission or misstatement is identified by the DOE, regardless of\n        whether it is material or not, the DOE shall request the activity participants to address it.\n\n9.1.4.2.        Consideration of materiality in planning verification\n255.    The DOE should:\n        (a)     Identify the materiality threshold referred to in paragraph 251 above that\n                corresponds to the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that\n                the specific registered A6.4 PoA will achieve;\n        (b)     Understand the environment in which the registered A6.4 PoA operates, the\n                sources of project emissions within the project boundary and the leakage, the\n                monitoring activities, the equipment used to monitor or measure project data, the\n                origin and application of data used to calculate or measure the emissions, the data\n                flow, the internal quality control system, and the overall organization with respect\n                to monitoring and reporting;19\n        (c)     Conduct a risk assessment to identify and assess the risks of individual or\n                aggregated material errors, omissions or misstatements that may occur within the\n                threshold based on the elements referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above;\n        (d)     Design verification plans, audit procedures20 and sampling plans whose type,\n                timing21 and extent are based on and are responsive to the assessed risks of\n                material errors, omissions or misstatements.\n\n\n19 Adapted from European Union. 2007. Commission Decision of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for\n\n  the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council.\n20 In accordance with section 9.2.5.\n\n21 For example, timing may refer to the specific time intervals for which the DOE may draw its samples.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  52 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n256.    The materiality thresholds apply to the total GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals actually achieved. When planning verification, the DOE should apply the\n        applicable materiality threshold to the reported total emission reductions or removals. If,\n        as a result of the verification, the initially reported total emission reductions or removals is\n        revised, the DOE should reapply the materiality threshold to the revised total emission\n        reductions or removals and, if needed, make adjustments to its verification plans and\n        sampling plans.\n\n9.1.4.3.        Consideration of materiality in conducting verification\n257.    The DOE should:\n        (a)     Apply verification plans, audit procedures and sampling plans;\n        (b)     Assess potential errors, omissions and misstatements against the materiality\n                threshold to determine whether they are material individually or in aggregate and\n                whether further audit procedures are needed.\n258.    If an error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE should be aware that it may\n        not be an isolated occurrence and may be a systemic reoccurring error. For example,\n        other errors may exist if the DOE identifies that the error, omission or misstatement arose\n        from a breakdown in the activity participants’ internal quality control and quality assurance\n        system.\n259.    If an immaterial error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall request the\n        activity participants to address it and should determine whether additional audit\n        procedures should be conducted in order to reach a reasonable level of assurance that\n        the verified GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals are free from material error,\n        omission or misstatement.\n260.    If a material error, omission or misstatement is detected, the DOE shall, depending on the\n        circumstances of the error, immediately request the activity participants to address it, or\n        conduct additional audit procedures to confirm or determine the context and magnitude of\n        the error, omission or misstatement and then request the activity participants to address\n        it.\n261.    If further audit procedures are necessary, the DOE may consider whether the overall\n        verification plans and sampling plans need to be revised.\n\n9.1.5. Standard auditing techniques\n262.    The DOE shall assess the information provided by the activity participants.\n263.    In assessing the information, the DOE shall apply the means of verification specified\n        throughout this standard and, where appropriate, standard auditing techniques, including\n        but not limited to:\n        (a)     Document review, involving:\n                (i)    A review of data and information;\n                (ii)   A review of the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the\n                       applied standardized baselines and the other applied methodological\n                       regulatory documents, paying particular attention to the frequency of\n\n\n\n\n                                                  53 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                        measurements, the quality of metering equipment including calibration\n                        requirements, and the quality assurance and quality control procedures;\n                (iii)   An evaluation of data management and the quality assurance and quality\n                        control system in the context of their influence on the generation and\n                        reporting of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n        (b)     Follow-up actions (e.g. on-site inspection, telephone/e-mail interviews), including:\n                (i)     An assessment of the implementation and operation of the included CPs as\n                        per the included CP-DDs or latest approved revised CP-DDs;\n                (ii)    A review of information flows for generating, aggregating and reporting the\n                        monitoring parameters;\n                (iii)   Interviews with relevant personnel to determine whether the operational and\n                        data collection procedures are implemented in accordance with the\n                        registered monitoring plans;\n                (iv)    Cross-checks between the information provided in the monitoring report and\n                        data from other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase\n                        records or similar data sources to determine whether the information in the\n                        monitoring report is reliable;\n                (v)     A check of the monitoring equipment, including calibration performance, and\n                        observations of monitoring practices against the requirements of the\n                        registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied\n                        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                        documents;\n                (vi)    A review of calculations and assumptions made in determining the GHG data\n                        and GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (vii) An identification of quality control and quality assurance procedures in place\n                      to prevent, or identify and correct, any errors or omissions in the reported\n                      monitoring parameters;\n        (c)     Sampling approach in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for\n                A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body, including:\n                (i)     A random sampling for cases where the activity participants did not apply a\n                        sampling approach to monitoring;\n                (ii)    An acceptance sampling or another sampling approach for cases where the\n                        activity participants applied a sampling approach to monitoring.\n264.    It is mandatory for the DOE to conduct an on-site inspection at verification for an included\n        CP if:\n        (a)     It is the first verification for the DOE with regard to this CP;\n        (b)     More than three years have elapsed since the last on-site inspection conducted for\n                verification for the CP; or\n\n\n\n\n                                                  54 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     The CP has achieved more than 300,000 t CO2 eq of GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals since the last verification when an on-site inspection was\n                conducted.\n265.    For cases that are not referred to in paragraph 264 above, it is optional for the DOE to\n        conduct an on-site inspection at verification. If the DOE does not conduct an on-site\n        inspection as a means of verification, it shall describe the alternative means used and\n        justify that they are sufficient for the purpose of verification. If the DOE conducts a remote\n        inspection as an alternative means to an on-site inspection, the DOE should follow the\n        guidance contained in Appendix 1.\n266.    If any issue related to the project design, including those attributable to the lack of on-site\n        inspection at the previous verification, is identified at the verification, the DOE that\n        detected the issue shall rectify it through the post-registration change process in\n        accordance with the activity cycle procedure.\n267.    Where no specific means of verification are specified, the DOE should apply the standard\n        auditing techniques described in paragraph 263 above.\n\n9.1.6. Corrective action requests, clarification requests and forward action requests\n268.    If the DOE identifies issues that require further elaboration, research or expansion in order\n        to determine whether the implementation or the operation of the registered A6.4 PoA and\n        the included CPs, or the monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals,\n        meets the relevant Article 6.4 mechanism rules and requirements, the DOE shall ensure\n        that these issues are accurately identified, formulated, discussed and concluded in the\n        verification and certification report.\n269.    The DOE shall raise a CAR if one of the following situations occurs:\n        (a)     Non-compliance with the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies,\n                the applied standardized baselines or the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents is found in monitoring and reporting and has not been sufficiently\n                documented by the activity participants, or if the evidence provided to prove\n                conformity is insufficient;\n        (b)     Modifications to the implementation or operation of the registered A6.4 PoA or the\n                included CPs, or the monitoring or GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals,\n                have not been sufficiently documented by the activity participants;\n        (c)     Mistakes have been made by the activity participants in applying assumptions,\n                data or calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that will\n                impact the quantity of emission reductions or removals;\n        (d)     Issues identified in a FAR during the previous validation or verification have not\n                been resolved by the activity participants.\n270.    The DOE shall raise a CL if the information provided by the activity participants is\n        insufficient or not clear enough to determine whether the applicable Article 6.4 mechanism\n        rules and requirements have been met.\n271.    The DOE shall raise a FAR if issues related to monitoring and reporting that require\n        attention and/or adjustment at the next verification are identified.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  55 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n272.     The DOE shall resolve or “close out” CARs and CLs only if the activity participants rectify\n         the monitoring report, or provide additional explanations or evidence that satisfy the DOE’s\n         concerns. If this is not done, the DOE shall not submit a request for issuance of A6.4ERs.\n273.     The DOE shall report on all CARs, CLs and FARs in its verification and certification report.\n         This reporting shall explain the issues raised, the responses provided by the activity\n         participants, the means of verification of such responses, and references to any resulting\n         changes in the monitoring report or its supporting documents.\n\n9.2.     Verification of compliance with specific requirements for issuance\n\n9.2.1. General\n274.     The DOE shall determine, by following the general verification requirements referred to in\n         sections 5 and 9.1 above, whether the monitoring complies with all relevant requirements\n         for monitoring as contained in the activity standard.\n275.     The DOE shall:\n         (a)     Identify the included CPs that it shall consider for verification in accordance with\n                 the methods/procedure to be used and specified in the registered PoA-DD for\n                 verification of the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                 achieved by the CPs. If the registered A6.4 PoA has more than one host Party and\n                 a host Party’s DNA withdraws its approval of the PoA and/or its authorization of\n                 the activity participants, the DOE shall identify only the CPs that are unaffected by\n                 the withdrawal;\n         (b)     Take into account the possible existence of included CPs complying with different\n                 versions of the registered PoA-DD22 and the need to account for this in its sampling\n                 approach to ensure that a statistically sound sample of CPs from each version of\n                 the PoA-DD is being verified;\n         (c)     Systematically verify and certify the correct implementation and operation of the\n                 record-keeping system.\n276.     The DOE shall include in its verification and certification report a description of how it\n         applied the methods/procedures for the purpose of verification. The DOE shall include in\n         its verification and certification report a description of the on-site inspection(s), where\n         conducted in accordance with paragraph 264 or 265 above.\n277.     If the activity participants have prepared a single monitoring report for a monitoring period,\n         the DOE shall confirm that the monitoring report covers all CPs included in the registered\n         A6.4 PoA whose crediting periods overlap with the monitoring period, and contains all\n         monitoring results obtained during the monitoring period.\n278.     If the activity participants have prepared multiple monitoring reports for separate batches\n         of CPs included in the registered A6.4 PoA, the DOE shall confirm that all the monitoring\n         reports contain mutually exclusive batches of CPs, have the same monitoring period, and\n         collectively contain all monitoring results obtained during the period, and that each\n\n\n22   CPs complying with the pre- and post-update of the PoA-DD due to the renewal of the PoA period or\n     post-registration changes during a PoA period have separate monitoring reports in accordance with the\n     activity standard.\n\n\n\n                                                  56 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        monitoring report contains only monitoring results of the CPs that follow the same version\n        of the PoA-DD.\n279.    The DOE shall confirm that monitoring periods have been consecutive. Further, the DOE\n        shall confirm that CPs have been included in requests for issuance of A6.4ERs in a\n        consecutive manner; that is, when a CP has been covered in a request for issuance for a\n        monitoring period, the DOE shall confirm that a request for issuance for the previous\n        monitoring period that covered the particular CP has been published.\n280.    Notwithstanding paragraph 279 above, if the registered A6.4 PoA applies any of the\n        methodologies listed in the activity standard as potentially accruing negative emission\n        reductions in a monitoring period, the DOE shall confirm that A6.4ERs have been issued\n        for all CPs included in the PoA for the previous monitoring period.\n281.    A request for issuance of A6.4ERs shall relate to the A6.4ERs certified.\n282.    The DOE shall confirm the compliance with the requirements on:\n        (a)     General requirements, including on:\n                (i)     The implementation and operation of the A6.4 PoA and the included CPs as\n                        per the description in the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs;\n                (ii)    The continuous monitoring as per the registered monitoring plans;\n                (iii)   The coverage of the monitoring period;\n                (iv)    The presentation of monitoring results by year of occurrence of GHG\n                        emission reductions or net GHG removals;\n                (v)     The preparation of monitoring reports in chronological order and separation\n                        of them by CPs that follow different versions of the PoA-DD;\n                (vi)    The application of appropriate GWPs;\n                (vii) The maintenance of monitoring results;\n                (viii) The maximum annual amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n                       removals to be achieved by the PoA as approved by the host Party;\n        (b)     The avoidance of double issuance;\n        (c)     The description of implemented PoA and included CPs;\n        (d)     The description of monitoring system;\n        (e)     Reversal related actions for component projects involving removals and emission\n                reductions component projects with reversal risks;\n        (f)     The provision of data and parameters used;\n        (g)     The calculation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.;\n        (h)     The continuous engagement of stakeholders.\n283.    When verifying the compliance of the implementation and the operation of the registered\n        A6.4 PoA and included CPs and monitoring of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n\n\n\n                                                  57 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        removals with the requirements for implementation, operation and monitoring referred to\n        in paragraph 282 above, the DOE shall additionally follow the specific guidance on\n        verification regarding some of these requirements provided in sections 9.2.2−9.2.11\n        below.\n284.    The DOE shall ensure before submitting the request for first issuance for the PoA that the\n        host Party statement of authorization of the use of A6.4ERs was provided.\n\n9.2.2. Avoidance of double issuance\n285.    The DOE shall determine whether the registered A6.4 PoA or any of the included CPs are\n        also registered, or covered by a programme, under any other international, regional,\n        national or subnational GHG mitigation crediting scheme prior to the request for issuance\n        based on the confirmation from such other crediting scheme, if applicable, public\n        information and any other information obtained from the activity participants.\n286.    If the DOE determines that the registered A6.4 PoA or any of the included CPs are\n        registered, or covered by a programme, under another crediting scheme, the DOE shall\n        additionally determine whether the activity participants have obtained a confirmation from\n        the other crediting scheme that the same GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n        being requested for issuance of A6.4ERs have not been or will not be credited under the\n        other crediting scheme.\n\n9.2.3. Compliance of the monitoring report with the monitoring report form\n287.    The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report was completed using the valid\n        version of the applicable monitoring report form.\n288.    The DOE shall state its opinion on the compliance of the monitoring report with the relevant\n        form and instructions therein.\n\n9.2.4. Compliance of the programme implementation with the registered programme of\n       activity design document\n289.    The DOE shall identify any concerns related to the conformity of the implemented\n        registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs and their operations with the registered PoA-\n        DD and CP-DDs and determine whether:\n        (a)     The PoA and the CPs have been implemented and are operating in accordance\n                with the descriptions contained in the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs; or\n        (b)     Any deviation or the proposed or actual changes in the implementation or operation\n                of the PoA and/or the CPs comply with the relevant requirements in the activity\n                standard, or\n        (c)     The sum of the amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                requested for issuance and the cumulative amount of GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals already issued for the PoA are up to the maximum annual\n                amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals approved by the host\n                Party.\n290.    By means of an on-site inspection or other means of verification in accordance with\n        paragraph 264 or 265 above, the DOE shall assess that all physical features (e.g.\n        technology, project equipment, and monitoring and metering equipment) of the included\n\n\n\n                                                  58 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        CPs specified in the CP-DDs are in place and that the activity participants are operating\n        the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs as per the registered PoA-DD and CP-DDs.\n        If an on-site inspection is not conducted, the DOE shall justify the rationale for the decision.\n291.    For each monitoring period, the DOE shall report:\n        (a)     The implementation status of the registered A6.4 PoA and the included CPs. For\n                an included CP that consists of more than one site, the DOE shall describe the\n                status of implementation and the starting date of operation for each site. For an\n                included CP with phased implementation, the DOE shall state the progress of the\n                project achieved in each phase under verification. If the phased implementation is\n                delayed, the DOE shall describe the reasons and present the expected\n                implementation dates;\n        (b)     The actual operation of the included CPs;\n        (c)     The information (data and variables) provided in the monitoring report that is\n                different from that stated in the registered PoA-DD or CP-DDs and has caused an\n                increase in the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the\n                included CPs in the current monitoring period or is highly likely to increase the\n                estimates in the future monitoring periods;23\n        (d)     An opinion on the cause of any increase in the actual GHG emission reductions or\n                net GHG removals achieved by the included CPs in the current monitoring period\n                that was reported in monitoring report.\n\n9.2.5. Compliance of the registered monitoring plan with applied methodologies and\n       standardized baselines\n292.    The DOE shall determine whether the registered monitoring plans are in accordance with\n        the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the other applied\n        methodological regulatory documents based on the actual implementation of the CPs.\n293.    For monitoring aspects that are not specified in the applied methodologies, the applied\n        standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory documents, the\n        DOE should highlight issues which may enhance the level of accuracy and completeness\n        of the registered monitoring plans.\n294.    The DOE shall state its opinion on whether the registered monitoring plans are in\n        accordance with the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines and the\n        other applied methodological regulatory documents.\n\n9.2.6. Monitoring activities\n295.    The DOE shall determine whether the monitoring of parameters related to GHG emission\n        reductions or net GHG removals specified in the CP-DDs have been implemented in\n        accordance with the registered monitoring plans.\n296.    The DOE shall determine whether:\n\n\n23 Discrepancies may include higher water availability than expected in the CP-DD, which may increase\n\n  the electricity output from a hydropower plant, or a higher plant load factor owing to higher bagasse\n  availability during the crushing season, which increases the production of steam and electricity.\n\n\n\n                                                  59 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (a)     The registered monitoring plans have been properly implemented and followed by\n                the activity participants;\n        (b)     All parameters stated in the registered monitoring plans have been monitored and\n                updated as applicable;\n        (c)     The equipment used for monitoring is controlled and calibrated in accordance with\n                the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents,\n                local/national standards, or as per the manufacturer’s specification;\n        (d)     Monitoring results are consistently recorded as per the approved frequency;\n        (e)     Quality assurance and quality control procedures have been applied in accordance\n                with the registered monitoring plans.\n297.    If the activity participants applied a sampling approach to determine data and parameters\n        monitored, the DOE shall assess the compliance of the sampling efforts and surveys with\n        the validated sampling plan in accordance with the standard for sampling and surveys for\n        A6.4 activities to be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n298.    The DOE shall list each parameter required by the registered monitoring plans and state\n        how it verified the information flow (from data generation and aggregation, to recording,\n        calculation and reporting) for these parameters, including the values in the monitoring\n        report.\n299.    For CPs involving removals and emission reduction CPs with reversal risks, the DOE shall\n        determine whether the monitoring report includes the following specific elements as per\n        the activity standard and the respective provisions of the removals standard and any\n        applied methodological regulatory documents:\n        (a)     A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;\n        (b)     The estimated GHG emission reductions and/or net removals occurring during the\n                monitoring period, together with the associated uncertainty;\n        (c)     Data collected, including the remote-sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a\n                summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;\n        (d)     Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could\n                have led to the reversal of removals and/or emission reductions along with a\n                summary of the GHG release notifications that were submitted during the period\n                covered by the monitoring report;\n        (e)     Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent\n                with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered CP-DD;\n        (f)     Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been\n                assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the\n                registered CP-DD.\n\n9.2.7. Calibration frequency for measuring instruments\n300.    The DOE shall determine whether the calibration of the measuring equipment that has an\n        impact on the GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals achieved by the included\n\n\n\n                                                  60 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n         CPs is conducted by the activity participants at the frequency specified in the applied\n         methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied methodological\n         regulatory documents or the registered monitoring plans.\n301.     If, during the verification for a certain monitoring period, the DOE identifies that the\n         calibration has been delayed and the calibration has been implemented after the\n         monitoring period in consideration (i.e. the results of delayed calibration are available),\n         referring to the illustrative examples in Appendix 2, the DOE may conclude its verification,\n         provided the following conservative approach is adopted in the calculation of GHG\n         emission reductions or net GHG removals:\n         (a)    Applying the maximum permissible error24 of the instrument to the measured\n                values taken during the period between the scheduled date of calibration and the\n                actual date of calibration, if the results of the delayed calibration do not show any\n                errors in the measuring equipment, or if the error is smaller than the maximum\n                permissible error; or\n         (b)    Applying the error identified in the delayed calibration test, if the error is beyond\n                the maximum permissible error of the measuring equipment.\n302.     The DOE shall confirm that the error has been applied:\n         (a)    In a conservative manner, such that the adjusted measured values of the delayed\n                calibration shall result in fewer GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals that\n                are deemed achieved by the included CPs;\n         (b)    For all measured values taken during the period between the scheduled date of\n                calibration and the actual date of calibration.\n303.     If the results of the delayed calibration are not available, or the calibration has not been\n         conducted at the time of the verification, the DOE, prior to finalizing the verification, shall\n         request the activity participants to conduct the required calibration and shall determine\n         whether the activity participants have calculated GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n         removals conservatively using the approach mentioned in paragraph 301 above.\n304.     If the DOE determines that it is not possible for the activity participants to conduct the\n         calibration at the frequency specified in the applied methodologies, the applied\n         standardized baselines, the other applied methodological regulatory documents or the\n         registered monitoring plans due to reasons beyond the control of the activity participants,25\n         the DOE shall follow the applicable requirements related to post-registration changes in\n         section 8 above.\n305.     If neither the applied methodologies, the applied standardized baselines, the other applied\n         methodological regulatory documents nor the registered monitoring plans specify any\n         requirements for calibration frequency for the measuring equipment, the DOE shall\n         determine whether the equipment is calibrated either in accordance with the specifications\n         of the local/national standards or as per the manufacturer’s specification. If neither\n         local/national standards nor the manufacturer’s specification are available, the DOE shall\n\n\n\n24 The\n     maximum permissible errors of all the measuring instruments are specified by the respective\n  manufacturers as part of their technical specifications.\n25 For example, due to the contractual terms between the activity participant and purchasing/selling entities.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  61 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        determine whether the equipment is calibrated in accordance with the specifications of the\n        international standards.\n\n9.2.8. Reversal related actions for component projects involving removals and emission\n       reductions component projects with reversal risks\n306.    In cases of any observed event involving the release of stored GHGs that could potentially\n        lead to reversal, the DOE shall determine on the basis of transparent and verifiable\n        evidence whether the event as per the preliminary assessment report, prepared in\n        accordance with the requirements of the activity standard, respective provisions of the\n        removals standard on reversal-related actions and any other relevant applied\n        methodological regulatory documents, results in an actual reversal or not.\n307.    If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the\n        preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual\n        reversal and a monitoring report is prepared, the DOE shall determine whether the\n        monitoring report is in compliance with the requirements of the activity standard,\n        respective provisions of the removals standard and any other relevant applied\n        methodological regulatory documents.\n308.    The DOE shall also assess whether the monitoring report accurately estimates the\n        magnitude of reversals and correctly characterizes them as avoidable or unavoidable.\n309.    The DOE shall also assess whether following the submission of the monitoring report:\n        (a)     The risk assessment of the affected CPs has been updated and the risk rating of\n                the affected CPs has been revised;\n        (b)     The compliance with requirements and safeguards contained in the A6.4 SD Tool,\n                taking into account any negative environmental and social impacts caused by the\n                reversal and plans developed to prevent the recurrence of such negative\n                environmental and social impacts, has been reviewed.\n\n9.2.9. Data and calculations of emission reductions or net removals\n310.    The DOE shall assess the data and calculations of GHG emission reductions or net GHG\n        removals achieved by the included CPs and determine whether:\n        (a)     A complete set of data for the specified monitoring period is available. If only partial\n                data are available because activity levels or non-activity parameters have not been\n                monitored in accordance with the registered monitoring plans, the DOE shall\n                assess whether:\n                (i)    The most conservative values approach is applied to the parameters for the\n                       entire non-monitoring period in accordance with the provisions relating to\n                       temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied\n                       methodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard;\n                       or\n                (ii)   Alternative monitoring arrangements for the non-monitoring period are\n                       described, whether they apply conservative assumptions or discount factors\n                       to the calculations, and whether the alternative monitoring arrangements\n                       have been approved by the Supervisory Body under the prior-approval track\n                       or under the issuance track in accordance with the provisions relating to\n\n\n\n                                                  62 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                       temporary deviation from the registered monitoring plan, the applied\n                       methodologies or the applied standardized baselines in the activity standard\n                       and the activity cycle procedure;\n        (b)     The information provided in the monitoring report has been cross-checked with\n                other sources such as plant logbooks, inventories, purchase records and\n                laboratory analysis;\n        (c)     The calculations of baseline GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals,\n                project GHG emissions or actual net GHG removals, and leakage GHG emissions\n                have been carried out in accordance with the formulae and methods described in\n                the registered monitoring plans, the applied methodologies, the applied\n                standardized baselines and the other applied methodological regulatory\n                documents;\n        (d)     Where CPs involving removals also result in emission reductions, the accounting\n                of removals and emission reductions has been separated in the monitoring report\n                in accordance with the methodologies applicable to the activity.\n        (e)     Any assumptions used in emission or removal calculations have been justified;\n        (f)     Appropriate emission factors, IPCC default values, GWPs and other reference\n                values have been correctly applied;\n        (g)     If the included CPs apply an approved standardized baseline that standardizes\n                baseline emissions, the standardized values of the parameters have been applied\n                using the correct version of the applied standardized baseline in accordance with\n                the activity standard.\n311.    The DOE shall provide:\n        (a)     An indication of whether a complete set of data for the monitoring period was not\n                available because activity levels or non-activity parameters were not monitored in\n                accordance with the registered monitoring plans, and if so, whether the most\n                conservative values approach was applied or alternative monitoring arrangements\n                were proposed or have been approved by the Supervisory Body;\n        (b)     A description of how the DOE cross-checked reported data;\n        (c)     A confirmation that appropriate methods and formulae for calculating baseline\n                GHG emissions or baseline net GHG removals, project GHG emissions or actual\n                net GHG removals and leakage GHG emissions, have been followed;\n        (d)     An opinion on whether the assumptions, emission factors and default values that\n                were applied in the calculations have been justified.\n\n9.2.10. Environmental impacts, social impacts and sustainable development impacts\n312.    The DOE shall verify the appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of information\n        provided in the monitoring of the environmental and social indicators in the A6.4\n        Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators\n        in the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form, as reported in a monitoring report.\n313.    If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in the A6.4 Environmental and\n        social management plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form that were\n\n\n\n                                                  63 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        validated at the registration, it shall provide its opinion to the activity participants on the\n        observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and\n        environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in the A6.4 Environmental and social\n        safeguards risk assessment form, A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form\n        and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form.\n314.    The DOE shall review any input and comments received via continuous engagement of\n        local stakeholders in accordance with the activity standard, conduct interviews with local\n        stakeholders, and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post\n        fulfilment of risk assessments and SD impacts due to the CP.\n315.    The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and\n        reported the parameters established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management\n        plan form and A6.4 Sustainable development impact form submitted at the registration\n        stage.\n316.    For projects that successfully transitioned from the clean development mechanism (CDM)\n        and that prepared a “Sustainable development co-benefits description report” in\n        accordance with the “Sustainable development co-benefits tool” at the time of transition,\n        the DOE shall determine whether the monitoring report includes the outcome of monitoring\n        of the sustainable development co-benefits of the project based on the document\n        describing how the activity participant monitors sustainable development co-benefits of\n        the activity, including the frequency of reporting of monitoring results in accordance with\n        relevant provisions of the “Standard: Transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4\n        mechanism”.\n\n9.2.11.

The DOE shall describe all documentation supporting the verification and make it available\n        on request.\n322.    The DOE shall, based on its verification, certify in writing that some or all of the included\n        CPs in the registered A6.4 PoA achieved the verified amount of GHG emission reductions\n\n\n                                                  65 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        or net GHG removals during the specified monitoring period that would not have occurred\n        in the absence of the CPs.26\n323.    If the DOE identifies unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the parameters\n        established in the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan form and the A6.4\n        Sustainable development impact form and cannot be remediated by consultation or\n        mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion or submit a deviation request\n        to the Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance.\n324.    The DOE shall notify the activity participants of the verification outcome, containing:\n        (a)     A positive verification opinion with a verified amount of GHG emission reductions\n                or net GHG removals, and the date of submission of the verification and\n                certification report as part of the request for issuance of A6.4ERs to the secretariat;\n                or\n        (b)     A negative verification opinion, including the reasons for the monitoring results, as\n                documented, having been determined as not complying with the relevant\n                requirements for issuance.\n\n10. Validation for renewal of programme of activities period\n    and renewal of crediting period of component projects\n10.1. Renewal of programme of activities period\n325.    The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have updated sections of the\n        PoA-DD relating to the eligibility criteria for inclusion of CPs in the A6.4 PoA, the baseline,\n        estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the monitoring plan and the\n        PoA period using the valid version of the approved methodologies and, where applicable,\n        the approved standardized baselines and the other methodological regulatory documents\n        that are applicable to the PoA.\n326.    The DOE shall apply the objectives, approach and means of validation in section 6.1\n        above, mutatis mutandis, when validating for renewal of the PoA period.\n327.    If the activity participants used a later valid version of the PoA-DD form for the updated\n        PoA-DD than the version of the form of the registered PoA-DD, the DOE shall determine\n        whether the information transferred to the later valid version of the form is materially the\n        same as that in the registered PoA-DD.\n328.    The DOE shall assess the modalities for setting the baseline for new CPs that may be\n        included in the A6.4 PoA or for updating the baseline for the existing CPs at the renewal\n        of the crediting periods in the new PoA period through an assessment of the correctness\n        of the application of the latest version of the approved methodologies and, where\n        applicable, the approved standardized baselines and the other methodological regulatory\n        documents for the determination of the modalities for setting the baseline or updating it,\n        and estimating GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals for the applicable PoA\n        period.\n\n\n\n26 The certification report constitutes a request to the Supervisory Body for issuance of A6.4ERs equal to\n\n  the verified amount of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals.\n\n\n\n                                                  66 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n329.    The DOE shall check that the names of the activity participants included in the updated\n        PoA-DD are consistent with the names of the activity participants in the latest version of\n        the MoC statement.\n330.    If the activity participants selected another methodology, methodological tool and/or\n        standardized baseline for the purpose of renewal of the PoA period due to the\n        inapplicability of the valid version of the methodology (including a consolidated\n        methodology thereof), methodological tool and/or standardized baseline applied to the\n        registered PoA-DD, the DOE shall assess whether the updated PoA-DD complies with all\n        the requirements of the selected methodology, methodological tool and/or standardized\n        baseline except for additionality demonstration.\n331.    If the activity participants requested a deviation from the valid version of the methodology\n        (including a consolidated methodology thereof) and/or methodological tool applied in the\n        registered PoA-DD, or from any other selected methodology and/or methodological tool\n        for the purpose of renewal of the PoA period, or if the DOE finds at validation that the\n        updated PoA-DD deviated from the valid version of the methodology and/or\n        methodological tool applied in the registered PoA-DD, or from any other selected\n        methodology and/or methodological tool, paragraph 73 above shall apply, mutatis\n        mutandis.\n332.    If the activity participants requested approval of post-registration changes together with\n        the request for renewal of the PoA period, the DOE shall also validate the post-registration\n        changes in accordance with the relevant requirements in section 8 above and the activity\n        cycle procedure, and shall submit a request for approval of post-registration changes\n        together with the request for renewal of the PoA period in accordance with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity cycle procedure.\n333.    The DOE shall request the activity participants to provide an updated PoA-DD (with its\n        revised updated generic CP-DD) prepared in accordance with the relevant requirements\n        in the activity standard.\n334.    The DOE shall prepare a validation report for renewal of the PoA period using the valid\n        version of the applicable validation report form for renewal of the PoA period.\n335.    In its validation report for renewal of the PoA period, the DOE shall:\n        (a)     Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusions on whether:\n                (i)     The updated PoA-DD has been completed using the valid version of the\n                        applicable PoA-DD form, following the instructions therein;\n                (ii)    The information transferred to the later valid version of the PoA-DD form is\n                        materially the same as that in the registered PoA-DD, where applicable;\n                (iii)   The methodologies and, where applicable, the standardized baselines and\n                        the other methodological regulatory documents were applied in accordance\n                        with the applicable requirements in the activity standard;\n                (iv)    The modalities for estimating the baseline, estimating GHG emission\n                        reductions or net GHG removals, and developing the monitoring plan in the\n                        updated PoA-DD comply with the applicable requirements in the activity\n                        project standard, and the valid version of the methodologies and, where\n\n\n\n\n                                                  67 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                       applicable, the standardized baselines and the other methodological\n                       regulatory documents that are applied in the updated PoA-DD;\n                (v)    The next PoA period commences on the day immediately after the expiration\n                       of the current PoA period;\n                (vi)   The names of the activity participants in the updated PoA-DD are consistent\n                       with the names of the activity participants in the latest version of the MoC\n                       statement;\n        (b)     Report on all items listed in paragraph 120 above except for its subparagraph\n                120(g) above;\n        (c)     Follow paragraphs 115−117 above, mutatis mutandis, on its validation opinion;\n        (d)     Provide a statement on whether any proposed post-registration changes for the\n                next PoA period will be submitted together with the request for renewal of the PoA\n                period.\n\n10.2. Renewal of crediting period of component project activities\n\n10.2.1. General requirements\n\n10.2.1.1.       Overarching requirement\n336.    The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have updated the CP-DD in\n        accordance with the relevant requirements for renewal of the crediting period in the activity\n        standard.\n\n10.2.1.2.       Other requirement\n337.    If the activity participants used a later valid version of the CP-DD form for the updated CP-\n        DD than the version of the form of the registered CP-DD, the DOE shall determine whether\n        the information transferred to the later valid version of the form is materially the same as\n        that in the registered CP-DD.\n\n10.3. Validation of compliance with specific requirements for renewal\n\n10.3.1. General\n338.    The DOE shall determine whether the activity participants have updated sections of the\n        CP-DD relating to the demonstration of eligibility for being included in the A6.4 PoA, the\n        baseline, estimated GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals, the monitoring plan\n        and the crediting period in accordance with the generic CP in the latest version of the PoA-\n        DD.\n339.    The DOE shall determine, by following the general validation requirements referred to in\n        section 7.1 above, mutatis mutandis, whether the proposed renewal of the crediting period\n        of an included CP complies with all relevant requirements for renewal contained in the\n        activity standard, including the requirements on:\n        (a)     Application of valid version of the methodologies and methodological tools;\n        (b)     Application of an approved standardized baseline;\n\n\n\n\n                                                  68 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n        (c)     Validity of the original baseline or its update;\n        (d)     Update of the BAU scenario and emissions, the baseline scenario and emissions,\n                and the difference between the baseline and BAU emissions;\n        (e)     Update of the downwards adjustment;\n        (f)     Update of the regulatory analysis for the additionality;\n        (g)     Update of the estimated GHG emissions and net GHG removals (if applicable);\n        (h)     Update of the monitoring plan (if applicable);\n        (i)     Update of the A6.4 SD Tool forms;\n        (j)     Updated risk assessment and monitoring plan for component projects involving\n                removals and emission reduction component projects with reversal risks;\n        (k)     Update of the crediting period;\n        (l)     Update of MoC statement;\n        (m)     Combination of post-registration changes at renewal, if applicable.\n\n10.3.2. Application of valid version of the methodologies and methodological tools\n340.    If the activity participants selected another methodology, methodological tool and/or\n        standardized baseline for the purpose of renewal of the crediting period of the included\n        CP due to the inapplicability of the valid version of the methodology (including a\n        consolidated methodology thereof), methodological tool and/or standardized baseline\n        applied to the registered CP-DD, the DOE shall assess whether the updated CP-DD\n        complies with all the requirements of the selected methodology, methodological tool\n        and/or standardized baseline.\n341.    If the activity participants deviated from the valid version of the methodology (including a\n        consolidated methodology thereof) and/or methodological tool applied to the registered\n        CP-DD, or from any other selected methodology and/or methodological tool for the\n        purpose of renewal of the crediting period of the included CP, section 7.6.1 above shall\n        apply, mutatis mutandis.\n\n10.3.3. Validity of original baseline or its update\n342.    The DOE shall assess the validity of the original baseline or its update through an\n        assessment of the following issues:\n        (a)     The modalities for setting the baseline described in the generic CP-DD in the latest\n                version of the PoA-DD applicable for the valid PoA period for the purpose of\n                inclusion of new corresponding CPs and renewal of the crediting period of existing\n                corresponding CPs;\n        (b)     The correctness of the application of the approved methodologies and, where\n                applicable, the approved standardized baselines and the other methodological\n                regulatory documents for the determination of the continued validity of the baseline\n                or its update, and the estimation of GHG emission reductions or net GHG removals\n                for the applicable crediting period of the included CP.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  69 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n343.    The requirement contained in paragraph 342 above shall not apply to an included CP\n        applying the valid version of an applicable approved standardized baseline that\n        standardizes the baseline scenario.\n\n10.3.4. Combination of post-registration changes at renewal\n344.    If the activity participants wish to combine post-registration changes with the renewal of\n        the crediting period of the included CP, the DOE shall also validate the post-registration\n        changes in accordance with the relevant requirements in section 8 above and the activity\n        cycle procedure, and shall notify the secretariat of the post-registration changes together\n        with the renewal of the crediting period of the CP in accordance with the relevant\n        requirements in the activity cycle procedure.\n\n10.4. Validation report\n345.    In its validation report for renewal of the crediting period, the DOE shall:\n        (a)     Report on all items listed in paragraph 120 above except for its subparagraph\n                120(e) above;\n        (b)     Provide all its applied approaches, findings and conclusions on the assessment of:\n                (i)    Whether the revised CP-DD is prepared using the valid version of the\n                       applicable form and following the instructions therein, as applicable;\n                (ii)   The compliance of the updated project design with the requirements for\n                       renewal of the crediting period conducted in accordance with sections 10.1‒\n                       10.3 above, including the CARs, CLs or FARs issued to the activity\n                       participants and how they have been addressed by them;\n        (c)     State whether there are any proposed post-registration changes effective from the\n                start date of the next crediting period in the notification of renewal of the crediting\n                period of the included CP, and if the validation is primarily for the latter.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  70 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. Guidance on remote inspection as                                                      an\n            alternative means to an on-site inspection\n\n1.      In this document, a remote inspection for the purpose of validation or verification refers to\n        the component projects (CPs) for which the validation or verification team of the\n        designated operational entity (DOE) carries out the same activities as in a physical on-site\n        inspection through information and communication technology (ICT) tools.\n2.      There are risks posed by remote inspections, including in the use of ICT tools. In order to\n        ensure a level of assurance of the validation or verification that is comparable to the level\n        of an on-site inspection, there needs to be measures in place to reduce these risks.\n3.      The DOE should identify risks pertaining to the remote inspection for each validation or\n        verification activity and establish and implement measures to eliminate or reduce those\n        risks. A DOE should also integrate this risk assessment process into its quality\n        management systems.\n4.      The DOE should implement the following actions at different stages of a validation or\n        verification activity:\n        (a)     Risk assessment stage: The feasibility of conducting a remote inspection depends\n                on the risk level and whether measures to eliminate or reduce the risks are\n                adequate for the validation or verification. Therefore, a risk assessment to be\n                conducted by the DOE should cover the following aspects:\n                (i)    Identifying and assessing the risks inherent in a remote inspection. The risks\n                       may be at different levels and could cover different aspects; hence the risk\n                       identification and assessment should cover:\n                        a.     Risks related to organizational and procedural aspects, which include\n                               generic risks. These risks could relate to the following: the quality of\n                               the Internet connection; the quality of ICT tools such as good\n                               camerawork to ensure a reasonably good view for the validation or\n                               verification team; the amount of documentation to be reviewed\n                               remotely; whether relevant data flows can be accessed remotely; the\n                               record-keeping system established; the maintaining of confidentiality\n                               and personnel data protection; and the required competence and\n                               resources of the validation or verification team;\n                        b.     Risks related to the project and its configuration, which present\n                               project-specific risks. The risks could relate to the following: whether\n                               the boundary and features of the project can be evaluated remotely;\n                               whether the remote inspection would enable the DOE to observe any\n                               sources of emissions that are not included in the project; how control\n                               activities are carried out; and how calculations are tracked and cross-\n                               checked;\n                        c.     Risks related to monitoring aspects. The risks could relate to the\n                               following: the complexity of the monitoring parameters and the\n                               monitoring plan; data processing and reporting; whether a fiscal\n                               metering method is applied; the sampling or surveys conducted at\n                               household level; the status of the monitoring period being verified;\n\n                                                  71 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\n                                and whether data and information have been thoroughly checked\n                                during previous verifications or whether such data and information\n                                can be checked subsequently without an on-site inspection;\n                (ii)    Establishing measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. The DOE\n                        should establish measures to eliminate or reduce each identified risk at the\n                        different levels described in subparagraph (i) above;\n                (iii)   The risk assessment pertaining to the remote inspection may be undertaken\n                        in the context of the application of materiality following the relevant provisions\n                        in this standard;\n        (b)     Planning stage: Based on risk assessment outcomes, the DOE should plan the\n                validation or verification activity as follows:\n                (i)     Composing a validation or verification team with sufficient members that\n                        have the knowledge, skill and solid professional judgment required in an on-\n                        site inspection in conjunction with additional competence in applying ICT\n                        tools;\n                (ii)    Conducting a desk review to gain a prior understanding of records and\n                        documentation control processes of the activity participants;\n                (iii)   Establishing a validation or verification plan to clearly define the tasks to be\n                        performed during the remote inspection, taking into account the established\n                        measures to eliminate or reduce the identified risks. This includes a detailed\n                        allocation of responsibilities by different validation or verification team\n                        members with the required knowledge and specific time zones to ensure the\n                        team members audit separately and make the best use of time;\n                (iv)    Determining ICT tools to be used with the activity participants and conducting\n                        a test on the agreed ICT tools before the remote inspection to ensure that\n                        there is a stable connection and understanding of how to use such ICT tools.\n                        The DOE should also ensure that there is a backup plan in case there is a\n                        connection issue;\n        (c)     Implementation stage: During the remote inspection, the DOE should implement\n                measures it has established to mitigate the identified risks, while conducting the\n                validation or verification following the relevant requirements of this standard. At this\n                stage, the DOE may decide to extend or terminate the remote inspection if it finds\n                during the remote inspection that the actual risks are higher than initially assessed.\n        (d)     Post-remote inspection stage: The DOE should:\n                (i)     Assess whether another round of remote inspection is needed while\n                        reviewing the activity participants’ response to clarification requests,\n                        corrective action requests and/or forward action requests;\n                (ii)    Ensure that its technical review process is able to identify any risks that were\n                        not identified during the risk assessment stage.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  72 of 74\nA6.4-STAN-AC-005\nStandard: Article 6.4 validation and verification standard for programmes of activities\nVersion 02.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 2. Calibration\n\n1.      This Appendix provides an illustrative example for applying the provisions in paragraph\n        301(a) and (b) of this standard.\n2.      An electricity energy meter with a maximum permissible error (±5 per cent), which may be\n        used for measuring the electricity export for baseline emissions and electricity import for\n        project emission calculations, is required to be calibrated every year. If the calibration is\n        delayed and instead of after one year it is conducted after one and a half years, and the\n        result of the delayed calibration is available at the time of verification, to account for the\n        delayed calibration the measured values shall be corrected as demonstrated in Table 1\n        and Table 2 below for situations stipulated in paragraph 301(a) and (b) of this standard.\n\n        Table 1.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted rules, modalities and procedures (RMPs)\n          for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (the\n          Article 6.4). 1 In accordance with the RMPs, a proposed or registered Article 6.4\n          mechanism activity (A6.4 activity) as well as monitored greenhouse gas (GHG) emission\n          reductions or net GHG removals achieved by an A6.4 activity shall be independently\n          assessed by a designated operational entity (DOE) against the requirements set out in the\n          RMPs in order for the activity to be registered or renewed under the Article 6.4, or Article\n          6, paragraph 4 emission reductions (A6.4ERs) to be issued. 2\n\n2.        Pursuant to the RMPs, the Supervisory Body is responsible for the accreditation of\n          operational entities as DOEs and the establishment of the requirements and process\n          necessary to operate the accreditation. 3 The CMA, at its third session, requested the\n          Supervisory Body to review the accreditation standards and procedures of the clean\n          development mechanism (CDM) with a view to applying them with revisions, as\n          appropriate, for the Article 6.4 mechanism by the end of 2023, and expeditiously accredit\n          operational entities as DOEs.4\n\n1.2.      Objective\n3.        The objective of the “Standard: Article 6.4 accreditation” (hereinafter referred to as this\n          standard) is to set forth concise and uniform requirements for the accreditation and the\n          maintaining of accreditation status of competent and impartial operational entities5 under\n          the Article 6.4.\n\n2.

Risks may include, but are not limited to, those associated with:7\n\n         (a)     The objectives of the validation/verification and the VVS-P and VVS-PoA\n                 requirements;\n\n         (b)     Competence, consistency and real as well as perceived impartiality;\n\n         (c)     Legal, regulatory and liability issues;\n\n         (d)     The client organization for which validation and/or verification/certification service\n                 is being provided and its management system, operating environment, geographic\n                 location, among other factors;\n\n         (e)     The susceptibility of any parameter included in the information to be validated and\n                 verified to generate a material misstatement, even if there is a control system\n                 implemented;\n\n         (f)     The level of assurance to be achieved in the verification/certification process and\n                 the corresponding evidence-gathering used in the validation and/or\n                 verification/certification process;\n\n         (g)     Risk control and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\n7    ISO/IEC 17029:2019.\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\n5.       Sectoral scopes of accreditation\n10.      To conduct the validation and/or verification/certification of an Article 6.4 project activity\n         (A6.4 project) or programme of activity (A6.4 PoA) and issue a validation and/or\n         verification/certification opinion and report, a DOE shall be accredited in the sectoral\n         scope(s) of the methodology(ies) applied by the A6.4 project or PoA. The sectoral scopes\n         as contained in appendix 2 to this standard are to be further revised at either of the\n         following: (a) upon approval of Article 6.4 methodological requirements, including\n         removals and related methodologies by the CMA and the Supervisory Body; and (b) upon\n         such approval of any new additional sectoral scopes as well as based upon the operational\n         efficiency of those proposed sectoral scopes gained from the experiences of actual\n         implementations.8\n\n6.       Legal status and matters\n11.      A DOE shall be an entity registered or incorporated under applicable national laws so that\n         it can function legally, enter into contracts, make decisions independently and may be\n         sued in its own name.\n\n12.      A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for handling of\n         judicial processes and maintain a record of all the judicial processes pending against it as\n         well as information of any judicial cases held in the past. “Judicial process” herein shall\n         mean any type of legal proceeding of any nature, including but not limited to administrative,\n         civil or criminal proceedings, before a national or international court or tribunal, or\n         administrative body, whether such proceeding is related to the DOE’s capacity under\n         Article 6.4 or otherwise.\n\n13.      The procedure referred to in paragraph 12 above shall include the following:\n\n         (a)     The designation of personnel responsible for handling of judicial processes;\n         (b)     The process for handling of the judicial case, including gathering and verifying all\n                 necessary information for deciding what actions are to be taken in response to it;\n         (c)     Ensuring that appropriate corrections and corrective actions are taken, if needed;\n\n         (d)     Prompt reporting of the subject matter of a judicial process pending or instituted\n                 against the AE/DOE to the UNFCCC secretariat, if the matter is such that it is\n                 incompatible with its function as a DOE.\n\n14.      If the subject matter of a judicial process pending or instituted against the AE/DOE is such\n         that it is incompatible with its functions as a DOE as paragraph 13(d) above, the AE/DOE\n         shall promptly report the matter to the UNFCCC secretariat within 14 days.\n\n15.      Upon receipt of such report, the secretariat shall report the same to the Supervisory Body\n         within seven days for its consideration. Based on severity of the judicial case, the\n         Supervisory      Body     will  decide    whether      to    place    the   DOE     under-\n         observation/suspension/withdrawal of accreditation as per the provisions defined under\n         Article 6.4 accreditation procedure.\n\n\n\n8   The operational efficiency gained from the actual implementation experiences may result in the need to\n    reclassification of those proposed sectoral scopes.\n\n\n\n                                                  9 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\n7.        Finance and liability\n7.1.      Financial stability\n16.       A DOE shall demonstrate to the Supervisory Body throughout the accreditation term that\n          it has the financial resources and stability required for its validation and/or\n          verification/certification functions through:\n\n          (a)      Evidence of financial resources including the previous three years’ financial\n                   statements for companies existing for more than three years (e.g. balance sheets,\n                   profit and loss accounts); 9 or any other relevant evidence such as shareholder\n                   commitment for newly established companies; and\n\n          (b)      Business plan or workplan or equivalent financial plan for the next three years.\n\n17.       A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for regularly\n          monitoring, at least annually, its income and expenditure to determine the financial stability\n          and resources required for its validation and/or verification/certification functions.\n\n7.2.      Liability\n18.       A DOE shall demonstrate to the Supervisory Body throughout the accreditation term that\n          it has analysed, identified and evaluated the nature, scale and impact of all potential risks\n          arising from its validation and/or verification/certification functions, at least annually, and\n          has arrangements as referred to in the paragraph 19 below to cover the identified risks\n          arising from its activities in validation and/or verification/certification in the geographic\n          areas it operates.10\n\n19.       The arrangements to cover potential risks shall be:11\n\n          (a)      Liability insurance; and/or\n          (b)      Financial resource reserves, such as bank savings and/or short/long-term\n                   liquidities.12\n\n\n\n\n9    In this context, financial statements audited by a related body are not considered “externally audited\n     financial statements”.\n10   ISO/IEC 17029:2019.\n11 The liabilities arising from the potential risks may include a range of issues under the DOE’s responsibility\n\n     that might adversely impact the clients, such as the following: (a) mistakes in the validation and/ or\n     verification/certification which result in incorrect validation opinion and/or verified amount of Article 6.4\n     emission reductions; (b) delay of the validation and/or verification/certification timeline required in the\n     contract signed; (c) rejection of the request for registration and/or request for issuance made by the\n     Supervisory Body; and (d) suspension or withdrawal of accreditation status of the DOE resulting in\n     prohibition on the part of the DOE to finalize and issue any on-going validation and/or verification opinions\n     and reports.\n12 Calculation of the level of liability insurance and/or financial resource reserves may include a range of\n\n     risk assessment approaches, such as the following: (a) failure modes and effects analysis approach (i.e.\n     a product of the probability of issue, the ability to detect issue, and the impact of issue); (b) the risk matrix\n     approach (i.e. a product of the impact of issue and its frequency); and (c) the risk factor approach (i.e. a\n     product of the risk factor and the expected turnover of the DOE’s business).\n\n\n\n                                                       10 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\n8.

The DOE shall keep a record\n         of this review.\n\n10. Human resources and competence\n10.1. Sufficiency of human resources\n\n10.1.1. General\n\n49.      A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for determining\n         human resources having the competence prescribed in sections 10.2 and 10.3 below in\n         order to perform its validation and/or verification/certification functions.\n\n50.      A DOE shall have sufficient human resources with the necessary competence relating to\n         the type, range, and volume of estimated/planned workload for each technical area in\n         which the DOE intends to operate or operates, within all sectoral scopes in which the DOE\n         has applied for accreditation or has been accredited.\n51.      The DOE shall ensure that the management personnel are internal resources.18\n\n52.      For functions other than management functions, a DOE may fulfil the requirement for\n         sufficient resources by:\n\n         (a)     Using internal resources; and/or\n\n         (b)     Outsourcing, as defined in paragraphs 57–65 below.\n\n53.      A DOE shall evaluate, at least annually, the sufficiency of human resources required to\n         perform its validation and/or verification/certification functions, taking into account the\n         necessary competence related to the technical area(s), geographical locations of A6.4\n         projects and PoAs, past performance of its validation and/or verification/certification\n         functions, and expected volume of its validation and/or verification/certification activities\n         for the future. The DOE shall document the evaluation conducted and its results.\n\n54.      The DOE shall ensure that the validation and verification/certification personnel,\n         irrespective of whether they are internal or external resources, are under the\n         responsibility19 of a member of the DOE’s management.\n\n\n\n\n18   Internal resources require direct employment by the AE/DOE as an employee. The physical location of\n     such personnel is inconsequential.\n19   Responsibility in this context does not refer to oversight of human resources in terms of employment,\n     but rather to the oversight of validation and verification activities.\n\n\n\n                                                 18 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n55.

Functions that may be outsourced\n\n1.      The table below contains the accreditation requirements contained in this standard and\n        provides the rules for the functions that may be outsourced to an entity as defined in\n        paragraphs 57–62 above.\n\n2.      In the last column of the table, “YES” indicates that the function corresponding to the\n        requirement may be outsourced, and “NO” indicates that the function shall not be\n        outsourced. “N/A” indicates that the outsourcing is not applicable (e.g. the requirement is\n        not a function). In cases where a requirement is for the DOE to have a documented\n        procedure, the corresponding function that can be outsourced (if a “YES” is indicated) is\n        that the outsourced entity shall implement the DOE’s procedure.\n\n3.      In the last column of the table, items marked with “YES” followed by a “*” indicate that the\n        outsourcing can be undertaken exclusively in the context of the other functions that are\n        carried out by the outsourced body.\n\n\n\n\n                                              36 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\nTable.

Risks may include, but are not limited to, those associated with:7\n\n         (a)     The objectives of the validation/verification and the VVS-P and VVS-PoA\n                 requirements;\n\n         (b)     Competence, consistency and real as well as perceived impartiality;\n\n         (c)     Legal, regulatory and liability issues;\n\n         (d)     The client organization for which validation and/or verification/certification service\n                 is being provided and its management system, operating environment, geographic\n                 location, among other factors;\n\n         (e)     The susceptibility of any parameter included in the information to be validated and\n                 verified to generate a material misstatement, even if there is a control system\n                 implemented;\n\n         (f)     The level of assurance to be achieved in the verification/certification process and\n                 the corresponding evidence-gathering used in the validation and/or\n                 verification/certification process;\n\n         (g)     Risk control and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\n7    ISO/IEC 17029:2019.\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\n5.       Sectoral scopes of accreditation\n10.      To conduct the validation and/or verification/certification of an Article 6.4 project activity\n         (A6.4 project) or programme of activity (A6.4 PoA) and issue a validation and/or\n         verification/certification opinion and report, a DOE shall be accredited in the sectoral\n         scope(s) of the methodology(ies) applied by the A6.4 project or PoA. The sectoral scopes\n         as contained in appendix 2 to this standard are to be further revised at either of the\n         following: (a) upon approval of Article 6.4 methodological requirements, including\n         removals and related methodologies by the CMA and the Supervisory Body; and (b) upon\n         such approval of any new additional sectoral scopes as well as based upon the operational\n         efficiency of those proposed sectoral scopes gained from the experiences of actual\n         implementations.8\n\n6.       Legal status and matters\n11.      A DOE shall be an entity registered or incorporated under applicable national laws so that\n         it can function legally, enter into contracts, make decisions independently and may be\n         sued in its own name.\n\n12.      A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for handling of\n         judicial processes and maintain a record of all the judicial processes pending against it as\n         well as information of any judicial cases held in the past. “Judicial process” herein shall\n         mean any type of legal proceeding of any nature, including but not limited to administrative,\n         civil or criminal proceedings, before a national or international court or tribunal, or\n         administrative body, whether such proceeding is related to the DOE’s capacity under\n         Article 6.4 or otherwise.\n\n13.      The procedure referred to in paragraph 12 above shall include the following:\n\n         (a)     The designation of personnel responsible for handling of judicial processes;\n         (b)     The process for handling of the judicial case, including gathering and verifying all\n                 necessary information for deciding what actions are to be taken in response to it;\n         (c)     Ensuring that appropriate corrections and corrective actions are taken, if needed;\n\n         (d)     Prompt reporting of the subject matter of a judicial process pending or instituted\n                 against the AE/DOE to the UNFCCC secretariat, if the matter is such that it is\n                 incompatible with its function as a DOE.\n\n14.      If the subject matter of a judicial process pending or instituted against the AE/DOE is such\n         that it is incompatible with its functions as a DOE as paragraph 13(d) above, the AE/DOE\n         shall promptly report the matter to the UNFCCC secretariat within 14 days.\n\n15.      Upon receipt of such report, the secretariat shall report the same to the Supervisory Body\n         within seven days for its consideration. Based on severity of the judicial case, the\n         Supervisory      Body     will  decide    whether      to    place    the   DOE     under-\n         observation/suspension/withdrawal of accreditation as per the provisions defined under\n         Article 6.4 accreditation procedure.\n\n\n\n8   The operational efficiency gained from the actual implementation experiences may result in the need to\n    reclassification of those proposed sectoral scopes.\n\n\n\n                                                  9 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\n7.        Finance and liability\n7.1.      Financial stability\n16.       A DOE shall demonstrate to the Supervisory Body throughout the accreditation term that\n          it has the financial resources and stability required for its validation and/or\n          verification/certification functions through:\n\n          (a)      Evidence of financial resources including the previous three years’ financial\n                   statements for companies existing for more than three years (e.g. balance sheets,\n                   profit and loss accounts); 9 or any other relevant evidence such as shareholder\n                   commitment for newly established companies; and\n\n          (b)      Business plan or workplan or equivalent financial plan for the next three years.\n\n17.       A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for regularly\n          monitoring, at least annually, its income and expenditure to determine the financial stability\n          and resources required for its validation and/or verification/certification functions.\n\n7.2.      Liability\n18.       A DOE shall demonstrate to the Supervisory Body throughout the accreditation term that\n          it has analysed, identified and evaluated the nature, scale and impact of all potential risks\n          arising from its validation and/or verification/certification functions, at least annually, and\n          has arrangements as referred to in the paragraph 19 below to cover the identified risks\n          arising from its activities in validation and/or verification/certification in the geographic\n          areas it operates.10\n\n19.       The arrangements to cover potential risks shall be:11\n\n          (a)      Liability insurance; and/or\n          (b)      Financial resource reserves, such as bank savings and/or short/long-term\n                   liquidities.12\n\n\n\n\n9    In this context, financial statements audited by a related body are not considered “externally audited\n     financial statements”.\n10   ISO/IEC 17029:2019.\n11 The liabilities arising from the potential risks may include a range of issues under the DOE’s responsibility\n\n     that might adversely impact the clients, such as the following: (a) mistakes in the validation and/ or\n     verification/certification which result in incorrect validation opinion and/or verified amount of Article 6.4\n     emission reductions; (b) delay of the validation and/or verification/certification timeline required in the\n     contract signed; (c) rejection of the request for registration and/or request for issuance made by the\n     Supervisory Body; and (d) suspension or withdrawal of accreditation status of the DOE resulting in\n     prohibition on the part of the DOE to finalize and issue any on-going validation and/or verification opinions\n     and reports.\n12 Calculation of the level of liability insurance and/or financial resource reserves may include a range of\n\n     risk assessment approaches, such as the following: (a) failure modes and effects analysis approach (i.e.\n     a product of the probability of issue, the ability to detect issue, and the impact of issue); (b) the risk matrix\n     approach (i.e. a product of the impact of issue and its frequency); and (c) the risk factor approach (i.e. a\n     product of the risk factor and the expected turnover of the DOE’s business).\n\n\n\n                                                       10 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n\n8.      Entity’s management\n8.1.    Management structure\n20.     A DOE shall have a management structure that has overall responsibility for the\n        performance and implementation of the entity's functions, including quality assurance\n        procedures and final decision-making on validations and/or verifications/certifications.\n\n21.     A DOE shall document its structure, showing lines of authority, responsibilities and\n        allocation of functions stemming from the top management. 13 It shall include the\n        management personnel, validation and verification/certification personnel, other\n        personnel involved in Article 6.4 activities and any operational or supervisory committees.\n\n22.

This committee need not intervene in or review\n                 each validation or verification/certification activity, but may need to review them in\n                 order to fulfil its mandate;\n\n         (g)     Prepare an annual synthesis report of its activities, which shall be included in the\n                 DOE’s annual report to the Supervisory Body to be submitted in accordance with\n                 the Article 6.4 accreditation procedure.\n\n\n\n14   The participation of key interested parties in an independent committee may include representatives\n     from academic organizations, civil society, industry as sociations, and local/provincial/national\n     government entities.\n\n\n\n                                                 13 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n36.       In cases where the impartiality committee identifies issues through the monitoring or\n          review of the implementation of the DOE’s systems to safeguard impartiality, it shall report\n          the instance to the DOE’s top management within seven days. If the top management\n          does not follow the advice of the impartiality committee, this committee shall report the\n          instance to the Supervisory Body through the UNFCCC secretariat within seven days.\n\n37.       The DOE shall enable the Supervisory Body, upon request, to observe meetings of the\n          impartiality committee, as part of the DOE’s accreditation process.\n\n9.4.      Safeguarding impartiality at the operational level\n\n9.4.1. Analysis of threats against impartiality\n\n38.       The DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for analysing\n          potential threats against impartiality.\n\n39.       The DOE shall ensure that the procedure referred to in paragraph 38 above requires it to\n          carry out a conflict of interest analysis at least annually and whenever a significant change\n          occurs in the DOE activities, such as changes in the organizational structure or of the legal\n          status and mergers with or acquisitions of other organizations. 15\n\n40.       The conflict-of-interest analysis shall include, but not be limited to, the following risks:16\n\n          (a)      Source of revenue – risks from a client paying for the validation or\n                   verification/certification work. This risk is significant when the DOE has numerous\n                   contracts with the same client;\n\n          (b)      Self-interest – risks from a person or an organization acting in its own interest; for\n                   example, financial self-interest;\n          (c)      Self-review – risks from a person or an organization reviewing its own work; for\n                   example, assessing the Article 6.4 validation or verification/certification activities of\n                   a client to whom the DOE or its related bodies provided consultancy would be a\n                   self-review risk;\n\n          (d)      Familiarity (or trust) – risks from a person or an organization being too familiar with\n                   or trusting of another person instead of seeking validation or\n                   verification/certification evidence;\n\n          (e)      Intimidation – risks from a person or an organization having a perception of being\n                   coerced openly or secretly, such as a risk to be replaced or reported to a\n                   supervisor.\n\n41.       In the conflict-of-interest analysis, the following activities of the DOE or its related bodies,\n          but not limited to, shall be considered as threats to impartiality:\n\n          (a)      Identification, development and/or financing of A6.4 project activities and PoAs;\n\n\n\n15 Conflict of interest analysis may include a range of risk assessment approaches, such as: (a) failure\n\n     modes and effects analysis approach (i.e. a product of the probability of threat against impartiality, the\n     ability to detect threat, and the impact of threat); and (b) the risk matrix approach (i.e. a product of the\n     impact of threat and its frequency).\n16   Annex B to ISO 14065:2007(E).\n\n\n\n                                                     14 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n        (b)     Consultancy related to A6.4 projects and PoAs;\n\n        (c)     Providing training on A6.4 projects and PoAs and other related topics;\n\n        (d)     Marketing and         tie-up   promotion    with   Article   6.4   consultancy/financing\n                organizations;\n\n        (e)     Offering/payment of commissions or other inducements for promotion or new\n                business;\n\n        (f)     Laboratory testing and calibration for A6.4 projects and PoAs;\n        (g)     Use of personnel for the validation and/or verification/certification of an A6.4 project\n                or PoA who were previously associated with the Article 6.4 activity participants in\n                their personal capacity or otherwise for any activity – for example, development,\n                consultancy, or training;\n\n        (h)     Other organizational considerations such as performance targets in financial terms\n                or in terms of a specific number of A6.4 projects and PoAs to be validated and/or\n                verified/certified during a period of time.\n\n42.     While carrying out the conflict-of-interest analysis, the DOE shall:\n\n        (a)     Evaluate sources of income and assess whether financial or other commercial\n                factors compromise impartiality;\n\n        (b)     Identify and document its actual/proposed involvement in Article 6.4 activities other\n                than validation and/or verification/certification and carry out and document an\n                analysis of actual and potential risks to impartiality;\n        (c)     Identify and document all related bodies and identify actual/potential risks to\n                impartiality, including potential conflicts arising from any such relationships;\n\n        (d)     Disclose and document, in a transparent and comprehensive manner, the following\n                information, as a minimum: the general types of activities carried out by the DOE,\n                its parent organization, outsourced entities, related bodies, and personnel.

The DOE shall not\n                state or imply that the validation and/or verification/certification of an A6.4 project\n                or PoA would be simpler, easier, faster, or less expensive if a specified\n                consultancy/financing organization is used;\n\n\n\n                                               16 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n         (f)      The DOE shall require its management personnel, top management personnel and\n                  validation and verification/certification personnel, internal and external, to reveal\n                  any potential conflict of interest known to them. The DOE shall use this information\n                  as input to identify threats to impartiality raised by the activities of such personnel\n                  or by the organizations that employ them, and shall not use such personnel,\n                  internal or external, unless any potential conflict of interests has been addressed\n                  and the measures taken to address these potential conflicts have been\n                  documented and implemented. If, during the course of a validation and/or\n                  verification/certification, such instances become known, the personnel concerned\n                  shall be removed from the validation and/or verification/certification immediately;\n\n         (g)      The DOE shall require its personnel, internal and external, to report any situation\n                  of influence or pressure from activity participants that may threaten their\n                  independence in the course of the validation and/or verification/certification of\n                  Article 6.4 project activities or PoAs. Based on such report, the DOE shall take\n                  appropriate actions to ensure its independence in its validation and/or\n                  verification/certification activities;\n\n         (h)      The DOE shall ensure that the conditions in its contracts with activity participants\n                  does not link their payments to the DOE to the nature of the validation or verification\n                  opinion. Payments may, however, be linked to the timing of the various stages of\n                  the validation or verification/certification;\n         (i)      The DOE shall ensure that the personnel involved in validation and/or\n                  verification/certification activities are bound by the DOE’s impartiality policy and act\n                  impartially in their work through contractual or employment terms and assignment\n                  terms for each validation and/or verification/certification;\n\n         (j)      The DOE shall ensure that the personnel involved in validation and/or\n                  verification/certification activities do not provide, while conducting the validation or\n                  verification/certification of an A6.4 project or PoA, any advice, consultancy, or\n                  recommendation to the activity participants on how to address any deficiencies that\n                  may be identified in the validation or verification/certification;\n\n         (k)      The DOE shall ensure that it’s operation and its personnel (internal and external)\n                  have no relationship17 with the related body of the DOE that creates threats to its\n                  impartiality;\n\n         (l)      The DOE shall ensure that all members of the validation or verification/certification\n                  team and all members of the technical review team have no conflict of interest with\n                  respect to the A6.4 project or PoA to be validated or verified and meet all\n                  impartiality requirements contained in section 9.\n\n9.5.     Review of effectiveness\n46.      The DOE shall analyse and review, at least annually, all data and information relevant to\n         impartiality, such as the conflict-of-interest analysis, the mitigation strategies and actions\n\n\n\n17   A relationship that threatens the impartiality of the AE/DOE can be based on the following but not limited\n     to ownership, governance, management, personnel, shared or partially shared resources, finances,\n     contracts, marketing and payment of a sales commission or other inducement for the referral of new\n     clients.\n\n\n\n                                                    17 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n         undertaken, any non-conformity raised with regard to impartiality, and the corrective\n         actions implemented to correct the non-conformities.\n\n47.      Based on the data/information referred to in paragraph 46 above, the DOE shall carry out,\n         at least annually, an analysis of the process to safeguard impartiality and a review of its\n         effectiveness.\n\n48.      The recommendations of actions resulting from the review of the process of safeguarding\n         impartiality shall be reported to the DOE’s top management. The DOE shall keep a record\n         of this review.\n\n10. Human resources and competence\n10.1. Sufficiency of human resources\n\n10.1.1. General\n\n49.      A DOE shall establish, document, implement and maintain a procedure for determining\n         human resources having the competence prescribed in sections 10.2 and 10.3 below in\n         order to perform its validation and/or verification/certification functions.\n\n50.      A DOE shall have sufficient human resources with the necessary competence relating to\n         the type, range, and volume of estimated/planned workload for each technical area in\n         which the DOE intends to operate or operates, within all sectoral scopes in which the DOE\n         has applied for accreditation or has been accredited.\n51.      The DOE shall ensure that the management personnel are internal resources.18\n\n52.      For functions other than management functions, a DOE may fulfil the requirement for\n         sufficient resources by:\n\n         (a)     Using internal resources; and/or\n\n         (b)     Outsourcing, as defined in paragraphs 57–65 below.\n\n53.      A DOE shall evaluate, at least annually, the sufficiency of human resources required to\n         perform its validation and/or verification/certification functions, taking into account the\n         necessary competence related to the technical area(s), geographical locations of A6.4\n         projects and PoAs, past performance of its validation and/or verification/certification\n         functions, and expected volume of its validation and/or verification/certification activities\n         for the future. The DOE shall document the evaluation conducted and its results.\n\n54.      The DOE shall ensure that the validation and verification/certification personnel,\n         irrespective of whether they are internal or external resources, are under the\n         responsibility19 of a member of the DOE’s management.\n\n\n\n\n18   Internal resources require direct employment by the AE/DOE as an employee. The physical location of\n     such personnel is inconsequential.\n19   Responsibility in this context does not refer to oversight of human resources in terms of employment,\n     but rather to the oversight of validation and verification activities.\n\n\n\n                                                 18 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n55.

A DOE may outsource functions to outsourced entities strictly in accordance with Appendix\n          1 below.22\n\n61.       If a DOE outsources one or more functions referred to in Appendix 1 below, the DOE shall\n          ensure that the outsourced entity does not further outsource this function.\n\n62.       If the outsourced entity conducts a contract review, the DOE shall ensure that the entity\n          has access to all necessary information, including the information required to conduct the\n          impartiality analysis in accordance with paragraph 90(c) below.\n\n10.1.3.2.          Outsourcing to an external individual\n63.       A DOE may use external individuals,23 who may be self-employed, part of a one-person\n          company or employed by any other company, as validators, verifiers, technical experts,\n          team leaders and technical reviewers, to supplement its internal resources, as provided\n          for in paragraph 52(b) above. In such cases, the DOE shall establish, document,\n          implement and maintain a procedure for engaging external individuals.24\n\n64.       The procedure referred to in paragraph 63 above shall require that:\n\n          (a)      The DOE has:\n\n                   (i)    A contract with the external individual if the person is self-employed or part\n                          of a one-person company; or\n\n                   (ii)   A contract with the external individual or a three-party contract with the\n                          external individual and the company that employs her/him if the person is\n                          employed by a company;\n\n          (b)      The DOE takes full responsibility for any work carried out by an external individual\n                   and obtains from the external individual a written agreement that they shall comply\n                   with all of the DOE’s applicable policies and procedures, including on\n                   confidentiality and impartiality/independence. The agreement shall explicitly\n                   require the external individual to notify the DOE of any existing or prior association\n                   with any activity participants of the A6.4 project or PoA that they may be assigned\n                   to validate or verify/certify as well as actual or potential involvement in\n                   identification, development or financing of A6.4 projects or PoAs;\n\n          (c)      The external individual is familiar with the DOE’s procedures for validation or\n                   verification/certification functions and has access to an up-to-date set of\n                   documented procedures giving relevant instructions and information on the\n                   Article 6.4 activities.\n\n\n\n22 Validator/verifier services can be availed from an outsourced entity without assigning any management\n\n     functions, such that if the outsourced entity is providing only validators/verifiers and all validators/verifiers\n     are approved and nominated from the central office and all records are available in the central office, this\n     situation does not fall under outsourcing since no function has been assigned to the outsourced entity.\n23   The use of external individuals, as described in paragraphs 62–64, shall not be considered outsourcing\n     to an entity as described in paragraphs 56–61.\n24   An external individual operates as a regular member of a validation or verification/certification team or\n     technical review team, under the supervision of the AE/DOE. A one-person team may be constituted\n     using an external individual.\n\n\n\n                                                       20 of 54\nA6.4-STAN-ACCR-001\nStandard: Article 6.4 accreditation\nVersion: 01.0\n\n\n\n65.

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, requested the Supervisory Body of the mechanism\n          established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to\n          elaborate and further develop recommendations on the application of the requirements\n          referred to in chapter V.B (titled Methodologies) of the rules, modalities and procedures\n          for the Article 6.4 mechanism (RMPs)1 for consideration and adoption by the CMA at its\n          fourth session (November 2022).\n2.        The CMA, at its fourth session, requested the Supervisory Body to elaborate and further\n          develop recommendations for consideration and adoption by the CMA at its fifth session\n          (November–December 2023). It further requested the Supervisory Body, while developing\n          the recommendations, to consider broader inputs from stakeholders provided in a\n          structured public consultation process.2\n\n1.2.      Objectives\n3.        The objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for the development and\n          assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies.\n\n2.        Entry into force\n4.        This version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024.\n\n3.        Normative references\n5.        The “shall” requirements in this document are those that the user of this document (i.e.,\n          activity participants, host Parties, stakeholders, or the Supervisory Body) is obliged to\n          meet in order to claim conformance to this document. Other types of provisions in this\n          document include recommendations (“should”), permissions (“may”), possibilities and\n          capabilities (“can”) and items for inclusion in the work plan of the Supervisory Body (“will”).\n          Besides prescriptive recommendations, explanatory information is also included in this\n          document (e.g., summarizing the basis for or reasoning behind a requirement).\n6.        Reductions in emissions, increases in removals, as well as mitigation co-benefits of\n          adaptation actions and/or economic diversification plans, are each and collectively\n          referred to as ”emission reductions or removals” (A6.4 ERs) in this document.\n7.        Mechanism projects, programmes of activities and component projects are collectively\n          referred to as “activity” or “activities” in this document.\n\n\n1\n     See decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 6(d), for the request, available at\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2021_10a01E.pdf#page_26 (English language\n     version), and the annex to 3/CMA.3 for the RMPs, contained in document\n     FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

The terms “technologies”, “measures” and “practices” are interchangeably used in this\n       document and refer to technologies, measures, and practices across all sectors.\n9.     Where scientific information is relied upon for methodologies, IPCC publications should\n       be considered as default source, if applicable and appropriate and unless more accurate\n       scientific information is available.\n\n4.     Methodology principles\n10.    Mechanism methodologies are intended to provide the basis for claim and assessment of\n       creditable emission reductions or removals, and whether activities satisfy additionality\n       requirements, and all relevant RMP and guidance from the SBM.\n11.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP applies to methodologies, and it is relevant to, inter alia,\n       baseline-setting, the avoidance of leakage, and the demonstration of additionality of\n       activities.\n12.    Paragraph 34 of the RMP sets out additional requirements, including with respect to\n       policies, national circumstances and reversals.\n13.    Paragraph 35 of the RMP frames the basic procedures for the development of\n       methodologies by host Parties, the Supervisory Body and activity participants.\n14.    Paragraph 36 of the RMP provides a choice of approaches for the baseline-setting and\n       requires the justification of the choice(s) made, including demonstration of consistency\n       with paragraph 33 of the RMP.\n15.    Paragraph 37 provides for host Parties and the Supervisory Body to develop standardized\n       baselines consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP.\n16.    Paragraph 38 of the RMP applies to the demonstration of additionality of activities and\n       identifies specific tests.\n\n4.1.   Encouraging ambition over time\n17.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall encourage\n       ambition over time (…)”.\n18.    Mechanism methodologies shall apply increasingly ambitious baselines to encourage\n       ambition of activities over time, while taking into account host Party circumstances and\n       should facilitate the deployment of low carbon solutions and technologies as described in\n       paragraphs 19 and 20 below.\n19.    Mechanism methodologies should facilitate the deployment of technologies or measures\n       that are not widely used or available in specific locations, to facilitate knowledge transfer\n       and encourage deployment of technologies or measures that reduce the cost of\n       decarbonization and unlock investment in low-carbon solutions.\n20.    Mechanism methodologies should contain provisions that facilitate the inclusion of\n       progressively more efficient and less greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive technologies,\n       replicable and scalable mitigation activities, expanding the user base, broader geographic\n       coverage, and greater penetration of low-carbon solutions after initial deployment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n4.2.   Being real, transparent, conservative, credible\n21.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) be real,\n       transparent, conservative, credible (…)”.\n22.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain credible methods for estimating emission\n       reductions or removals to ensure that the results of Article 6.4 activities represent actual\n       tonnes of GHG emissions reduced or removed. Such estimations shall be based on up-\n       to-date scientific information and reliable data.\n23.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require transparent descriptions\n       of the sources of data used, the assumptions made, the references used and the steps\n       followed in the estimation of the results of Article 6.4 activities, including equations where\n       necessary.\n24.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that ensure conservative estimation of\n       emission reductions or removals from the measures applied, options chosen, or\n       assumptions made, and which should result in conservative estimates of the emission\n       reductions or removals from Article 6.4 activities.\n25.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that Article 6.4 activities\n       have a robust monitoring, data capture and reporting system to ensure credibility. Where\n       secondary data is used, mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require\n       activity participants to provide justification that the source of data is appropriate, and the\n       data are conservative.\n26.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to ensure that all emission reductions\n       or removals, are real, transparent, conservative, and credible by:\n       (a)    Including robust, transparent and user-friendly measurement, reporting and\n              independent third-party verification systems;\n       (b)    Requiring the use of technical performance standards that are data driven;\n       (c)    Requiring transparent demonstration of changes in GHG emissions showing each\n              step in calculations and the results, and ensuring that calculated emission\n              reductions or removals are uniquely achieved by and attributable to the activity;\n       (d)    Adopting life cycle approaches and considering emissions embodied in materials\n              and products, where relevant and practicable;\n       (e)    Ensuring that information, including data sources and calculations are real,\n              transparent, conservative, accessible and credible;\n       (f)    Choosing a conservative emissions baseline when multiple sources of data and\n              parameters are available to set the baseline;\n       (g)    Including, where appropriate, the use of remote sensing and digital technologies\n              to enable transparent, accurate and credible calculation and estimation of emission\n              reductions and removals.\n\n4.3.   Establishing that the selected baseline is below business-as-usual\n27.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) be below\n       ‘business as usual’ (…)”.\n\n\n\n                                              5 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n28.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require that the baseline selected\n       for an emission reduction activity in accordance with paragraph 36 of the RMP shall be\n       demonstrated as being below ‘business-as-usual’ (BAU). BAU emissions are plausible\n       reference benchmarks or scenarios for GHG emissions prior to or in the absence of the\n       implementation of the activity. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall require\n       the identification of the BAU scenario or reference benchmark emissions and provide an\n       approach for their estimation.\n29.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require activity participants to\n       calculate the difference between the baseline emissions estimated as per the\n       requirements in section 4.6 below and BAU emissions estimated as per paragraph 28\n       above as an annual and total amount with respect to the crediting period. This shall be\n       demonstrated in the project design document and at each renewal of the crediting period.\n\n4.4.   Contributing to the equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between\n       participating Parties\n30.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall…contribute to the\n       equitable sharing of mitigation benefits between the participating Parties…”.\n31.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions for contributing to the equitable\n       sharing of mitigation benefits between participating Parties, including the application of\n       conditions specified by the Designated National Authorities (DNAs) of the host Party.\n       These may also include one or more of the provisions below:\n       (a)    Conditions to ensure that the total length of the crediting period(s) of activities is\n              shorter than the lifetime of the technology implemented including any replacements\n              undertaken during the crediting period, where there is very high confidence that\n              emission reductions from the technology continue to be achieved beyond the end\n              of crediting period(s);\n       (b)    Other approaches to fulfil the demonstration of equitable sharing of mitigation\n              benefits.\n32.    Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that ensure that the sharing of\n       mitigation benefits between participating Parties tangibly supports the sustainable\n       development objectives of host Parties, such as through the use of the SD Tool in the\n       activity design and implementation.\n33.    Mechanism methodologies shall require the estimation of the mitigation benefits to the\n       host Party, taking into account the relevant provisions in paragraph 31 above.\n\n4.5.   Aligning with the NDC of each participating Party, if applicable, its LT-LEDS,\n       if it has submitted one, the long-term temperature goal of the Paris\n       Agreement and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement\n34.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) in respect of\n       each participating Party, contribute to reducing emission levels in the host Party, and align\n       with its NDC, if applicable, its long-term low GHG emission development strategy, if it has\n       submitted one, and the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement”.\n35.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) align with the\n       long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (…)”.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n36.    Mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the activity, does not\n       constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party\n       with regard to the latest nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, if\n       applicable, its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-\n       LEDS), if it has submitted one, and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement\n       and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n4.6.   Approaches to set the baseline\n37.    Paragraph 36 of the RMP states that: “Each mechanism methodology shall require the\n       application of one of the approach(es) below to setting the baseline, while taking into\n       account any guidance by the Supervisory Body, and with justification for the\n       appropriateness of the choices, including information on how the proposed baseline\n       approach is consistent with paragraphs 33 and 35 in the RMP and recognizing that a host\n       Party may determine a more ambitious level at its discretion:\n       A performance-based approach, taking into account:\n              (i) Best available technologies that represent an economically feasible and\n              environmentally sound course of action, where appropriate;\n              (ii) An ambitious benchmark approach where the baseline is set at least at the\n              average emission level of the best performing comparable activities providing\n              similar outputs and services in a defined scope in similar social, economic,\n              environmental and technological circumstances;\n              (iii) An approach based on existing actual or historical emissions, adjusted\n              downwards to ensure alignment with paragraph 33 of the RMP.”\n38.    Paragraph 27 of the RMP states that “A host Party may specify to the Supervisory Body,\n       prior to participating in the mechanism: (a) Baseline approaches and other methodological\n       requirements…”.\n39.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions that require justification of the\n       appropriateness of the choice of approach(es) identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP for\n       setting the baseline, with reference to the requirements of paragraphs 33 and 35 of the\n       RMP.\n40.    With regard to setting the baseline for emission reduction activities, factors affecting the\n       appropriateness of the choice may include:\n       (a)    Similarity of emission sources with respect to technologies and measures applied,\n              or sectors covered by the methodology which may allow the use of an ambitious\n              benchmark covered under paragraph 36 (ii) of the RMP;\n       (b)    Availability of data required for a conservative and reliable estimation of the\n              baseline.\n41.    For the approaches identified in paragraph 36 of the RMP, mechanism methodologies\n       shall contain provisions to apply the method detailed in section 4.7 below to adjust the\n       baseline emissions downwards and to ensure consistency with paragraph 33 of the RMP.\n42.    A host Party may determine a more ambitious baseline requirement at its discretion and\n       specify it to the Supervisory Body for approval.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n4.7.   Addressing elements of paragraph 33 and paragraph 36 of the RMP\n43.    Mechanism methodologies shall address consistency of implementation of paragraph 36\n       of the RMP with the requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP through the appropriate\n       application of:\n       (a)    Downward adjustment to the baseline as per paragraph 36 (iii) of the RMP; and/or\n       (b)    Downward adjustment to the baseline resulting from or applied to the approaches\n              in paragraph 36 (i) and (ii) of the RMP, unless otherwise decided by the\n              Supervisory Body.\n44.    If the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above demonstrates a downward adjustment\n       that is greater than the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, no further\n       adjustment is required. Where the calculated difference in paragraph 29 above is less than\n       the adjustment calculated as per paragraphs 45 to 47 below, further adjustment is required\n       to align with the result of paragraphs 45 to 47 below to ensure consistency with the\n       requirements of paragraph 33 of the RMP.\n45.    Factors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment of baselines shall be included\n       in the project design document and updated at each renewal of the crediting period, in\n       accordance with paragraphs 46 to 47 below. Host Parties may decide to apply more\n       stringent factors or quantitative methods for downward adjustment, according to their\n       circumstances.\n46.    The downward adjustment shall be undertaken in a manner that considers economic\n       viability of critical mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization\n       technologies, negative emission approaches while ensuring that methodologies are\n       aligned with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.\n47.    The downward adjustment to the baseline referred to above may be operationalized\n       through:\n       (a)    Factors or quantitative methods for activities included in methodologies approved\n              by the Supervisory Body. These may be developed by all participants covered in\n              decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 35. Activity participants or stakeholders may propose\n              factors or quantitative methods for the consideration of the Supervisory Body in\n              consultation with a relevant DNA should it indicate an interest in being involved. If\n              a country specific factor or quantitative method is to be developed, the procedures\n              for the standardized baselines shall be applied;\n       (b)    Development of factors or quantitative methods, jointly by the Supervisory Body\n              and the host Party, with the provision for the host Party to make a request to the\n              Supervisory Body to initiate the development of the factors or quantitative methods.\n              The procedures for the standardized baselines may be used for this purpose; or\n       (c)    Development of factors or quantitative methods by the host Party that are specified\n              to the Supervisory Body for approval. The procedures for the standardized\n              baselines may be used for this purpose.\n\n4.8.   Encouraging broad participation\n48.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) encourage\n       broad participation (…)”.\n\n\n\n                                             8 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n49.    The Supervisory Body shall encourage development of methodologies covering a wide\n       range of emission reduction and removal activities with broad sectoral and geographic\n       coverage.\n50.    The Supervisory Body shall encourage participation of a broad range of stakeholders\n       during the methodology development process and the methodology application by\n       enabling informed consultation as described in the “Procedure: Development, revision and\n       clarification of baseline and monitoring methodologies and methodological tools”.\n51.    Mechanism methodologies shall:\n       (a)    Contain provisions that uphold stringency and encourage broad participation by\n              being accurate, simple, clear, and avoiding complexity such that a wide range of\n              activity participants and host Parties can apply the methodology requirements\n              irrespective of a Party’s scientific infrastructure, financial and national\n              circumstances;\n       (b)    Contain provisions that take into account the context on the ground in host Parties,\n              particularly in least developed countries and small island developing States;\n       (c)    Contain provisions that take into account the knowledge and practices of local\n              communities and Indigenous Peoples;\n       (d)    Permit the use of multiple data sources to address data gaps, and the use of\n              conservative default values and/or use of benchmarked data from comparable\n              regions to the extent they can be applicable;\n       (e)    Use simple language that is inclusive, gender-sensitive, and accessible to a wide\n              range of stakeholders, including local communities and Indigenous Peoples to the\n              extent possible.\n\n4.9.   Including data sources, accounting for uncertainty and monitoring\n       requirements\n52.    Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall include relevant\n       assumptions, parameters, data sources and key factors (…)”.\n53.    The Supervisory Body shall ensure that mechanism methodologies are transparent and\n       comprehensible with respect to included assumptions, parameters, data sources and key\n       factors.\n54.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain or reference provisions that require the\n       accounting of uncertainty associated with emission factors, activity data and other\n       estimation parameters applied in the calculation of emission reductions or removals\n       consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines.\n55.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions requiring a listing of data parameters\n       that need to be monitored throughout the crediting period. This may include the data that\n       are directly measured where necessary on a sample basis, and the data that are collected\n       from other sources such as official statistics, expert judgment, IPCC guidelines, and\n       scientific literature. In this regard, methodologies shall contain provisions on monitoring\n       plans related to the collection, open publication and storing of all relevant data needed to\n       estimate baseline, project and leakage emissions, including provisions related to quality\n       assurance and quality control.\n\n\n\n                                             9 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n4.10. Recognizing suppressed demand\n56.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) recognize\n       suppressed demand (…)”.\n57.    Suppressed demand in the context of an Article 6.4 activity is a situation where services\n       provided to a population are insufficient to meet the basic human needs such as minimum\n       amount of electricity for lighting, heating or cooling due to barriers, including low income\n       or lack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting such\n       needs requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline scenarios.\n58.    The Supervisory Body will recognize suppressed demand under a situation where the\n       BAU cannot realistically provide the level of service required of the Article 6.4 activity by\n       considering that the baseline scenario is not set based on the historical and continuation\n       of the current condition, but rather based on an alternative that provides a level of service\n       comparable to that provided by the Article 6.4 activity.\n59.    The Supervisory Body shall recognize suppressed demand by including benchmarks and\n       default factors in specific methodologies that may not be below BAU.\n\n4.11. Taking into account policies and measures and relevant circumstances\n60.    Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) take into\n       account (…) policies and measures, and relevant circumstances, including national,\n       regional or local, social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances (…)”.\n61.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to take into account relevant\n       circumstances, including national, regional, or local, social, economic, environmental and\n       technological, based on robust data and verifiable information. In this regard, the type of\n       data and information that would be necessary to meet the above provisions shall be\n       specified in the methodologies, particularly with regard to eligibility conditions, setting the\n       baseline, and demonstrating additionality.\n\n4.12. Standardized baselines\n62.    Paragraph 37 of the RMP states that “Standardized baselines may be developed by the\n       Supervisory Body at the request of the host Party or may be developed by the host Party\n       and approved by the Supervisory Body. Standardized baselines shall be established at\n       the highest possible level of aggregation in the relevant sector of the host Party and be\n       consistent with paragraph 33 of the RMP.”\n63.    A standardized baseline is a baseline developed at the request of or by a host Party or a\n       group of host Parties on a subnational, national, or group-of-Parties basis rather than on\n       an activity basis to facilitate the determination of the baseline, calculation of the GHG\n       emission reductions or removals and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4\n       activities, while ensuring environmental integrity within the scope of the standardized\n       baseline.\n64.    The application of standardized baselines is not mandatory unless explicitly stated in an\n       approved standardized baseline or in another standard approved by the Supervisory\n       Body. When the application of a standardized baseline is not mandatory, activity\n       participants may establish additionality or baseline emissions for their activity using other\n       approved approaches as an alternative to applying a standardized baseline.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n65.    A host Party may specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory\n       requirement for the activities implemented in the host Party. The Supervisory Body may\n       also specify the application of a standardized baseline as a mandatory requirement for\n       certain cases such as when the standardized baseline is being used to address leakage\n       emissions of an activity, as further detailed in section 6 below. The provisions in this\n       paragraph may also apply to standardized baselines developed by or for a group of host\n       Parties.\n66.    The approaches for setting the baselines referred to in section 4.6 above shall also be\n       applied for the development of standardized baselines.\n67.    The host Party and the Supervisory Body should determine the level of aggregation taking\n       into account the following:\n       (a)    A default level of aggregation shall comprise the facilities or equipment producing\n              a similar type of output within the geographical boundaries of one Party or a\n              specific subregion determined by the Party. The level of aggregation may be\n              expanded to a group of Parties with similar circumstances relating to the output;\n       (b)    A default group of facilities should be disaggregated when significant dissimilarities\n              exist in the performance of facilities or groups of facilities in the country/region. In\n              this case, the disaggregation shall be carried out according to relevant criteria,\n              such as scale of production, installed capacity or age of the facilities. Standardized\n              baseline values should be determined for each group of similar facilities in this\n              case;\n       (a)    Disaggregation should not result in standardized baselines with overlapping\n              applicability.\n68.    Standardized baselines shall include a default validity period of three years, starting from\n       the date of approval by the Supervisory Body. A host Party may propose a shorter or\n       longer validity period, taking into account the specificity of sectors in which activities are\n       undertaken, and by providing justification for the consideration of the Supervisory Body.\n69.    After the validity of a standardized baseline has expired, the updated standardized\n       baseline can be submitted by the host Party for the consideration of the Supervisory Body\n       for approval. An updated standardized baseline shall not impact registered activities\n       applying the previous version up to the end of their current crediting period.\n70.    Standardized baselines may be developed by the host Party and approved by the\n       Supervisory Body following an assessment against the “Procedure: Development,\n       revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”.\n\n5.     Additionality demonstration\n71.    Paragraph 38 of the RMP states that “Each mechanism methodology shall specify the\n       approach to demonstrating the additionality of the activity. Additionality shall be\n       demonstrated using a robust assessment that shows the activity would not have occurred\n       in the absence of the incentives from the mechanism, taking into account all relevant\n       national policies, including legislation, and representing mitigation that exceeds any\n       mitigation that is required by law or regulation, and taking a conservative approach that\n       avoids locking in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices\n       incompatible with paragraph 33 of the RMP”.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n72.    Paragraph 39 of the RMP states that “The Supervisory Body may apply simplified\n       approaches for demonstration of additionality for any least developed country or small\n       island developing State at the request of that Party, in accordance with requirements\n       developed by the Supervisory Body”.\n73.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to demonstrate additionality through;\n       prior consideration of the benefits of the mechanism, regulatory analysis, the avoidance\n       of lock-in as well as through financial additionality complemented with a common practice\n       analysis. Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in\n       paragraph 77 below.\n74.    Demonstration of the consideration of the benefits from the Article 6.4 mechanism as\n       necessary in the decision to implement the activity shall be performed in accordance with\n       the Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects.\n75.    Regulatory analysis shall require demonstration that the proposed activity represents\n       mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or regulation unless the law\n       or regulation refers to or formally integrates the mechanism as an instrument for\n       implementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity that may require a\n       certain technological, performance or management action shall be considered, noting that\n       regulatory environments vary.\n76.    Avoidance of lock-in shall require demonstration that the proposed activity avoids locking\n       in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon-intensive practices incompatible with\n       paragraph 33 of the RMP, including through an assessment of the scale, lifetime, and\n       emissions intensity of the activity;\n77.    Financial additionality can be proved either by:\n       (a)    Demonstration that the proposed activity would not have occurred in the absence\n              of the incentives from the mechanism through an investment analysis (default\n              approach); or\n       (b)    Assessment of barriers to the implementation of the activity, such as financial and\n              institutional barriers, first of its kind, taking into account all relevant national\n              policies, including legislation and current practices within the activity sector and\n              geographic area including Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws.\n              To demonstrate additionality for their activity, through barrier analysis, activity\n              participants shall:\n              (i)    Describe the barriers, including the reasons why investment analysis is not\n                     sufficient; and\n              (ii)   Evidence the barriers and how the mechanism will help overcome the\n                     barriers.\n       (c)    A common practice analysis to complement the investment and barrier analysis by\n              demonstrating that the measure or technology is not already widespread through\n              an analysis of the extent to which the proposed project type (e.g. technology or\n              practice) has already diffused in the relevant sector and region.\n78.    Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to provisions in paragraph\n       77 above, subject to applicability conditions. The use of such approaches by an activity\n       shall require demonstration of the following, inter alia:\n       (a)    the use of baseline approach(es) in paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) of the RMPs;\n\n\n                                             12 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n       (b)    that the technologies or practices applied in the activity outperform an ambitious\n              threshold for emissions or emissions reductions, market penetration, or other\n              unique characteristics, set at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the\n              RMPs.\n79.    When formulating an approach to demonstrate the additionality, the Supervisory Body\n       shall take into account any communication from the host Party regarding paragraph 80\n       below.\n80.    When formulating an approach to the demonstration of additionality, including for\n       paragraph 76 above, mechanism methodologies should consider the relevant\n       circumstances, including national, regional or local, social, economic, environmental and\n       technological circumstances, in line with paragraphs 60 and 61 above, including Party-led\n       identification of activities that may be transformative.\n\n6.     Leakage\n81.    Paragraph 33 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) avoid leakage,\n       where applicable (…)”.\n82.    Leakage refers to anthropogenic emissions by sources of GHGs that occur outside the\n       activity boundary which are attributable to the Article 6.4 activity.\n83.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to:\n       (a)    Ensure that the potential sources of leakage in activities covered by a mechanism\n              methodology are identified, including, but not limited to, any sources referred to in\n              paragraph 84 below;\n       (b)    Require activities to avoid or minimize all sources of leakage by applying the\n              appropriate approach(es) referred to in paragraph 85 below, including addressing\n              any remaining leakage by discounting credited volumes as described in paragraph\n              85(a) below;\n       (c)    Require that activity participants list all potential sources of leakage that may\n              reasonably be attributable to the activity and describe how each is being\n              addressed. If the activity participant excludes any source of leakage from\n              consideration, they shall justify its exclusion;\n       (d)    Include provisions for robust, transparent and user-friendly measurement,\n              reporting and independent third-party verification systems that encompass specific\n              sources of potential leakage identified;\n       (e)    Include, where necessary, life cycle analysis of products or material in relation to\n              the source indicated in paragraph 84(d) below;\n       (f)    Require the activity participant to take into account relevant information from the\n              DNA of the host Party on leakage, where available and as per the application of\n              the tool developed by the Supervisory Body.\n84.    Leakage may occur due to, inter alia:\n       (a)    Continued use of baseline equipment being transferred beyond the activity\n              boundary;\n\n\n\n\n                                              13 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n         (b)     Use of resources that have competing uses from activities outside the activity\n                 boundary that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary or shifts of\n                 pre-project activities that lead to a net change in emissions outside the boundary;\n         (c)     Diversion of existing production processes or services accounted for in the\n                 baseline, inter alia through relocation and continuation of baseline activities outside\n                 the activity boundary;\n         (d)     Impacts on upstream and downstream processes associated with the materials\n                 and services used by the activity, and/or products or services provided by the\n                 activity, relative to the baseline, unless they are accounted as activity emissions.\n85.      Leakage shall be avoided and, where not possible, minimized, or addressed, by, inter alia:\n         (a)     Discounting credited volumes: deducting emission reductions from credited\n                 volumes taking into account equipment lifetime, where applicable;\n         (b)     Scrapping of baseline equipment: undertaking and                       evidencing   the\n                 destruction/decommissioning/disposal of baseline equipment;\n         (c)     Application of higher-level elements: applying a standardized baseline at a\n                 higher level of aggregation (or equivalent) that is regularly updated and any\n                 associated higher-level monitoring information and/or system;\n         (d)     Nesting: Aligning relevant aspects of activity design and implementing activities\n                 together with an existing higher-level crediting programme;\n         (e)     Upscaling implementation: implementing activities at a higher level (e.g.\n                 sectoral, subnational, or national).\n86.      For some types of activities, monitoring and use of a standardized baseline (or equivalent)\n         at national scale or jurisdictional level is necessary to quantify and account for leakage.\n87.      For those activities falling under the scope of Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Paris\n         Agreement, mechanism methodologies shall require, in addition to all relevant\n         requirements adopted by the Supervisory Body3, demonstration that the activity is included\n         in all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, noting\n         this is consistent with the application of the approaches described in paragraph 85 (c) and\n         (e).\n\n7.       Non-permanence and reversals\n88.      Paragraph 34 of the RMP states that “Mechanism methodologies shall (…) address\n         reversals, where applicable”.\n89.      Mechanism methodologies shall address reversals of removals and emission reductions\n         using an approach consistent with the standard on requirements for activities involving\n         removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n                                                  -----\n\n\n\n\n3\n    See also document Article 6.4 activity standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-002) available at\n    https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf.\n\n\n                                                 14 of 15\nA6.4-STAN-METH-001\nStandard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and\nassessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n                                   Document information\n\nVersion      Date                  Description\n\n\n01.1         26 February 2025      Editorial revision to correct formatting and a cross reference in\n                                   paragraph 80.\n01.0         9 October 2024        SBM 014, Annex 5.\n                                   Initial adoption.\nDecision Class: Regulatory\nDocument Type: Standard\nBusiness Function: Methodology\nKeywords: A6.4 mechanism, developing and assessing methodologies, methodologies\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15 of 15\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), by its decision 3/CMA.3 “Rules, modalities and procedures for the\n          mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement”, paragraph\n          6(c), requested the Supervisory Body of the mechanism established by Article 6,\n          paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement (Article 6.4 mechanism) to elaborate and further\n          develop, on the basis of the rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism\n          (RMP), recommendations on activities involving removals, including appropriate\n          monitoring, reporting, accounting for removals and crediting periods, addressing\n          reversals, avoidance of leakage, and avoidance of other negative environmental and\n          social impacts, in addition to the activities referred to in chapter V of the RMP (Article 6,\n          paragraph 4, activity cycle), to be considered at its fourth session (November 2022). 1\n2.        In response to this request, the Supervisory Body agreed on the recommendations on\n          activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism contained in the annex to\n          the addendum of its annual report to the CMA at its fourth session2.\n3.        The CMA, by its decision 7/CMA.4, paragraphs 19 and 20, invited Parties and admitted\n          observer organizations to submit, via the submission portal, by 15 March 2023, their views\n          on activities involving removals and requested the Supervisory Body to consider the views\n          of Parties and observers in elaborating and further developing recommendations on\n          activities involving removals, while taking into account the mandate provided to the\n          Supervisory Body contained in paragraph 24(a)(ix) of the RMP, and considering broader\n          inputs from stakeholders provided in a structured public consultation process.\n4.        Based on the request of the CMA in its decisions 3/CMA.3 and 7/CMA.4 and considering\n          views of Parties and observers as well as inputs from stakeholders, the Supervisory Body\n          agreed on the updated recommendation to the CMA as contained in the addendum of its\n          annual report to the CMA at its fifth session.3\n5.        The CMA, at its fifth session, requested the Supervisory Body to continue the relevant\n          work to operationalize the mechanism with a view to elaborating and further developing\n          recommendations for consideration and adoption at CMA 6.\n\n\n\n\n1\n     Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/460950.\n2\n     Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2022/6/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/621980.\n3\n     Document FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15/Add.1 available at https://unfccc.int/documents/632332.\n\n\n\n                                                 3 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n1.2.   Objectives\n6.     The objective of the standard is to set out the requirements for activities involving removals\n       under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n2.     Entry into force\n7.     This version of this standard enters into force on 9 October 2024.\n\n3.     Context of removals under this standard\n3.1.   Context\n8.     Relevant extracts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth\n       Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (WGIII) definitions of activities involving\n       removals include the following:\n       (a)     Anthropogenic removals as the withdrawal of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the\n               atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. (IPCC AR6 WGIII report,\n               glossary);\n       (b)     Carbon dioxide removal (CO2; CDR) as anthropogenic activities removing CO2\n               from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean\n               reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic\n               enhancement of biological, geochemical or chemical CO2 sinks, but excludes\n               natural CO2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. (IPCC AR-6 WG III\n               report, technical summary).\n\n3.2.   Definitions\n9.     For this document,\n       (a)     Removals are the outcomes of processes by which greenhouse gases are\n               removed from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities and are\n               either destroyed or durably stored through anthropogenic activities;\n       (b)     Activities involving removals meet the requirements referred to in paragraph 10.\n               Any examples in this standard relating to specific activity types or categories are\n               for illustrative purposes only and do not have the force of decisions by the\n               Supervisory Body regarding their use under the Article 6.4 mechanism, unless\n               explicitly so stated;\n       (c)     Removals eligible for crediting are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for\n               removals;\n       (d)     Reversals are as defined in section 4.4 Accounting for removals;\n       (e)     Avoidable reversals are reversals caused by factors over which the activity\n               participants have influence or control;\n       (f)     Unavoidable reversals are reversals caused by factors over which the activity\n               participants have no influence or control.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n4.       Requirements\n10.      Activities involving removals and emission reduction activities with reversal risks under the\n         Article 6.4 mechanism shall meet the requirements contained in the following sections, all\n         the applicable standards and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism and any further\n         requirements approved by the Supervisory Body in this regard.\n\n4.1.     Monitoring\n11.      Activity participants shall4 ensure that monitoring of removals is carried out based on data\n         derived from measurements, sampling, remote sensing, third party sources and published\n         literature that are robust and statistically representative, conservative and take appropriate\n         account of the associated uncertainties.\n12.      Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions that specify the monitoring approaches\n         for all parameters necessary to calculate removals according to the types of removal\n         activities.\n13.      Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the net removals are calculated in a\n         conservative manner, taking due account of the associated uncertainties.\n14.      To allow for flexibility in monitoring, default values may be used in the calculation of\n         removals provided that the use of the default values results in a conservative estimate of\n         net removals, taking due account of the associated uncertainties.\n15.      Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for appropriate quality assurance and\n         quality control measures, such as cross-checking of monitoring results with other data\n         sources and published literature, or calibration of measuring equipment at regular\n         intervals.\n16.      Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions for monitoring and mitigating any risks\n         identified in section 4.6.1 Reversal risk assessment, and any risks identified in the\n         Sustainable development tool of the Article 6.4 mechanism, including through the free,\n         prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples directly or indirectly affected by the\n         activity.\n17.      Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions requiring the activity participants to\n         submit a monitoring plan as part of the project design document submitted with the request\n         for registration. The monitoring plan shall be reviewed and updated at the beginning of\n         each renewed crediting period and in any of the following circumstances:\n         (a)    The designated operational entity (DOE) or the Supervisory Body identifies the\n                need to revise the monitoring plan based on any concerns identified with the\n                monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;\n         (b)    Additional risk factors are identified following a reversal that are not included or are\n                not adequately addressed in the monitoring plan and the risk assessment plan;\n\n\n\n\n4\n    For normative references, refer to section Normative reference of the Standard: Application of the\n    requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the development and assessment of Article 6.4\n    mechanism methodologies.\n\n\n\n                                                5 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (c)     The applicable national or regional regulations require the consideration of risk\n               factors that are not included or are not adequately addressed in the monitoring\n               plan and the risk assessment plan.\n\n4.2.   Reporting\n18.    Activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report after implementing the monitoring\n       activities specified in the monitoring plan.\n19.    Monitoring reports shall be based on the monitoring plan contained in the registered\n       activity design document and shall include:\n       (a)     A description of the monitoring activities and methods used;\n       (b)     The estimated net removals occurring during the monitoring period, together with\n               the associated uncertainty;\n       (c)     Data collected, including the remote sensing data, or if the data set is too large, a\n               summary of the data and an indication of how the full data set can be accessed;\n       (d)     Records and logs of the observed events of GHG release that potentially could\n               have led to the reversal of removals along with a summary of the GHG release\n               notifications referred to in paragraph 43 that were submitted during the period\n               covered by the monitoring report;\n       (e)     Information on how the risks of reversal were assessed and addressed, consistent\n               with the risk mitigation measures described in the registered project design\n               document;\n       (f)     Information on how any negative environmental and social impacts have been\n               assessed, mitigated, and managed, consistent with the measures described in the\n               registered project design document.\n20.    Monitoring reports shall be prepared without a gap between the two consecutive\n       monitoring periods, which may be of equal or different duration.\n21.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify the frequency of submission of the monitoring\n       reports, based on the nature, the type and the risk of reversals associated with the activity\n       involving removals identified through the application of necessary standards and tools.\n       The specified frequency shall include the following elements:\n       (a)     The maximum permissible interval between the start date of the first crediting\n               period and the submission of the first monitoring report shall be between one and\n               five years;\n       (b)     The maximum permissible interval between the submission of two consecutive\n               monitoring reports after the first monitoring report shall be between one and five\n               years.\n22.    The activity participants may choose a shorter time period than the time period specified\n       in paragraph 21.\n23.    In addition to the monitoring reports referred to in paragraph 21, a monitoring report shall\n       also be submitted following the observation of an event of GHG release that could\n       potentially lead to a reversal, as specified in paragraph 47.\n\n\n\n\n                                                6 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n24.    The activity participants may request the Supervisory Body, providing a transparent and\n       verifiable justification, to extend the due date for submission of a monitoring report beyond\n       the due date determined in accordance with paragraphs 21 to 23. The Supervisory Body\n       shall consider the request for the extension of the due date and shall either grant or refuse\n       such an extension.\n\n25.    If the activity participants fail to submit a monitoring report by the due date determined in\n       accordance with paragraphs 21 to 24, the operations of issuance, transfer, and\n       cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity for which the monitoring report was due\n       shall be suspended, and there may be other consequences as determined by the\n       Supervisory Body in its guidance on and procedures for addressing late, incomplete, or\n       missing monitoring report submissions.\n\n4.3.   Post-crediting period monitoring and reporting\n26.    Monitoring shall continue after the end of the last active crediting period of the activity to\n       assess whether any reversals have occurred, quantify the amount of reversals and confirm\n       the continued storage of the GHGs.\n27.    No A6.4ERs shall be issued for the net removals occurring during the post-crediting\n       monitoring period.\n28.    The activity participants may request the Supervisory Body to allow termination of the\n       post-crediting monitoring if they can demonstrate, by providing transparent and verifiable\n       information, that:\n       (a)     The stored GHGs are at a negligible risk of reversal; or\n       (b)     The potential future reversals are remediated in accordance with the provisions of\n               section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals.\n\n4.4.   Accounting for removals\n29.    Accounting for removals shall be undertaken in a consistent unit of measurement.\n30.    Removals eligible for crediting shall be determined as follows:\n       (a)     The net change in greenhouse gas storage shall be calculated by subtracting the\n               sum of the change in greenhouse gas stored in each applicable greenhouse gas\n               reservoir in the baseline scenario from the sum of the change in greenhouse gas\n               stored in each applicable greenhouse gas reservoir in the activity scenario,\n               calculated from the start date of the period covered by a monitoring report to the\n               end date of the same period;\n       (b)     The net change in emissions, not including any greenhouse gas storage losses\n               from the greenhouse gas reservoirs referred to in paragraph (a), shall be calculated\n               by subtracting the total emissions in the baseline scenario from the total emissions in the\n               activity scenario, calculated from the start date of the period covered by a\n               monitoring report to the end date of the same period;\n       (c)     If the net change in greenhouse gas storage is positive, then the number of\n               A6.4ERs issued to the activity is calculated by combining the following terms\n               (herein referred to as net removals):\n               (i)    The net change in greenhouse gas storage, specified in paragraph (a);\n\n\n\n                                                7 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n               (ii)    Minus (-) the net change in emissions, specified in paragraph (b);\n               (iii)   Minus (-) any applicable leakage effects;\n               (iv)    Minus (-) any crediting deficit, specified in paragraph (d);\n       (d)     If the calculation in paragraph (c) is negative, then no A6.4ERs shall be issued for\n               the period covered by that monitoring report and the negative number shall be\n               recorded as a crediting deficit and included in future A6.4ER issuance calculations;\n       (e)     If the net change in greenhouse gas storage is negative, then there is a reversal\n               of an equivalent quantity (herein referred to as reversals).\n31.    Only the positive net changes in GHG storage referred to in paragraph 30 that are directly\n       anthropogenic shall be eligible for crediting.\n32.    A carbon pool, a GHG reservoir or a greenhouse gas may be optionally excluded from\n       accounting if it is demonstrated, through transparent and verifiable information, that such\n       exclusion results in a more conservative calculation of the net removals.\n33.    The calculation referred to in paragraph 30 shall be carried out for each year of the post-\n       crediting monitoring period.\n34.    Where an activity involving removals also results in emission reductions, the accounting\n       of removals and emission reductions shall be separated in the monitoring report in\n       accordance with the methodology applicable to the activity.\n\n4.5.   Methodologies applicable for a renewed crediting period\n35.    At the renewal of the crediting period, the activity participants shall apply the latest version\n       of the applicable methodology.\n\n4.6.   Addressing reversals\n36.    The activity participants shall prevent and minimize the risk of reversals. The reversal of\n       removals in respect of which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated in\n       accordance with the provisions of section 4.6.3 Remediation of reversals.\n\n4.6.1. Reversal risk assessment\n37.    The risks of reversals may be related to, inter alia:\n       (a)     Activity finance and management, asset ownership, rising opportunity costs;\n       (b)     Regulatory uncertainty and social instability, political, governance and legal risks,\n               acts of terrorism, crime, and war;\n       (c)     Natural disturbances and extreme events such as fires, pests, and droughts,\n               hurricanes, floods, and landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, geological\n               faults, and fractures;\n       (d)     Climate change impacts exacerbating any of the above risks.\n38.    Activity participants shall conduct a risk assessment, which shall include a risk mitigation\n       plan, for an activity involving removals, using the reversal risk assessment tool to identify,\n       assess and mitigate reversal risks, and calculate an overall percentage-based risk rating\n\n\n\n                                                 8 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       (hereinafter referred to as risk rating) that accounts for both avoidable and unavoidable\n       reversals, taking into account, inter alia, the nature, magnitude, likelihood, and duration of\n       the risks.\n39.    The percentage-based risk rating calculated in paragraph 38 above shall inform:\n       (a)     The proportion of A6.4ERs to be transferred to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool\n               Account;\n       (b)     Identification of A6.4ERs with a negligible risk of reversal which shall be tagged in\n               the mechanism registry.\n40.    The risk assessment and the related information referred to in paragraphs 37 and 38\n       above shall form part of the project design document submitted with the request for\n       registration.\n41.    Activity participants shall review and revise the risk assessment every five years from the\n       start of the first crediting period and in any of the circumstances referred to in\n       paragraph 17.\n42.    The risk assessment and related reporting shall in addition to the above follow any further\n       guidance to be developed on risk rating and any upper limits to the risk rating.\n\n4.6.2. Reversal-related notifications and actions\n\n43.    The activity participants shall notify the Supervisory Body of any observed event involving\n       the release of stored GHGs that could potentially lead to a reversal (hereinafter referred\n       to as “the observed event”) within 30 days of becoming aware of the event. The\n       notification, which may be in digital form, shall include a brief description of the event,\n       including the date or the dates of its occurrence and its location.\n44.    Upon the receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 43, the Supervisory Body shall\n       instruct the mechanism registry administrator to suspend the operations of issuance,\n       transfer, and cancellation of A6.4ERs resulting from the activity involving removals.\n45.    The activity participants shall prepare a preliminary assessment report, containing\n       information referred to in paragraphs 19(a)-(c) in order to determine whether the observed\n       event has resulted in an actual reversal. If the observed event is an ongoing event, the\n       preliminary assessment report shall be prepared after the event has ended or has been\n       fully contained.\n46.    If the preliminary assessment report referred to in paragraph 45 concludes, on the basis\n       of transparent and verifiable evidence, that the observed event did not result in an actual\n       reversal, the report shall be verified by the DOE and submitted to the Supervisory Body\n       within 90 days of the end of the observed event. If the Supervisory Body approves the\n       preliminary assessment report, it shall notify the activity participants of such approval and\n       shall instruct the mechanism registry administrator to resume the suspended registry\n       operations referred to in paragraph 44.\n47.    If the Supervisory Body does not approve the preliminary assessment report, or if the\n       preliminary assessment report concludes that the observed event has resulted in an actual\n       reversal, the activity participants shall prepare a monitoring report in accordance with\n\n\n\n\n                                                9 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       paragraph 19 and, after its verification by the DOE, shall submit the monitoring report to\n       the Supervisory Body within 365 days of the end of the observed event.\n48.    Upon receipt of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the Supervisory Body\n       shall assess the monitoring report and determine whether the report accurately estimates\n       the magnitude of the reversal and correctly characterizes it as avoidable or unavoidable,\n       and, based on that determination, proceed to take the actions described in section 4.6.3\n       Remediation of reversals.\n49.    Following the submission of the monitoring report referred to in paragraph 47, the activity\n       participants shall review and update the risk assessment of the activity and revise the risk\n       rating of the activity as necessary. This shall result in increased contribution to the\n       Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account if there is an increase in the risk rating and require the\n       development of plans to prevent further releases of GHGs.\n50.    The activity participants shall also review the compliance with the requirements and\n       safeguards contained in the Sustainable development tool, taking into account any\n       negative environmental and social impacts caused by the reversal and developing plans\n       to prevent the recurrence of such negative environmental and social impacts.\n51.    The activity participants shall remain responsible for the implementation of the activity,\n       including carrying out the processes, actions and measures required by this section.\n\n4.6.3. Remediation of reversals\n52.    Reversals of removals for which A6.4ERs have been issued shall be fully remediated by\n       taking measures described in this section and any other further relevant guidance from\n       the Supervisory Body. The measures are intended to effectively address reversals and\n       maintain incentives for activity participants to proactively mitigate reversal risks and avoid\n       reversals.\n\n4.6.3.1.       Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account operations and contributions\n53.    The Supervisory Body shall establish a Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account in the\n       mechanism registry which serves to remediate avoidable and unavoidable reversals in full\n       through cancellation of an equivalent amount and authorization status (authorized A6.4ER\n       or Mitigation Contribution Unit) of Buffer A6.4ERs. The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account\n       shall aggregate all contributions of Buffer A6.4ERs.\n54.    The Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account shall be administered and shall only be accessed\n       by the Article 6.4 mechanism registry administrator. The composition of the Reversal Risk\n       Buffer Pool Account, including the share of A6.4ERs by vintage, region and country, type\n       of activity, authorization status, risk rating, and methodology, shall be published annually.\n55.    Upon issuance of all A6.4ERs, an amount of A6.4ERs proportionate to the issuing\n       activity’s risk rating for both avoidable and unavoidable reversals shall be forwarded to the\n       Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account. A6.4ERs forwarded to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool\n       Account shall become Buffer A6.4ERs. Buffer A6.4ERs shall only be cancelled and shall\n       not be further transferred.\n56.    Following a reversal event and the Supervisory Body’s review of a full monitoring report\n       that reflects reversals, the Supervisory Body will immediately notify the mechanism\n       registry administrator of the results of its review and the amount and type of Buffer\n       A6.4ERs required for remediation.\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n57.    The mechanism registry administrator shall immediately notify the activity participants,\n       effect the cancellation of Buffer A6.4ERs equal to the amount of reversals, and shall\n       indicate the purpose of cancellation for remediation of reversals in the mechanism registry.\n58.    For avoidable reversals, for which A6.4ERs have been cancelled from the Reversal Risk\n       Buffer Pool Account, activity participants shall be fully liable for replenishing the Reversal\n       Risk Buffer Pool Account by forwarding the equivalent amount and type (authorized\n       A6.4ER or Mitigation Contribution Unit) of A6.4ERs to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool\n       Account within a timeframe to be specified by the Supervisory Body.\n59.    Activity participants should obtain and maintain sufficient coverage under an insurance\n       policy or comparable guarantee products to cover the risk that avoidable reversals occur.\n60.    The Supervisory Body shall oversee a regular stress-test of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool\n       Account to assess the resilience of the pool to a range of reversal risk scenarios and to\n       consider and implement any potential remedial actions necessary to manage risks to the\n       robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account.\n61.    The stress-test shall assess the resilience of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account to a\n       range of reversal risk scenarios based on, inter alia, the range of risk ratings as well as\n       significant loss event(s), affecting the activities linked to the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool\n       Account. The stress-test shall occur at least every three years and in an event of a\n       significant loss event.\n62.    The Supervisory Body will consider and implement any potential remedial actions\n       necessary to manage risks to the robustness of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account,\n       including ongoing consideration of measures to remediate reversals and ensure the\n       resilience, sufficiency, and solvency of the Reversal Risk Buffer Pool Account, and other\n       appropriate measures and procedures that may provide suitable alternative means to\n       remediate reversals, including the following:\n       (a)     Requirements and approval procedures for the use of insurance policies, or\n               comparable guarantee products, or third-party guarantee approved by the\n               Supervisory Body to cover the risk that reversals occur;\n       (b)     Procedures for establishing, managing, and using a monetary permanence reserve\n               enabling remediation of reversals through the direct or potentially centralized\n               purchase and cancellation of A6.4ERs with negligible or no reversal risk.\n\n4.6.3.2.       Avoidable versus unavoidable reversals\n63.    Mechanism methodologies shall, in addition to the above, follow further guidance\n       developed by the Supervisory Body on avoidable and unavoidable reversals.\n\n4.7.   Avoidance of leakage\n64.    The activity participants shall address the risk of leakage and account for any residual\n       leakage in calculation of net removals in accordance with the requirements set out in\n       “Standard: Application of the requirements of Chapter V.B (Methodologies) for the\n       development and assessment of Article 6.4 mechanism methodologies”, The\n       methodologies and associated tools may include additional requirements for specific types\n       of removal activities.\n\n\n\n\n                                                11 of 12\nA6.4-STAN-METH-002\nStandard: Requirements for activities involving removals under the Article 6.4 mechanism\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n4.8.          Avoidance of other negative environmental and social impacts and\n              respecting human rights and the rights of Indigenous Peoples\n65.           The activity participants shall apply robust social and environmental safeguards to\n              minimize and, where possible, avoid negative environmental and social impacts of the\n              activity in accordance with the requirements contained in:\n              (a)   Article 6.4 sustainable development tool5;\n              (b)   Article 6.4 mechanism activity standard6;\n              (c)   Article 6.4 mechanism activity cycle procedure for projects 7 , including the\n                    provisions for local and global stakeholder consultation contained therein;\n              (d)   Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism8;\n              (e)   Any other relevant provisions developed by the Supervisory Body in this regard.\n\n                                                            -----\n\n                                          Document information\n\n    Version            Date                   Description\n\n\n    01.0               9 October 2024         SBM 014, Annex 6.\n                                              Initial adoption.\n    Decision Class: Regulatory\n    Document Type: Standard\n    Business Function: Methodology\n    Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, emission removal activities, methodologies\n\n\n\n\n5\n     See Article 6.4 sustainable development tool (A6.4-TOOL-AC-001) available at\n     https://webcms.unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-TOOL-AC-001.pdf.\n6\n     See Article 6.4 activity standard for projects (A6.4-STAN-AC-002) available at\n     https://webcms.unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-AC-002.pdf.\n7\n    See Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects (A6.4-PROC-AC-002) available at\n    https://webcms.unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-AC-002.pdf.\n8\n    See Appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism procedure (A6.4-PROC-GOV-\n    006) available at https://webcms.unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-PROC-GOV-006.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                    12 of 12\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Scope\n1.        This standard sets out the requirements for mechanism methodologies with regard to\n          demonstrating additionality. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies\n          in developing methodologies and by the UNFCCC Secretariat, the Methodological Expert\n          Panel (MEP) and the Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism\n          methodologies for approval. The standard is not intended for the preparation of project\n          design documents (PDDs) or monitoring reports.\n2.        Requirements relating to demonstrating the consideration of the benefits from the\n          Article 6.4 mechanism as necessary in the decision to implement the activity are not\n          addressed in this standard. They are addressed in the “Standard: Article 6.4 activity\n          standard for projects”, the Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for programmes of\n          activities”, the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”, and the\n          “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for programmes of activities”.\n\n1.2.      Entry into force\n3.        The date of entry into force is the date of the publication of the SBM 015 meeting report\n          on 14 February 2025.\n\n2.        Definitions\n4.        The following definitions shall apply:\n          (a)    Activity participant: a public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4\n                 project;\n          (b)    Additionality: An Article 6.4 activity is additional if:\n                 (i)     It represents mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or\n                         regulation (see section 5.1 below).\n                 (ii)    It avoids locking in levels of emissions, technologies or carbon intensive\n                         practices that are incompatible with paragraph 33 of the rules, modalities and\n                         procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism for the mechanism (see section 6.2\n                         below); and\n                 (iii)   It would not have occurred in the absence of the incentives from the\n                         mechanism, taking into account all relevant national policies, including\n                         legislation (see section 6.3 below).\n          (c)    Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent\n                 agreements1, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding\n                 mandates.\n\n\n\n\n1    For example, agreements between parties, such as between a private sector entity and a government,\n     to take an action in exchange for avoiding court action.\n\n\n\n                                                   3 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n\n3.     Applicability\n5.     This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for\n       activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to\n       also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g. programmes\n       of activities, policies, sectoral approaches, etc).\n6.     The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions\n       and net removals.\n7.     The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For\n       simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard.\n\n4.     General principles and requirements\n4.1.   Principles\n8.     The following principles shall be applied in demonstrating additionality to ensure that\n       information provided is a true and fair account. These principles shall be the basis for and\n       guide the development of mechanism methodologies:\n       (a) Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for the demonstration\n           of additionality shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters that\n           may have an impact on the outcome of assessment of additionality shall be included;\n       (b) Completeness: All relevant information to support the assessment of additionality\n           shall be provided;\n       (c) Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across similar\n           circumstances;\n       (d) Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative information\n           shall be reduced as far as is practical;\n       (e) Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow\n           intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency relates\n           to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied; referencing\n           background material; stating documentation changes and stating and justifying all\n           data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the outcomes can be\n           reproduced;\n       (f) Conservativeness: In the context of demonstrating additionality, a methodological\n           approach is conservative if the data, parameters, assumptions and methods chosen\n           are more likely to lead to conservativeness.\n\n4.2.   General requirements\n9.     Mechanism methodologies shall specify the approach to demonstrating the additionality\n       of an Article 6.4 activity. The approach shall ensure that an Article 6.4 activity would not\n       be implemented without the incentives from the mechanism and that the incentives from\n       the mechanism enable the implementation of the activity.\n10.    Mechanism methodologies may either use separate approaches to demonstrate\n       additionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both\n\n\n\n                                               4 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n         demonstrates additionality and determine the baseline scenario. Where a combined\n         approach is used, both this standard and the standard “Setting the baseline in mechanism\n         methodologies” shall apply.\n11.      Mechanism methodologies shall ensure conservativeness in the demonstration of\n         additionality. This shall apply to all data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used in\n         the analysis (e.g. operating expenditure used in conducting an investment analysis or data\n         on the market penetration of a technology). The degree of conservativeness shall be\n         based on the level of uncertainty (e.g. in a sensitivity analysis of the investment analysis\n         the selection of the parameters to be varied and the magnitude of variation shall be\n         informed by uncertainty). All sources of uncertainty shall be considered, including\n         uncertainty in data, parameters, assumptions, and methods.\n12.      Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the provisions to demonstrate additionality\n         consider all national or sub-national policies that are applicable to the relevant Article 6.4\n         activity and its alternatives. This shall include legal requirements, subsidies, taxes, fees\n         and relevant other incentives. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national\n         targets for the sector or the type of activity, as long as these are supported by policy\n         frameworks for implementation, but not general goals that are not specific to the sector or\n         type of activity.\n13.      Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that additionality is demonstrated for an\n         Article 6.4 activity in its entirety (e.g. the capture of landfill gas combined with use of the\n         landfill gas for energy generation) and that additionality is not separately demonstrated for\n         different parts of an Article 6.4 activity (e.g. separately for the landfill gas capture and the\n         use of the landfill gas for energy generation). This provision does not apply if different\n         activities can be separately implemented at one site and do not affect each other (e.g. the\n         implementation of energy efficiency improvements and the catalytic abatement\n         of N2O emissions at a nitric acid production plant).\n\n5.       Approaches to demonstrate additionality\n5.1.     Overview of approaches to demonstrate additionality\n14.      This standard establishes requirements for the following approaches to demonstrate\n         additionality:\n      (a) Regulatory analysis: Regulatory analysis shall require demonstration that the proposed\n          activity represents mitigation that exceeds any mitigation that is required by law or\n          regulation unless the law or regulation refers to or formally integrates the mechanism as\n          an instrument for implementation. A law or regulation applicable to the proposed activity\n          that may require a certain technological, performance or management action shall be\n          considered, noting that regulatory environments vary;\n      (b) Analysis of lock-in risk: Demonstration that the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity\n          does not lead to locking in levels of emissions or carbon-intensive technologies or\n          practices that are incompatible with paragraph 33 of the rules, modalities and procedures\n          of the Article 6.4 mechanism;\n      (c) Investment analysis: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity is not financially viable in\n          the absence of revenues from A6.4ERs;\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n      (d) Barrier analysis: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity would be prevented by\n          barriers and that the incentives from the mechanism make the determining difference for\n          overcoming the barriers;\n      (e) Common practice analysis: Demonstration that the relevant technology or practice is\n          not common practice (e.g. it has a low market penetration);\n      (f) Performance-based approach: Demonstration that an Article 6.4 activity is unlikely to be\n          implemented without the incentives from the mechanism if it outperforms other activities\n          in one or several indicator(s) (e.g. an emissions benchmark) that are a good proxy for the\n          likelihood of additionality for the relevant technology or practice.\n\n5.2.     Possible combinations of approaches\n\n\n15.      Figure 1 illustrates how mechanism methodologies may combine the approaches referred\n         to in section 5.1 Other combinations of approaches are not permitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Flowchart of the approaches to demonstrate additionality\n\n\n\n\n16.    Regulatory analysis and analysis of lock-in risk shall be addressed in all mechanism\n       methodologies.\n17.    The investment analysis shall be used as the default approach. Where mechanism\n       methodologies do not apply the investment analysis, the methodology proponents shall\n       appropriately explain and justify why an investment analysis is infeasible or inappropriate.\n       In this case, the methodology proponents shall nevertheless include information on the\n       financial viability of eligible Article 6.4 activities or require activity participants to provide\n       such information.\n18.    The barrier analysis may be used as an alternative to the investment analysis, subject to\n       the applicability conditions in section 6.4.1 and appropriate justification.\n19.    Where investment analysis or barrier analysis are used, this shall be complemented by a\n       common practice analysis.\n20.    Performance-based approaches may be used as an alternative to the investment analysis,\n       barrier analysis and common practice analysis, subject to the applicability conditions in\n       section 6.6.1 and appropriate justification.\n\n\n\n\n                                                7 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n\n5.3.   Application of the approaches at different levels\n21.    The approaches for demonstration of additionality, as referred to in section 5.1, may be\n       applied at different levels and by different entities, subject to the provisions in paragraph\n       22:\n       (a)     Proponent of the mechanism methodology: The proponent of a mechanism\n               methodology may demonstrate that one or several of the approaches referred to\n               in section 5.1 are satisfied for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4 activities\n               that are eligible under the methodology. The methodology may specify applicability\n               criteria or conditions under which the approach is deemed to be satisfied for all, or\n               a subset of, the potential Article 6.4 activities (e.g. if activities are implemented in\n               a particular region and/or if the market penetration of the technology is below a\n               certain threshold in the relevant geographical region). The proponent of the\n               mechanism methodology shall provide documented evidence and justifications in\n               the methodology that the approach is satisfied for the relevant activities. The\n               mechanism methodology may then state that the approach is deemed to be\n               satisfied for the relevant activities, as long as the applicability criteria or conditions\n               specified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism methodology may need\n               to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis. The proponent of the\n               mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration of the validity of the\n               proposed methodology (e.g. three years);\n       (b)     Activity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify\n               in the methodology a methodological procedure for one or several of the\n               approaches referred to in section 5.1. This procedure shall then be applied by each\n               proposed Article 6.4 activity. For example, a methodology may prescribe an\n               investment comparison analysis that must be applied by activity participants to\n               assess the financial attractiveness of a proposed Article 6.4 activity;\n       (c)     Host countries: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify in the\n               methodology which approaches, parameters or conditions may or shall be\n               demonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host\n               countries..\n22.    The approaches for demonstration of additionality, as referred to in section 5.1, shall be\n       applied as follows:\n       (a)     Regulatory analysis shall be applied by activity participants, or by host countries\n               (through the submission of a standardized baseline).\n       (b)     Analysis of lock-in risk should preferably be applied by the proponent of the\n               mechanism methodology but may also be applied by activity participants, or by\n               host countries (through the submission of a standardized baseline);\n       (c)     Investment analysis and common practice analysis may be implemented at any of\n               the three levels referred to in paragraph 21;\n       (d)     Barrier analysis should preferably be applied by the proponent of the mechanism\n               methodology, or by the host countries (through the submission of a standardized\n               baseline). Where it is proposed to be applied by activity participants, appropriate\n               explanation and justification shall be provided why demonstration by the proponent\n               of the mechanism methodology, or by the host country (through the submission of\n               a standardized baseline) is not appropriate.\n\n\n\n                                                8 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n23.      Mechanism methodologies may apply different approaches for demonstrating additionality\n         at different levels. For example, a mechanism methodology could include a combination\n         of the following approaches: a regulatory analysis and an investment analysis to be\n         applied by the activity participants, combined with an analysis of lock-in risk and a common\n         practice analysis demonstrated by the proponent of the mechanism methodology.\n\n6.       Requirements for specific approaches\n6.1.     Regulatory analysis\n24.      Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to demonstrate that the emission\n         reductions or net removals resulting from an Article 6.4 activity would not occur as a result\n         of any law or regulation, unless the law or regulation refers to or formally integrates the\n         mechanism as an instrument for implementation. A law or regulation2 applicable to the\n         proposed activity that may require a certain technological, performance or management\n         action shall be considered, noting that regulatory environments vary.\n25.      The analysis supporting this demonstration shall confirm that legal requirements, except\n         for those that refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for\n         implementation, do not:\n         a) Directly require the implementation of an activity;\n         b) Indirectly require the implementation of an activity, by requiring a certain technological,\n            performance or management action or by preventing potential alternative scenarios to\n            the implementation of the activity;\n         c) Establish a support scheme that:\n                (i)    Is designed to achieve a quantitative target or outcome for the relevant\n                       technologies or practices;\n                (i)    Is applicable to the activity; and\n                (ii)   Would likely result in the same amount of emission reductions or net\n                       removals if the activity would not be implemented.\n26.      The analysis shall be based on credible and current evidence and be justified.\n27.      The mechanism methodology shall specify the appropriate frequency for updating the\n         analysis, taking into account the context of the type of activity, as follows:\n         (a)    Where the analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in paragraph\n                21(b), the analysis shall be conducted at the latest at each renewal of the crediting\n                period;\n         (b)    Where the analysis is applied through a standardized baseline, as referred to in\n                21(c), the mechanism methodology shall specify for how long the standardized\n                baseline may be valid (i.e. by when the standardized baseline would need to be\n                updated to confirm that the conclusion of the analysis is still valid).\n\n\n\n\n2    A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 75.\n\n\n\n                                                 9 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n\n6.2.   Analysis of lock-in risk\n28.    Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the analysis of lock-in risk follows a neutral\n       approach with regards to technology and source.\n29.    Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that an Article 6.4 activity:\n       (a)     Does not lead to the adoption or the prolongation of the lifetime of technologies or\n               practices that are incompatible with long term goals of the Paris Agreement, taking\n               into account different national circumstances, approaches and pathways;\n       (b)     Is consistent with the host country’s long-term low-emission development strategy\n               (LT-LEDS), as referred to in Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement (where the host\n               country has submitted one);\n       (c)     For technologies or practices with a long lifetime, relies on a technology or practice\n               that is among those within the lowest greenhouse gas intensity in the relevant\n               region taking into account the lifetime of the technology or practice in line with\n               national circumstances, approaches and pathways; and\n       (d)     Does not involve a technology or practice that constitutes an inefficient use of a\n               resource that is important for mitigating climate change or achieving other policy\n               objectives.\n30.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall either provide appropriate justification\n       that all Article 6.4 activities eligible under the mechanism methodology meet the above\n       requirements, as per paragraph 29(a), or include a methodological procedure that activity\n       participants or host countries shall apply to demonstrate the above requirements, as\n       referred to in paragraphs 29(b) and 29(c).\n31.    The analysis shall consider socio-economic contexts, existing infrastructure and any path\n       dependencies. The analysis shall also consider:\n       (a)     The technical or operational lifetime of the technologies or practices established\n               as part of an Article 6.4 activity;\n       (b)     The emissions intensity of these technologies and practices;\n       (c)     The scale of the Article 6.4 activity and\n       (d)     Availability and feasibility of alternative options given national circumstances.\n32.    Where the technologies or practices applicable under the mechanism methodologies have\n       a technical or operational lifetime of no more than 10 years, a mechanism methodology\n       may assume that no lock-in risk exists. Appropriate evidence and justification shall be\n       provided for the estimation of the technical or operational lifetime of the technology or\n       practice. Where this option is used, the validity of the methodology shall be limited to 31\n       December 2030 and the methodology shall be reviewed by the Supervisory Body prior to\n       its expiry.\n\n\n\n\n                                              10 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n33.    The analysis shall be implemented in a conservative manner and be appropriately justified.\n\n6.3.   Investment analysis\n\n6.3.1. Type of analyses\n34.    The following types of investment analyses may be used:\n       (a)     Simple cost analysis: Demonstration that the implementation of an Article 6.4\n               activity is associated with costs and does not generate any cost savings or\n               revenues other than from A6.4ERs;\n       (b)     Benchmark analysis: Comparison of the financial attractiveness of an Article 6.4\n               activity with a financial benchmark; or\n       (c)     Investment comparison analysis: Comparison of the financial attractiveness of an\n               Article 6.4 activity with alternative options.\n35.    The type of analysis applied shall be suitable for the context of the type of Article 6.4\n       activities that are eligible under the methodology. For example, where the type of activity\n       can only be implemented by the activity participants and the activity participants face\n       different alternative investment options, the investment comparison analysis is most\n       suitable. The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify the choice of analysis.\n36.    Where the analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in paragraph 21(b),\n       the mechanism methodology shall specify which of the analysis referred to in paragraph\n       34 shall be used by the activity participants. The mechanism methodology shall set out a\n       detailed procedure on how the analysis shall be conducted.\n\n6.3.2. General requirements for conducting the investment analysis\n37.    The analysis shall include all relevant costs, including capital expenditure (CAPEX) and\n       operational expenditure (OPEX), including any barriers that can be monetized and\n       quantified as an additional cost, and all revenues and cost savings, including any public\n       funding such as subsidies, where applicable.\n38.    All parameters and assumptions used in the analysis shall be internally consistent. For\n       example, cash flows shall be expressed in either real or nominal terms consistently and\n       be determined consistent with the financial indicator used. The assumptions, data and\n       conclusions in the investment analysis shall be transparently documented, appropriately\n       justified and substantiated by evidence.\n39.    The analysis shall be implemented in a conservative manner. To ensure\n       conservativeness, the analysis shall include a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that the\n       conclusion of the analysis is robust to reasonable variations in the critical parameters and\n       assumptions, including CAPEX, OPEX, revenues and cost savings, as applicable.\n40.    The analysis of the financial viability of Article 6.4 activities without revenues from\n       A6.4ERs shall not include any transaction costs associated with generating A6.4ERs (e.g.\n       costs for preparing the PDD, validation and verification, fees to be paid to the UNFCCC).\n41.    Where the analysis is applied by the proponent of a mechanism methodology, or by the\n       host country (through the submission of a standardized baseline), as referred to in\n       paragraph 21(c) above, the analysis shall demonstrate that it is very likely that Article 6.4\n       activities that are eligible under the methodology satisfy the investment analysis. The\n\n\n\n                                              11 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n       analysis shall be based on data and information that is representative for the Article 6.4\n       activities that are eligible under the methodology, reflecting any important variations\n       among activities, such as the geographical region, the size of activities, or variations in the\n       technology or practice. The analysis may be supported by information from the literature\n       or data from a sample of activities. The analysis shall be publicly disclosed with the\n       proposed mechanism methodology.\n42.    Where the analysis is applied by the activity participants, as referred to in paragraph 21(b)\n       above, the following applies:\n       (a)     The analysis shall be based on data and information applicable to the proposed\n               Article 6.4 activity, except otherwise specified in this standard;\n       (b)     The analysis shall be based on data and information that is consistent with\n               information presented to the entity’s decision-making management and\n               investors/lenders at the start date of the Article 6.4 activity, as defined in the\n               “Standard: Article 6.4 activity standard for projects”. Where the project design\n               document (PDD) is submitted for validation prior to the start date of the Article 6.4\n               activity, the analysis shall be updated through the submission of a request for\n               approval of post-registration changes in accordance with the procedure “Article 6.4\n               activity cycle procedure for projects” (A6.4-PROC-AC-002) or as part of at the first\n               verification of emission reductions or net removals, based on data and information\n               that was available at the start date;\n       (c)     Where public funding for an Article 6.4 activity, expressed in grant equivalents, is\n               larger than the expected revenues from A6.4ERs, mechanism methodologies shall\n               require demonstration that public funding would not have filled the funding gap in\n               the absence of revenues from A6.4ERs. This may, for example, apply to public\n               funding schemes that are designed to pay for the funding gap of mitigation\n               activities;\n       (d)     For transparency purposes, activity participants may specify the abatement costs\n               as part of the PDD or monitoring reports.\n\n6.3.3. Requirements applicable to simple cost analysis\n43.    The simple cost analysis shall demonstrate that the implementation of an Article 6.4\n       activity is associated with costs and does not generate any cost savings or revenues other\n       than from A6.4ERs.\n\n6.3.4. Requirements applicable to benchmark analysis and investment comparison\n       analysis\n44.    A suitable financial indicator for the financial viability of an Article 6.4 activity shall be used,\n       such as the net present value or internal rate of return.\n45.    The period of assessment shall reflect the period of expected operation of the underlying\n       technology or practice and include the residual value of the assets at the end of the\n       assessment period. Other periods and approaches may be proposed by proponents of\n       mechanism methodologies with appropriate justification.\n\n6.3.5. Requirements applicable to benchmark analysis\n46.    The financial benchmark shall be derived in a conservative manner.\n\n\n\n                                                12 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n47.    Where the benchmark analysis is applied by the proponent of the mechanism\n       methodology, or a host country (through the submission of a standardized baseline), as\n       referred to in paragraphs 21(c) above, the financial benchmark shall be consistent with\n       the weighted average cost of capital (or the cost of equity, as applicable) that is commonly\n       applicable to the country, sector and type of activity.\n48.    Where the benchmark analysis is applied by activity participants, as referred to in 21(b),\n       the following applies:\n       (a)     Where the Article 6.4 activity can only be implemented by the activity participants,\n               and not by any other entities, the financial benchmark shall be based on the\n               benchmark used by the entity implementing the Article 6.4 activity. This may apply,\n               for example, to modifications to an existing plant;\n       (b)     Where the Article 6.4 activity could also be implemented by other entities, the\n               financial benchmark shall be based on the more conservative value between (i)\n               the benchmark used by the entity implementing the Article 6.4 activity and (ii) the\n               weighted average cost of capital (or the cost of equity, as applicable) that is\n               commonly applicable to the country, sector and type of activity. This may apply, for\n               example, to the installation of greenfield plants.\n49.    An Article 6.4 activity shall only be considered additional if the analysis demonstrates that\n       the Article 6.4 activity would not be financially viable, based on credible data and input\n       parameters to the investment analysis.\n\n6.3.6. Requirements applicable to investment comparison analysis\n50.    In most sectors, the alternative scenarios considered shall provide the same type and level\n       of products or service as the Article 6.4 activity. This requirement does not apply to some\n       land-use activities, such as afforestation or avoided deforestation, where there could be a\n       change in the type of service between the scenario with the Article 6.4 activity and the\n       baselines scenario.\n51.    An Article 6.4 activity shall only be considered additional if the analysis demonstrates that\n       the activity would not be financially viable, based on credible data parameters to the\n       investment analysis.\n\n6.4.   Barrier analysis\n\n6.4.1. Applicability\n52.    The barrier analysis may be applied for Article 6.4 activities that are:\n       (a)     Implemented at individual households (e.g. distribution of efficient cookstoves); or\n       (b)     Undertaken by small public or private entities that typically do not have access to\n               commercial or public third-party finance .\n53.    Other cases for the application of the barrier analysis may be proposed by mechanism\n       methodology proponents with due justification and demonstration that such barriers are\n       prohibitive, including examples of relevant barriers.\n\n6.4.2. Requirements for conducting the barrier analysis\n54.    The following barriers may be considered:\n\n\n\n                                              13 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n       (a)     Institutional barriers (e.g. the investor not being the beneficiary of cost savings\n               associated with the investment);\n       (b)     Information barriers;\n       (c)     Financial barriers (e.g. lack of access to loans by rural households);\n       (d)     The activity is first-of-its kind (e.g. no other similar activities have been\n               implemented in the relevant geographical area).\n55.    Investment barriers (e.g. high interest rates for loans due to high perceived country risks)\n       and other relevant barriers shall be considered as part of an investment analysis.\n56.    The barrier analysis shall:\n       (a)     Identify and describe relevant barriers faced by the Article 6.4 activity;\n       (b)     Demonstrate that the barriers prevent the Article 6.4 activity from being\n               implemented without the incentives from the mechanism;\n       (c)     Demonstrate that there are no other programs or incentives, such as subsidies,\n               that would incentivize the Article 6.4 activity;\n       (d)     Demonstrate that the incentives from the mechanism are the determinant element\n               in overcoming the identified barriers;\n       (e)     Demonstrate that at least one plausible alternative to the Article 6.4 activity does\n               not face significant barriers, including the barrier faced by the Article 6.4 activity.\n57.    The barrier analysis shall take into account:\n       (a)     All relevant national and sub-national policies, including legislation;\n       (b)     Current practices within the sector and geographic area;\n       (c)     Indigenous Traditional Knowledge and customary laws, where applicable and\n       (d)     Relevant national circumstances, approaches and pathways.\n58.    Barriers that are unique to a proposed Article 6.4 activity may only be used if the activity\n       can only be implemented by the activity participants.\n59.    The barrier analysis shall be supported by credible evidence. Such evidence may include\n       independent studies, publicly available surveys, relevant verifiable market data, or data\n       from national or international statistics but shall not include anecdotal evidence. The\n       evidence shall be interpreted in a conservative manner (i.e. that it is unlikely that the effect\n       of the barrier is overestimated).\n\n6.5.   Common practice analysis\n60.    Mechanism methodologies that use a common practice analysis shall include provisions\n       to demonstrate that Article 6.4 activities are not common practice. This shall include:\n       (a)     An appropriate definition of a suitable indicator to assess common practice based\n               on the recent uptake or existing stock or diffusion of technologies, services or\n               practices in relation to a realistic maximum market size or potential, taking into\n\n\n\n\n                                               14 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n               account any constraints for the uptake of the relevant technology, service, or\n               practice;\n       (b)     A definition of the appropriate geographical boundary for assessing common\n               practice for the type of technology, service or practice, taking into account relevant\n               market boundaries, where applicable; and\n       (c)     The specification of an appropriately conservative threshold that may not be\n               surpassed for an Article 6.4 activity to be deemed additional.\n\n6.6.   Performance-based approaches\n\n6.6.1. Applicability\n61.    A performance-based approach may be applied to types of Article 6.4 activities where all\n       of the following conditions are met:\n       (a)     The mechanism methodology uses the baseline approach(es) referred to\n               paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) of the rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4\n               mechanism;\n       (b)     The type of activity involves the production of a highly homogeneous product or\n               the provision of a highly standardized service (e.g. electricity);\n       (c)     The performance of the type of activity can be defined through one or several\n               suitable indicator(s);\n       (d)     Information is available to demonstrate that activities with a better performance in\n               respect to the indicator(s) have a higher likelihood of additionality;\n       (e)     Data is available or can be collected on the performance of activities with respect\n               to the indicator(s), and the data is robust and representative.\n62.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall demonstrate and justify that these\n       conditions are fulfilled.\n\n6.6.2. Requirements for conducting performance-based approaches\n63.    Mechanism methodologies shall define one or several suitable indicators and thresholds\n       for the performance-based approach and specify the approach to the use or collection of\n       data.\n\n6.6.2.1.       Establishment of indicator(s)\n64.    The indicator(s) shall be a good proxy for the likelihood for additionality. This means that\n       activities with a better performance in respect to the indicator(s) shall have a demonstrably\n       higher likelihood of additionality. Indicator(s) may be based on different metrics such as\n       greenhouse gas emissions intensity, market penetration or other unique characteristics of\n       the type of activity.\n65.    Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and\n       appropriateness of the proposed indicator(s) for the context of the type of activity and\n       geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable. Where possible, the\n       correlation between the indicator(s) and the likelihood of additionality should be quantified.\n\n\n\n\n                                              15 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n6.6.2.2.       Establishment of threshold(s)\n66.    The threshold(s) shall be defined such that an Article 6.4 activity is only deemed additional\n       if the indicator(s) pass the threshold(s) (passing may mean being above or below the\n       threshold, depending on the type of indicator).\n67.    The threshold(s) shall be set ambitiously, by:\n       (a)     Ensuring that an Article 6.4 activity is very likely (i.e. at least 90% probability) to be\n               additional; and\n       (b)     Setting the threshold(s) at least at the level referred to in paragraph 36 (ii) of the\n               rules, modalities and procedures of the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n68.    It shall be very unlikely (i.e. less than 10% probability) that the threshold(s) are exceeded\n       by an Article 6.4 activity due to other influencing factors that are unrelated to the Article 6.4\n       activity (e.g. interannual variations in climatic conditions).\n69.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify the duration of the validity of any threshold(s)\n       provided in the methodology (e.g. three years) and how threshold(s) will be updated.\n70.    Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and\n       appropriateness of the proposed threshold(s) for the context of the type of activity and\n       geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable.\n\n6.6.2.3.       Use and collection of data\n71.    The mechanism methodology shall specify the approach to data collection, or which\n       existing data shall be used. The data used by the mechanism methodology shall be:\n       (a)     Representative, reliable, accurate, consistent and transparent;\n       (b)     Recent, especially in dynamic technological environments;\n       (c)     Sufficiently disaggregated, taking into account differences in relevant technologies,\n               geographical or climate conditions, and the political, economic and social\n               environment; and\n       (d)     Verifiable.\n72.    Uncertainty in the outcome shall be quantified and addressed through conservative\n       approaches (e.g. uncertainty reductions). Where sampling is involved, the sampling\n       approach and any statistical analyses shall be described.\n73.    Proponents of mechanism methodologies shall demonstrate and justify the suitability and\n       appropriateness of the approach towards using or collecting data in the context of the type\n       of activity and geographical areas to which the methodology is applicable.\n\n6.6.2.4.       Use of threshold(s) for determining baseline emissions\n74.    Where a threshold is defined as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of output, it may also\n       be used for determining baseline emissions, as long as the requirements in the “Standard\n       for baseline setting” are fulfilled.\n\n                                                -----\n\n\n\n\n                                               16 of 17\nA6.4-STAN-METH-003\nStandard: Demonstration of additionality in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.2\n\n\n\n                                     Document information\n\n Version     Date                   Description\n\n\n 01.2        5 March 2025           Editorial correction to paragraph 14 (c).\n 01.1        26 February 2025       Editorial revision to remove technology specific examples and\n                                    correct cross referencing.\n 01.0        14 February 2025       SBM 015, Annex 11\n                                    Initial adoption.\n\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Standard\n Business Function: Methodology\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, additionality, methodologies\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17 of 17\n"

Introduction\n1.1.   Scope\n1.     This standard sets out requirements for mechanism methodologies for setting the crediting\n       baseline, including identifying the baseline scenario and determining baseline emissions\n       and/or removals, and provides requirements for the determination of standardized\n       baselines. It will be applied by proponents of mechanism methodologies in developing\n       methodologies and by the Secretariat, the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) and the\n       Supervisory Body in assessing and considering mechanism methodologies for approval.\n       The standard is not intended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or\n       monitoring reports.\n2.     Additional requirements for mechanism methodologies beyond setting the baseline are\n       included in Appendix 1 to this document.\n\n1.2.   Entry into force\n3.

It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an\n                 emissions or removals intensity;\n         (g)     Crediting baseline: Reference emissions or removals level against which the\n                 volume of emission reductions or net removals achieved by the Article 6.4 activity\n                 is quantified;\n         (h)     Legal requirements: Laws, statutes, regulations, court orders, decrees, consent\n                 agreements, executive orders, permitting conditions or any other legally binding\n                 mandates, noting that regulatory environments may vary;\n         (i)     Level of aggregation: The extent to which consolidation of information from any\n                 parts or units to form a collective whole is undertaken;\n         (j)     Level of service: the quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an\n                 Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;\n         (k)     Output: Each good or service1 provided by the Article 6.4 activity and/or in the\n                 baseline scenario, as specified in the mechanism methodology;\n         (l)     Policies: All national or sub-national policies that are applicable to the relevant\n                 activity and its alternatives, including: policies and legal requirements; subsidies\n                 and incentives (e.g., incentives from carbon pricing schemes such as emission\n                 trading schemes or from guarantees of origin); taxes and tax breaks; fees;\n                 performance standards; or other specified instruments or means of\n                 implementation. This shall also include any specific national or sub-national targets\n                 for the sector or the type of activity, as long as these are supported by policy\n                 frameworks for implementation, but not general goals (e.g., a national emissions\n                 target) that are not specific to the sector or type of activity;\n         (m)     Pool of users: For activities related to outputs, the pool of users consists of the\n                 user(s) supplied with the outputs by the activity;\n         (n)     Remaining lifetime: The period during which an equipment would continue\n                 operating and/or a certain practice would remain in place without undergoing major\n                 repair or overhaul as specified in the mechanism methodology, given limitations\n                 such as technical lifetime, economic lifetime, legal requirements, policies, or any\n                 other factor which would lead to the discontinuation of the use of the equipment\n                 and/or practice;\n         (o)     Sector: A segment of a national economy that delivers defined output(s) (e.g.\n                 municipal waste management, household cooking energy, electricity, residential\n                 cooling, freight transportation);\n\n\n\n1   For example, electricity, cooking energy, municipal waste management, and so forth.\n\n\n\n                                                 5 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n          (p)     Standardized baseline: A standardization developed on a subnational, national,\n                  or group-of-Parties basis rather than on activity-specific basis to facilitate the\n                  determination of the baseline, calculation of GHG emission reductions or removals\n                  and/or the determination of additionality for Article 6.4 activities, while ensuring\n                  environmental integrity within the scope of the standardized baseline.2\n\n3.        Applicability\n5.        This version of the standard is applicable to proposed mechanism methodologies for\n          activities undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to\n          also cover methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes\n          of activities, policies, sectoral approaches, etc). The standard further applies for the\n          development of standardized baselines.\n6.        The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions\n          and net removals. The standard may be amended in the future to incorporate further\n          considerations for activities involving removals.\n7.        The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For\n          simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard.\n\n4.        General principles and requirements\n4.1.      Principles\n8.        The following principles shall be applied in setting crediting baselines and standardized\n          baselines to ensure that information provided is a true and fair account. These principles\n          shall be the basis for and guide the development of mechanism methodologies and\n          standardized baselines:\n          (a)     Accuracy: Bias and uncertainties in both quantitative and non-quantitative\n                  information shall be reduced as far as is practical;\n          (b)     Below business as usual: The determined crediting baseline shall be below a\n                  conservatively determined BAU emissions level;\n          (c)     Completeness: All relevant information to support the baseline setting shall be\n                  included;\n          (d)     Conservativeness: In the context of baseline setting, conservativeness is the use\n                  of data, parameters, assumptions, and methods to ensure that baseline emissions\n                  are not overestimated, and baseline removals are not underestimated. Only\n                  credible sources shall be used that are appropriate to the context of the type of\n                  activity;\n          (e)     Consistency: The application of methods ensures consistent results across\n                  similar circumstances;\n\n\n\n\n2    Based on the definition provided in A6.4-STAN-METH-001, para. 63. Available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n       (f)     Encourage ambition over time: Crediting baselines shall decrease over time to\n               encourage ambition of activities;\n       (g)     Real: The results of activities represent actual tonnes of GHG emission reductions\n               or net removals derived from credible methods for estimating mitigation outcomes;\n       (h)     Relevance: Data, parameters, assumptions, and methods used for setting the\n               crediting baseline shall not be misleading and only verifiable data and parameters\n               that may have an impact on the outcome of setting the crediting baseline shall be\n               included;\n       (i)     Transparency: Sufficient and appropriate information shall be disclosed to allow\n               intended users to make decisions with reasonable confidence. Transparency\n               relates to clearly stating all data, parameters, assumptions and methods applied;\n               referencing background material; stating documentation changes and stating and\n               justifying all data, parameters, methods and assumptions made such that the\n               outcomes can be reproduced.\n\n4.2.   General requirements\n\n4.2.1. General requirements for quantification\n9.     Mechanism methodologies shall satisfy the general requirements for mechanism\n       methodologies included in Appendix 1 of this standard.\n\n4.2.2. Description of the pre-activity scenario\n10.    Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to describe the pre-activity\n       scenario in the PDD. The pre-activity scenario corresponds to the circumstances\n       immediately prior to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and shall be the existing\n       conditions at the site where the activity will be implemented; or the conditions in the\n       absence of policies that refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for\n       implementation or, for the case of distributed technologies for households, communities,\n       and/or small and medium enterprises, the existing conditions for providing the activity\n       output(s) in the baseline geographical reference area.\n\n4.2.3. Data requirements for baseline setting and quantification\n11.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify the assumptions, parameters, data sources and\n       key factors used for determining the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline emissions\n       and/or removals and specify the related requirements with regard to data quality, vintage,\n       availability and credibility.\n12.    Mechanism methodologies shall require data to be sourced from the most appropriate\n       data source. This may include internal data of the activity participants or publicly available\n       information provided by third parties. Only credible sources shall be used that are\n       appropriate to the context of the type of activity. Relevant third-party data sources may\n       include IPCC publications, peer-reviewed scientific literature, test results following\n       accepted standards performed by accredited entities, reports/statistics published by\n       governments, multilateral entities, or industry or sector organizations, as applicable.\n13.    Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants and developers of\n       standardized baselines to transparently list and describe the sources of data considered\n\n\n\n                                              7 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n       and justify the vintage, relevance, accuracy, and conservativeness of the choices made.\n       The data used shall be referenced. In cases where values, approaches or data sources\n       are only applicable to specific scopes (e.g., geographic or sectoral scopes), the\n       mechanism methodologies or standardized baselines shall clearly describe the scope of\n       applicability of the respective values, approaches or data sources.\n14.    Mechanism methodologies shall determine the baseline scenario and the baseline\n       emissions and/or removals in a transparent manner. They shall also take into account the\n       uncertainty associated with setting the baseline scenario and quantifying baseline\n       emissions and/or removals, consistent with relevant IPCC guidelines. The consideration\n       of uncertainty shall include all causes of uncertainty, including assumptions, equations or\n       models, parameters and measurements. The consideration of uncertainty may, however,\n       focus or be limited to those causes of uncertainty that are most relevant in the context of\n       the Article 6.4 activity (e.g., the uncertainty of minor baseline emission sources may not\n       need to be considered). In the process of quantification of uncertainties, expert judgment\n       may be used, among other approaches provided by relevant IPCC guidelines.\n15.    Different approaches may be pursued to address uncertainty. These may include\n       approaches that address overall uncertainty or approaches that address uncertainty\n       separately for the baseline scenario and the quantification of baseline emissions and/or\n       removals. For example, in the case of uncertainties in the selection of the baseline\n       scenario, the most conservative scenario may be selected among different plausible\n       scenarios; whereas, for determining the baseline emissions and/or removals the\n       uncertainty may be quantified using approaches such as formulas for error propagation.\n\n4.2.4. Standardization\n16.    Standardization of baseline scenarios and crediting baselines in mechanism\n       methodologies is encouraged as this avoids the risk of selection bias in using project-\n       specific approaches, which could lead to overestimation of baseline emissions or\n       underestimation of baseline removals. Such standardization may be achieved by the\n       application of the BAT or ambitious benchmark approach to baseline setting or through\n       the use of default values.\n\n4.2.5. Justification of methodological choices and assumptions\n17.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall justify all methodological choices and\n       assumptions made in determining the baseline scenario and the crediting baseline,\n       including how the choices and assumptions ensure that the principles and requirements\n       in this section and the requirements in Appendix 1 are satisfied.\n\n5.     Approach to setting the crediting baseline\n5.1.   Summary of the step-wise approach to determining the crediting baseline\n18.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify the procedure for determining the crediting\n       baseline, in accordance with the step-wise approach in figure 1 and described below.\n\n\n\n\n                                              8 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Apply the downward adjustment, unless exemptions apply\n                (Section 7), including\n       •    Quantification of the downward adjustment\n       •    Quantification of the resulting downward adjusted baseline emissions and/or\n            removals\n\n\n\n\n    Step 4.   Identify a conservative BAU baseline (Section 8), including\n       • Determination of the BAU scenario\n       • Quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals\n\n\n\n\n    Step 5.       Compare the downward adjusted baseline from Step 3 and the\n                  conservative BAU baseline from Step 4 (Section 9)\n       •    Is the numerical value of the downward adjusted baseline lower than the\n            numerical value of the conservative BAU baseline?\n\n\n\n\n    Select the downward adjusted baseline                Apply a further adjustment to ensure\n    as the crediting baseline                            that the downward adjusted baseline\n                                                         is lower than the conservative BAU\n                                                         baseline\n\n\n\n\n3   Note that this procedure is applied both ex-ante in the project design document and ex-post in monitoring\n    reports. Further details on the timing and the ex-post application is included in sections 8 to 9. For ex-\n    post application of the procedure, in Step 5, the lower between the conservative BAU and the downward\n    adjusted baseline is selected as the crediting baseline for each calendar year during the crediting period,\n    rather than going back to Step 3.\n\n\n\n                                                    9 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1. Step 1: Selection of one of the baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of the Rules,\n       Modalities and Procedures\n19.      In Step 1, mechanism methodologies shall specify which of the approaches from\n         paragraph 36 of the Rules, Modalities and Procedures (RMPs) is selected for determining\n         the crediting baseline for the Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies shall apply\n         one of the three approaches specified in paragraph 36 of the RMPs for setting the baseline\n         scenario for each of the components of the activity (e.g., for the capture of landfill gas and\n         its use for energy generation, one baseline approach may be applied for the capture of\n         landfill gas and a different baseline approach may be applied for energy generation). The\n         selected approach shall satisfy the applicability conditions provided for the relevant\n         approach in section 6 below. The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall also\n         consider the guidance provided in section 6 on which approaches may be best suited\n         under different circumstances and justify the appropriateness of the choice among\n         approaches (i) to (iii) of paragraph 36 of the RMP.\n\n5.1.2. Step 2: Application of the selected baseline approach prior to downward adjustment\n20.      In step 2, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the selected approach, prior to any\n         downward adjustment, is applied to determine the baseline scenario and the baselines\n         emissions and/or removals occurring in the determined baseline scenario.\n21.      Mechanism methodologies shall define and justify, or require the activity participants to\n         define and justify, the baseline geographical reference area considering the main baseline\n         sources or sinks. The baseline geographical reference area may be global, regional,\n         national, sub-national or site-specific. An Article 6.4 activity type that supplies a global pool\n         of users with a highly internationally traded good (e.g., aluminium) may need to consider\n         global conditions when setting the crediting baseline. On the contrary, some Article 6.4\n         activity types may only affect baseline emissions within a very restricted geographical\n         scope or even at a specific site4.\n22.      To determine the baseline scenario, the mechanism methodology shall either:\n         (a)     Specify and justify the baseline scenario; or\n         (b)     Include a stepwise procedure for how activity participants or host countries shall\n                 determine the baseline scenario.\n23.      The procedure and methodological approaches for paragraph 22 shall follow the\n         requirements set out in section 6 of this standard.\n24.      Mechanism methodologies may either use separate approaches to demonstrate\n         additionality and determine the baseline scenario or use a combined approach that both\n         demonstrates additionality and determines the baseline scenario, depending on the\n         approach selected. Specifically, it may be possible to use BAT or an ambitious benchmark\n         to simultaneously determine the baseline scenario and apply “performance-based\n         approaches” in demonstrating additionality (refer to the “Standard: Demonstration of\n         additionality in mechanism methodologies”). Where a combined approach is used, both\n\n\n\n4   For example, in the case of switching to a low-emission energy source or feedstock in a specific plant,\n    only site-specific conditions may need to be considered when setting the crediting baseline.\n\n\n\n                                                  10 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n       this standard and the standard “Demonstration of additionality in mechanism\n       methodologies” shall apply.\n25.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify the methods for quantification of the baseline\n       emissions and/or removals. Mechanism methodologies shall specify to which potential\n       baseline scenarios its quantification methods are applicable. The methodological\n       approaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 6 of this standard.\n26.    Under all three approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs, mechanism methodologies shall\n       determine whether any trends in the emissions and removals, or the emissions or\n       removals intensity (i.e., emissions or removals per unit of output), over time should be\n       incorporated in the baseline quantification. Such trends may, inter alia, arise from\n       technological improvements over time or occur due to policies. This is necessary if such\n       trends have a material impact on the emissions and removals, or the emissions or removal\n       intensity, in the baseline scenario. Where such trends are relevant, mechanism\n       methodologies may reflect such trends by determining a baseline that declines over time\n       or by setting the baseline at a sufficiently ambitious level to address any such trends.\n\n5.1.3. Step 3: Application of the downward adjustment\n27.    In step 3, mechanism methodologies shall specify how the downward adjustment shall be\n       determined, including the quantification of the downward adjustment and the quantification\n       of the resulting downward adjusted baseline.\n28.    Where baseline approaches from RMP paragraph 36 (i) or (ii) have been selected,\n       exemptions from the downward adjustment may apply in particular circumstances, subject\n       to the provisions in section 7.2. Where such exemptions are proposed, the proponent of\n       the mechanism methodology shall provide appropriate justification.\n29.    The procedure and methodological approaches to determine the downward adjustment\n       shall follow the requirements set out in section 7.\n30.    The downward adjusted baseline shall be determined as the baseline emissions and/or\n       removals determined in Step 2, reduced by the quantified downward adjustment\n       determined in accordance with the requirements in section 7. Note that for both emissions\n       and removals baselines, the downward adjustment is subtracted, noting that removals\n       shall be assigned a negative value and emissions a positive value.\n\n5.1.4. Step 4: Identification of a conservative business-as-usual baseline\n31.    In step 4, mechanism methodologies shall specify how a conservative business-as-usual\n       (BAU) baseline shall be determined, including the determination of the BAU scenario and\n       the quantification of the emissions and/or removals occurring in the BAU scenario. The\n       methodological approaches shall follow the requirements set out in section 8.\n\n5.1.5. Step 5: Comparison of the downward adjusted baseline and the conservative\n       business-as-usual baseline\n32.    In Step 5, mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to compare the\n       downward adjusted baseline and the conservative BAU baseline and specify the\n       procedure and methodological approaches to select the crediting baseline following the\n       requirements set out in section 9.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n5.2.   Application of the baseline approaches at different levels of aggregation\n33.    The baseline scenario or parameters to quantify crediting baseline for emissions and/or\n       removals, such as baseline emission factors, may be applied at different levels and by\n       different entities:\n       (a)     Proponent of the mechanism methodology: The proponent of a mechanism\n               methodology may determine the baseline scenario or parameters to quantify\n               baseline emissions and/or removals, for all, or a subset of, the potential Article 6.4\n               activities that are eligible under the methodology. For example, a mechanism\n               methodology may determine the baseline scenario as the consumption of power\n               from the electric grid and may accordingly provide methods to determine the grid\n               emission factor to quantify baseline emissions. The proponent of the mechanism\n               methodology shall provide documented evidence and justifications in the\n               methodology that the scenario and/or parameters are applicable for the relevant\n               activities. The mechanism methodology may then state that these matters are\n               deemed to be applicable for the relevant activities, as long as the applicability\n               criteria or conditions specified in the methodology are satisfied. The mechanism\n               methodology may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis.\n               The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration\n               of the validity of the proposed methodology (e.g., three years). Where the\n               application of the standardization is mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the\n               mechanism methodology;\n       (b)     Activity participants: The proponent of a mechanism methodology may specify\n               in the methodology how the baseline scenario shall be determined and/or how\n               baseline emissions and/or removals shall be quantified by each individual activity\n               applying the methodology. This procedure shall then be applied by each proposed\n               Article 6.4 activity. For example, a methodology may provide a method for how\n               each activity shall quantify existing actual or historical emissions and a downward\n               adjustment factor for them;\n       (c)     Host countries: The proponents of a mechanism methodology shall specify in the\n               methodology which approaches, parameters or conditions may or shall be\n               demonstrated through the submission of a proposed standardized baseline by host\n               countries. This may include standardization in relation to baseline setting, baseline\n               quantification, or additionality demonstration. Standardization could also relate\n               only to a specific parameter, such as the grid emission factor or the fraction of non-\n               renewable biomass. Where the application of the standardized baseline is\n               mandatory, this shall be explicitly stated in the standardized baseline.\n\n6.     Application of baseline approaches from paragraph 36 of\n       the Rules, Modalities and Procedures\n34.    This section sets out how the approaches for setting the baseline referred to in paragraph\n       36 of the RMP shall be implemented in mechanism methodologies. The section\n       complements the requirements set out in Step 2 of section 5.\n\n\n\n\n                                              12 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n6.1.   Best available technology approach\n\n6.1.1. Applicability\n35.    Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where the\n       following applies:\n       (a)     The emissions or removals per unit of output are determined primarily by the\n               technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity; and\n       (b)     Best available technology (BAT) can be determined with the available data.\n36.    This approach may be particularly suitable where:\n       (a)     An activity consists of a single technology and/or practice (e.g.,\n               substitution/installation of new equipment such as clean cooking activities);\n               and/or\n       (b)     The activity and alternative technologies and/or practices provide reasonably\n               homogeneous outputs (i.e., they produce similar outputs for the pool of users).\n37.    If the proposed mechanism methodology falls within the scope of the sector or activity type\n       identified by the host party to apply BAT as default approach, then only BAT is applicable.\n\n6.1.2. Level of aggregation at which best available technology is determined\n38.    Mechanism methodologies shall determine, or provide a procedure for activity participants\n       to determine, the applicability of the BAT baseline, including:\n       (a)     Geographic scope;\n       (b)     Technologies and/or practices for which it is applicable; and\n       (c)     Validity over time.\n39.    The BAT approach may be applied at different levels and by different entities in line with\n       the description in Section 5.2 above, including by the proponent of the mechanism\n       methodology, the activity participant, or by host Parties. Next to such bottom-up\n       approaches, the Supervisory Body may determine a BAT baseline following a top-down\n       process. BATs determined by these entities shall have the following geographic scopes:\n       (a)     Supervisory Body: global, or a narrower scope set during the determination of the\n               BAT;\n       (b)     Host Party: the national boundaries of the Party, or a sub-national scope within the\n               national boundaries;\n       (c)     Mechanism methodology: the appropriate geographical area as determined in the\n               mechanism methodology, or a narrower scope specified in the mechanism\n               methodology for a subset of the potential users;\n       (d)     Activity participants: the location of the corresponding Article 6.4 activity, or as\n               otherwise specified in the procedure of the mechanism methodology.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3. Determination of the best available technology baseline scenario\n40.      The baseline scenario based on BAT shall be identified as:\n         (a)    An approved BAT determined by the Supervisory Body or by host Parties; or\n         (b)    A BAT specified by the mechanism methodology or determined by the activity\n                participants following a procedure in the mechanism methodology.\n41.      When considering whether a technology and/or practice is an economically feasible\n         course of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or\n         practice is one that will typically provide sufficient returns to cover investment, operations\n         & maintenance costs.\n42.      For technologies and/or practices applied in households, the mechanism methodology\n         shall define “economically viable course of action” based on the type of activity and\n         characteristics of the users. The definition may be based on the commonly experienced\n         costs associated with the technology and/or practice and shall be based on an investment\n         analysis applying financial parameters that reflect access to finance by households in a\n         manner that does not overestimate financial barriers, and other relevant considerations.\n43.      When considering whether a technology and/or practice is an environmentally sound\n         course of action, mechanism methodologies shall consider whether the technology and/or\n         practice is in line with laws and regulations on environmental protection in the applicable\n         geographical area and seeks to reasonably minimize environmental harm.5\n44.      Mechanism methodologies shall specify the appropriate baseline geographic reference\n         area for determining the BAT or provide for principles and requirements that activity\n         participants shall apply to establish this area with proper justification.\n45.      The definition of BAT specifies that the technology and/or practice “is available in the\n         baseline geographical area, meaning accessible off the shelf, or via a tendering or direct\n         contracting process, or by direct implementation by an end user within the boundary of\n         potential Article 6.4 activities”. Mechanism methodologies shall consider that when the\n         Article 6.4 activity type is greenfield and may displace the implementation of new capacity,\n         then availability relates not just to the specific activity participant, but to any entities that\n         may implement similar technologies and/or practices; whereas, when the Article 6.4\n         activity type is implemented within existing installations, the availability may be limited to\n         those technologies and/or practices available to the activity participants.\n46.      When the BAT is specified in the mechanism methodology or by the activity participants\n         following the procedure in the mechanism methodology, then the BAT shall be determined\n         by applying at least the following steps:\n         (a)    Define the technology(ies) and/or practice(s) used in the Article 6.4 activity, their\n                output(s), users, sector and, where relevant, market penetration;\n         (b)    Identify the available technologies and/or practices (and their combinations) in line\n                with the definitions in this standard for supplying the pool of users in the baseline\n                geographical reference area, at the scale required for implementation at a similar\n                level to the activity;\n\n\n5   As assessed on a mechanism methodology basis or further defined by the Supervisory Body.\n\n\n\n                                                 14 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n         (c)    Identify which of these available technologies are environmentally sound;\n         (d)    Identify which of the environmentally sound technologies are also economically\n                viable;\n         (e)    Define the emissions or removals intensity of each of the remaining technologies\n                identified in step (d) above as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-eq) per\n                unit of output, based on the average conditions of the technology in the baseline\n                geographical reference area;\n         (f)    Identify the remaining technology from step (e) above with the best emissions or\n                removals intensity. This technology constitutes the BAT and its emission or\n                removals intensity forms the basis for the baseline.\n\n6.1.4. Determination of baseline emissions or removals\n47.      The mechanism methodology shall define the procedures to quantify the baseline\n         emissions and/or removals. When the baseline scenario is set using BAT, then the\n         quantification of the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the\n         emissions or removals intensity (as tCO2-eq per unit of output) of the identified BAT.\n         However, approaches other than BAT may be used to determine other parameters\n         required to quantify the baseline emissions and/or removals.\n48.      The BAT may need to be regularly revised to update the underlying analysis. The\n         proponent of the mechanism methodology shall therefore specify the duration of the\n         validity of the proposed methodology.6\n\n6.2.     Ambitious benchmark approach\n\n6.2.1. Applicability\n49.      Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where reliable\n         data on best performing comparable activities providing similar outputs is available and\n         permits a conservative and reliable estimation of the baseline.\n50.      This approach may be particularly suitable where:\n         (a)    The sector is characterized by homogeneous outputs, i.e., if there are similar\n                outputs with a similar level of service for the pool of users; and/or\n         (b)    The emissions or removals per unit of output depend on multiple factors (inter alia,\n                technology and/or operational practices, fuels, feedstocks, local circumstances\n                such as climatic conditions).\n\n6.2.2. Determination of the baseline scenario and baseline emissions and/or removals\n51.      The baseline scenario based on an ambitious benchmark shall be identified as the\n         average emissions or removals level of the best performing comparable activities\n         providing similar outputs in a defined scope in similar social, economic, environmental,\n         and technological circumstances. Mechanism methodologies shall further specify this\n\n\n6   In case the validity of a BAT expires, users of the mechanism methodology may propose a request for\n    revision to update the underlying analysis and validity.\n\n\n\n                                                15 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n         approach and justify the methodological choices made, including specification of the\n         criteria for similarity of circumstances.\n52.      Mechanism methodologies shall either directly set the ambitious benchmark, or define a\n         procedure that activity participants shall apply for setting the crediting baseline based on\n         an ambitious benchmark, considering the following steps:7\n         (a)     Define and justify the appropriate baseline geographical reference area for the type\n                 of technology and/or practice;\n         (b)     Identify all technologies and/or practices (e.g., types of industrial plants, types of\n                 household units, as applicable to the activity type) that are providing similar output\n                 in the baseline geographical reference area in similar social, economic,\n                 environmental, and technological circumstances8;\n         (c)     Specify which comparable activities (e.g., individual installations or units such as\n                 industrial plants, households) in the baseline geographical reference area shall be\n                 included in the analysis, taking into account the type and characteristics of the\n                 Article 6.4 activity. For example, if the Article 6.4 activity consists of the installation\n                 of greenfield plants, then only recently built installations shall be included in the\n                 analysis. For brownfield Article 6.4 activities (e.g., energy efficiency\n                 improvements), existing installations may be considered, depending on the\n                 circumstances. Similarly, only activities of a similar size (e.g., plants above a\n                 certain threshold) or within certain locations (e.g., only households in rural areas)\n                 may be considered, depending on the context of the Article 6.4 activity. If an Article\n                 6.4 activity replaces existing installations while at the same expanding the capacity,\n                 comparable activities shall include installations, or combinations of installations,\n                 that can provide the same level of service as the Article 6.4 activity;\n         (d)     Select a suitable indicator for determining the performance of the comparable\n                 activities (e.g. tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, energy efficiency of\n                 appliances);\n         (e)     Determine the appropriate time period for which available performance data for all\n                 identified technologies and/or practices shall be included. In some cases, one year\n                 may be an appropriate period In cases where the performance varies significantly\n                 between calendar years (e.g., due to differences in climatic conditions such as\n                 precipitation), an appropriate multi-year period (e.g., three years) shall be selected.\n                 The choice shall be appropriately conservative and be justified;\n         (f)     Collect recent performance data for the comparable activities of the identified\n                 technologies and/or practices in the baseline geographical reference area;\n\n\n\n\n7   Mechanism methodologies may propose alternative approaches towards determining an ambitious\n    benchmark.\n8\n    For example, for cement for building construction applications, the technologies are those being\n    applied for building construction with similar structural capabilities, e.g., other cement production for\n    concrete-based construction, wood-frame construction, steel-frame construction, masonry. For another\n    example, metal-alloy production, the technologies are those being applied for the same metal-alloy\n    production.\n\n\n\n                                                   16 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n       (g)     Prepare a performance distribution curve, using the selected indicator such as\n               tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output, for the total amount of output provided\n               by the comparable activities in the baseline geographical reference area;\n       (h)     Specify how to define the group of best performing comparable activities bounded\n               at maximum by the 20th percentile of the distribution curve or lower (e.g., 10th\n               percentile, 5th percentile), and justify the choice;\n       (i)     Calculate the weighted average (by output) performance of all the best performing\n               comparable activities including and beyond the selected percentile, using the\n               selected indicator such as tonnes of CO2 equivalent per unit of output.\n53.    The value determined in sub-bullet (h) constitutes the ambitious benchmark and shall form\n       the basis for quantifying the baseline emissions and/or removals.\n54.    Mechanism methodologies shall define the methods for quantification of the ambitious\n       benchmark baseline. When the baseline scenario is set using an ambitious benchmark,\n       then the baseline emissions and/or removals shall also be derived using the benchmark.\n       However, other parameters needed to quantify baseline emissions and/or removals may\n       be derived using other approaches (for example, an ambitious benchmark for the energy\n       efficiency of comparable activities may be combined with a default value for the specific\n       GHG intensity per unit of energy).\n55.    When the ambitious benchmark is determined by activity participants, by applying a\n       procedure defined in a mechanism methodology, the mechanism methodology shall\n       specify which type of data sources may be used by activity participants. The mechanism\n       methodology should aim to ensure that the data is both of high quality and recent,\n       preferably with a vintage of no more than 3 years prior to the year in which the PDD is\n       submitted for global stakeholder consultation.\n\n6.3.   Existing actual or historical emissions approach\n\n6.3.1. Applicability\n56.    Mechanism methodologies may determine the baseline using this approach where there\n       is limited data availability on the emissions or removals performance from similar activities\n       in the sector.\n57.    This approach may be particularly suitable where:\n       (a)     Emissions or removals per unit of output are dependent on factors that are highly\n               activity- or site-specific; and/or\n       (b)     Sector data shows strongly heterogeneous circumstances.\n58.    Where an Article 6.4 activity replaces specific equipment that was used in the pre-project\n       scenario and could continue to be used, a baseline scenario determined using this\n       approach shall only remain valid until, at maximum, the end of the reasonably expected\n       remaining lifetime of the equipment that was used in the pre-activity scenario.\n\n6.3.2. Baseline scenario selection\n59.    The baseline scenario may be identified based on existing actual or historical emissions.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n60.    The mechanism methodology shall specify a pre-determined baseline scenario or contain\n       a procedure to determine the baseline scenario. Possible baseline scenarios may include:\n       (a)     The continuation of the pre-activity scenario up to a certain point in time (for\n               example, up to the time at which a retrofit would have occurred);\n       (b)     A dynamic baseline scenario over time (for example, if a gradual shift away from\n               the pre-activity scenario is observed);\n       (c)     The retrofit or replacement of equipment that has been used in the pre-activity\n               scenario;\n       (d)     The implementation of the Article 6.4 activity at a later point in time.\n\n6.3.3. Methods for quantification of baseline emissions and/or removals\n61.    The mechanism methodology shall define the methods to quantify the baseline emissions\n       and/or removals as tCO2-eq or the baseline emissions or removals intensity as tCO2-eq\n       per unit of output. The determination shall be consistent with the identified baseline\n       scenario. The baseline may be derived using the following general methods:\n       (a)     Site-specific historical data: Where this method is used, the mechanism\n               methodology shall address issues related to the minimum number of historical\n               years to consider, year-on-year variability, any trends in the historical data and the\n               need for the use of factors to account for improvements in performance that may\n               occur in the baseline scenario over time;\n       (b)     Control group: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall\n               establish requirements related to selection of the control group; shared\n               characteristics between the activity and control groups such as location, pre-\n               activity and project technologies and/or practices, and socio-economic\n               circumstances; and statistical tests for similarity between the control and activity\n               group;\n       (c)     Model: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall address the\n               selection, calibration, capabilities, credibility and conservativeness of models; and\n       (d)     Default factors: Where this method is used, the mechanism methodology shall\n               specify the source of the default factors used and ensure their relevance and\n               conservativeness.\n\n7.     Determination of the downward adjustment\n62.    Mechanism methodologies shall encourage ambition through setting crediting baselines\n       below BAU and increasing the ambition of crediting baselines over time. Therefore,\n       mechanism methodologies shall include factors or quantitative methods for downward\n       adjustment appropriate to the sector, Article 6.4 activity type and scale of the activity. The\n       factors or quantitative methods shall be based on clear and objective criteria and shall\n       result in a downward adjustment that ensures the selected baseline is below BAU and\n       encourages ambition over time.\n\n\n\n\n                                              18 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n7.1.     Downward adjustment in the calendar year of the start date of the first\n         crediting period\n63.      For baselines determined based on BAT or an ambitious benchmark, no downward\n         adjustment shall apply in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period.\n64.      For baselines determined based on existing actual or historical emissions, the downward\n         adjustment in the calendar year of the start of the first crediting period shall be determined\n         as follows:\n         (a)      Through the following step-wise procedure:\n                          i. Determine the uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval\n                             relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified unadjusted net\n                             baseline emissions and/or removals at 95% confidence level during the first\n                             crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡/ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡,𝐶𝑃1 ). The determination of the uncertainty\n                             shall consider all causes of uncertainty as per paragraph 13 of section 4 in\n                             Appendix 1;\n                       ii.

Downward adjustment in subsequent years\n65.    For all three baseline approaches in paragraph 36 of the RMPs (i.e., BAT, ambitious\n       benchmark, and existing actual or historical emissions), a downward adjustment shall\n       apply in all calendar years following the start date of the first crediting period, unless an\n       exemption in specific circumstances is approved by the Supervisory Body.\n66.    Such exemptions shall only apply to baselines based on BAT or ambitious benchmarks.\n       Economic viability could be a consideration for exemptions, for example, where the\n       application of a downward adjustment may result in no calculated emission reductions or\n       net removals.\n67.    The downward adjustment applied in subsequent years shall increase over time to\n       encourage ambition over time and ensure that the baseline is below BAU.\n68.    For baselines determined based on existing actual or historical emissions, the starting\n       point for increasing the downward adjustment over time shall be the downward adjustment\n       in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period, as determined in section\n       7.1 above. For baselines determined based on BAT or an ambitious benchmark, the\n       downward adjustment shall increase from a value of zero applied in the calendar year of\n       the start date of the first crediting period.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n69.     The increase in the downward adjustments over time shall be operationalised either as an\n        annual change or as stepwise change implemented not less frequently than every three\n        years. An increase in the downward adjustment shall be applied starting on 1 January of\n        a calendar year. The first increase shall be applied in the calendar year following the\n        calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period.\n70.     Mechanism methodology shall specify the factors or quantitative methods to calculate the\n        downward adjustment for subsequent calendar years of the crediting period and how the\n        increase over time is operationalised. The determination of the downward adjustment may\n        be based on the following principles and considerations:\n        (a)      Consideration of economic viability of the mitigation technologies and/or\n                 practices: The quantitative methods and factors could consider the economic\n                 viability of the relevant mitigation activities. This holds in particular for critical\n                 mitigation activities, large-scale transformation and decarbonization technologies,\n                 and negative emission approaches. The quantitative methods and factors could\n                 result in relatively lower downward adjustments for these technologies and\n                 approaches, and other critical technologies at an early stage of innovation and\n                 diffusion, compared with technologies and/or practices that are closer to being\n                 economically viable;\n        (b)      Setting incentives for the adoption of less GHG intensive technologies\n                 and/or practices: The factors and quantitative methods could result in a relatively\n                 higher downward adjustment for more GHG intensive technologies and/or\n                 practices and a relatively lower downward adjustment for less GHG intensive\n                 technologies and/or practices10;\n        (c)      Consideration of established long-term pathways: Already established long-\n                 term pathways for emissions, technologies and/or practices adopted by Parties,\n                 groups of Parties and/or international industry associations could inform the\n                 downward adjustment. This could mean that some sectors, regions or Parties\n                 would have greater annual increases to the downward adjustment compared with\n                 others;\n        (d)      Consideration of concept of sufficiency: Considering work on sufficiency\n                 presented in IPCC AR6 WGIII, Chapter 9, the factors and quantitative methods\n                 could result in a relatively higher downward adjustment for activities implemented\n                 in a context of high resource consumption patterns and a relatively lower downward\n                 adjustment for lower resource consumption patterns11;\n        (e)      Consideration of suppressed demand: The quantitative methods and factors\n                 could result in a relatively lower downward adjustment for sectors or regions where\n                 demand is suppressed.\n\n\n\n\n10 For example, the downward adjustment may be higher for Article 6.4 activities flaring landfill gas than for\n\n  activities using the landfill gas as fuel;\n11 For example, in the buildings sector, it may be proposed that for communities whose energy consumption\n\n  was historically high, the rate of reducing emissions is higher than that for communities with historically\n  low energy consumption\n\n\n\n                                                  21 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n71.    The annual increase in the downward adjustment shall correspond to at least 1% of the\n       baseline emissions in the calendar year of the start date of the first crediting period. A pro-\n       rata approach may be used to apply this minimum value to periods other than a full\n       calendar year.\n\n8.     Determination of a conservative                                 business-as-usual\n       baseline\n72.    Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to demonstrate that the downward\n       adjusted baseline is below BAU. For that purpose, mechanism methodologies shall\n       require the identification of a conservative BAU scenario that would occur in the absence\n       of the Article 6.4 activity and provide a method for the quantification of the corresponding\n       BAU emissions and/or removals in a conservative manner. The BAU also may be defined\n       using an approved standardized baseline.\n73.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall consider the following alternatives for\n       the purpose of determining the BAU scenario and justify the choice, including how it\n       ensures conservativeness:\n       (a)     Continuation of the historical situation (pre-activity scenario);\n       (b)     Establishment of an economically viable technology and/or practice;\n       (c)     A scenario combining (a) for the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or\n               practice, followed afterwards by (b); or\n       (d)     Only when it is justified that the previous alternatives are not suitable, another\n               relevant scenario in line with the applicable principles and requirements set out in\n               this standard.\n74.    Where several scenarios are plausible, the most conservative scenario shall be chosen\n       as the BAU scenario.\n75.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology may consider the following approaches for\n       estimating the BAU emissions and/or removals and shall justify the choice:\n       (a)     Where the activity is not a greenfield activity, mechanism methodologies may\n               consider the historical emissions or emissions intensity prior to the implementation\n               of the activity, including any trends toward improving performance, for the\n               remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice; or\n       (b)     Where the activity is a greenfield activity, or where it operates beyond the end of\n               the remaining lifetime of the existing equipment and/or practice, mechanism\n               methodologies may consider the average emissions intensity of new capacity\n               installed in the past three years, in the baseline geographical reference area,\n               and/or in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances\n               and providing similar outputs as the activity with these criteria specified further in\n               the mechanism methodology.\n\n\n\n\n                                               22 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n76.     In determining the BAU scenario and quantifying the BAU emissions and/or removals\n        pursuant to paragraphs 72 to 75 above, mechanism methodologies shall identify and\n        incorporate in the BAU:\n        (a)       Any policies that are active or scheduled to take effect within the crediting period,\n                  unless they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for\n                  implementation. All legal requirements shall be deemed to be enforced while\n                  recognizing that regulatory environments vary; and\n        (b)       Any specific national or sub-national targets for the sector or the type of activity, as\n                  long as these are supported by policy frameworks for implementation12, but not\n                  general goals that are not specific to the sector or type of activity.\n77.     Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the comparison of the downward adjusted\n        baseline with the BAU baseline in section 5 (Step 5 in Figure 1) results in the determination\n        of a crediting baseline that is below BAU. For this purpose, mechanism methodologies\n        shall identify the conservative BAU baseline as follows:\n        (a)       Through the following step-wise procedure:\n                       i. Determine the uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval\n                          relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified BAU net baseline\n                          emissions and/or removals during the first crediting period (𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 ).\n                          The determination of the uncertainty shall consider all causes of\n                          uncertainty as per paragraph 13 in Appendix 1;\n                      ii. Determine the conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals\n                          based on uncertainty for the relevant year or period (BAUcons,UNC,y), as\n                          follows13;\n\n          𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 ∗ (1 − 𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦 )                                    Equation (4)\n\n\n         Where:\n                               Uncertainty at the lower bound of the uncertainty interval\n                               relative to the central estimate of the ex-ante quantified most\n          𝑈𝑁𝐶𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝐶𝑃1,𝑦     =\n                               likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals during the\n                               first crediting period year y (fraction)\n                               Conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based\n          𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦    =\n                               on uncertainty in year y\n                               Most likely net BAU baseline emissions and/or removals in\n          𝐵𝐴𝑈,𝑦            =\n                               year y\n          y                =   Relevant year or period (see instructions below)\n\n\n\n12 The extent to which the policy frameworks in place are sufficient to enable the achievement of the targets\n\n  may be considered in determining their relevance for the BAU scenario and quantification, as well as\n  whether they refer to or formally integrate the mechanism as an instrument for implementation.\n13 Where, for the uncertainty of a central value, the absolute upper bound of the uncertainty interval is a\n\n  positive number and the absolute lower bound of the uncertainty interval a negative number, or vice-\n  versa, further guidance will be developed.\n\n\n\n                                                  23 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n                     iii. Determine the minimum conservative value of the BAU baseline during the\n                          first crediting period as follows:\n\n       𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 = 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 − (𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑦 − 𝐴𝐸𝑦 ) ∗ 0.1                                      Equation (5)\n\n\n       Where:\n                                Minimum conservative BAU baseline emissions\n        𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦       =\n                                and/or removals in year y\n        𝐴𝐸𝑦                 =   Activity emissions and/or removals in year y\n\n        Y                   =   Relevant year or period (see instructions below)\n\n                     iv. Compare the conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals based\n                         on uncertainty (BAUcons,UNC,y) and the minimum conservative BAU baseline\n                         emissions and/or removals (BAUcons,min,y) and select the lower as the\n                         conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals;\n\n        𝐵𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑦 = min(𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑦 , 𝐵𝐴𝑈𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑈𝑁𝐶,𝑦 )                                   Equation (6)\n\n\n       Where:\n                                Conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or\n        𝐵𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑦            =\n                                removals in year y\n                                Relevant year or period (see instructions\n        y                   =\n                                below)\n\n                OR\n       (b)      Propose another approach that ensures that the selected crediting baseline is\n                below BAU, considering the minimum discount described in the method above.\n78.    The BAU scenario and quantification of the BAU emissions and/or removals shall be\n       determined:\n       (a)      Ex ante in the PDD at the start of the first crediting period for the same duration as\n                the crediting period of the proposed Article 6.4 activity, specifying the BAU\n                emissions and/or removals for each calendar year within the crediting period; and\n       (b)      Ex post for each calendar year within the crediting period.\n79.    For the ex-post quantification of the BAU baseline emissions and/or removals, mechanism\n       methodologies shall specify which parameters are determined ex-ante and remain fixed\n       for the crediting period and which parameters are updated for each calendar year or at a\n       different frequency.\n80.    The BAU scenario shall be redetermined at each crediting period renewal and the same\n       analysis shall be carried out.\n\n\n\n\n                                                24 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n9.     Comparison and selection of crediting baseline\n81.    Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to require activity participants to\n       undertake the following comparisons.\n82.    Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to compare, ex-ante in the\n       project design document, the following two baselines:\n       (a)     The downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3; and\n       (b)     The conservative BAU baseline resulting from Step 4.\n83.    Where the ex-ante conservative BAU baseline emissions and/or removals is lower than\n       the ex-ante downward adjusted baseline for any calendar year or cumulatively over the\n       crediting period, then the mechanism methodology shall require the activity participant to\n       return to Step 3 and revise the quantitative methods and factors to determine the\n       downward adjustment, to ensure that the downward adjusted baseline is lower than the\n       conservative BAU baseline for each calendar year and cumulatively for the crediting\n       period.\n84.    Mechanism methodologies shall further require activity participants to compare, ex-post\n       in monitoring reports, for each individual calendar year during the crediting period, the ex-\n       post calculated downward adjusted baseline for the year and the ex-post calculated\n       conservative BAU baseline for the same year and confirm that the downward adjusted\n       baseline is lower than the conservative BAU baseline. If it is not, then the conservative\n       BAU baseline shall be used for that calendar year.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\nAppendix 1. General requirements for mechanism\n            methodologies\n\n1.        Applicability conditions\n1.        Mechanism methodologies shall specify the conditions under which proposed Article 6.4\n          activities may use the methodology. Applicability conditions shall clearly describe the\n          technologies and/or practices which are eligible under a methodology as well as, if\n          appropriate, those which are not.\n2.        Applicability conditions shall also prevent the use of the methodologies in contexts,\n          configurations and cases for which these are not intended and under which an\n          overestimation of emission reductions or net removals and/or perverse incentives could\n          occur.\n3.        For each applicability condition, the mechanism methodology shall specify whether the\n          fulfilment of the condition shall be assessed:\n          (a)     Once at the initial validation of the PDD or, where the information is not yet\n                  available, at the first verification of emission reductions or net removals; or\n          (b)     At each verification of emission reductions or net removals.\n\n2.        Definition of the activity boundary\n4.        The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all emission sources, sinks or\n          reservoirs that could be altered by Article 6.4 activities that are eligible under the\n          methodology. For each identified source, sink or reservoir, the proponent shall indicate\n          whether it pertains to the baseline scenario and/or the Article 6.4 activity scenario. The\n          proponent shall compare the sources, sinks and reservoirs between the two scenarios in\n          a tabular format to ensure a complete and fair comparison.\n5.        The proponent shall further indicate whether each identified source, sink and reservoir is\n          controlled, related to, or otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4 activities, in line\n          with the definitions, and provide adequate justification. Note that some sources, sinks or\n          reservoirs may be classified in different ways, depending on the configuration of the Article\n          6.4 activity1; where applicable, this should be indicated.\n6.        Based on this analysis, mechanism methodologies shall define the activity boundary of\n          the applicable Article 6.4 activities, including which emission sources, sinks or reservoirs\n          and GHGs are included. The activity boundary shall be presented in table, covering both\n          the Article 6.4 activity scenario and the baseline scenario.\n\n\n\n\n1    For example, in some activities, a source of transport emissions may be controlled whereas in others it\n     may be related.\n\n\n                                                   26 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n7.        The activity boundary shall include all emission sources, sinks or reservoirs that are\n          identified as controlled or related. The activity boundary also may include sources, sinks\n          or reservoirs that are identified as otherwise affected by the applicable Article 6.4\n          activities. 2 Changes in anthropogenic emissions and/or removals of GHGs that occur\n          outside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity shall be considered\n          as leakage, subject to the provisions in the draft standard “Addressing leakage in\n          mechanism methodologies”.\n8.        Mechanism methodologies may omit sources, sinks or GHGs from the activity boundary,\n          provided that the omission leads to a more conservative quantification of emission\n          reductions or net removals. For example, where it can be demonstrated for the range of\n          activities that may apply the methodology that upstream emissions associated with the\n          Article 6.4 scenario are lower than upstream emissions associated with the baseline\n          scenario, the relevant upstream emissions may be omitted in both the Article 6.4 activity\n          scenario and the baseline scenario. The mechanism methodology may also specify\n          conditions under which certain sources, sinks, reservoirs or GHGs shall be considered or\n          may be omitted. The proponent of the mechanism methodology shall demonstrate and\n          provide appropriate justifications for any such omissions, including that the omission is\n          conservative for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology.\n9.        Mechanism methodologies shall require activity participants to delineate the geographical\n          boundary of a proposed Article 6.4 activity. Mechanism methodologies may require activity\n          participants to specify the location of the activity in the form of Keyhole Markup Language\n          files or similar formats as one or more polygon(s), by specifying the coordinates of the\n          geographic boundary using a known coordinate system or any other method to delineate\n          the geographic boundary. The geographic boundary may cover more than one host Party.\n          Where appropriate, the mechanism methodology may request the location of the leakage\n          emission sources and sinks to be described as well.\n10.       Mechanism methodologies shall require demonstration that the activity, does not\n          constrain, but aligns with the policies, options and implementation plans of the host Party\n          with regard to the nationally determined contribution (NDC) of the host Party, its long-term\n          low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS), if it has submitted one,\n          and the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and long-term goals of the\n          Paris Agreement through an assessment, undertaken by the DNA of the host Party, of the\n          activity’s consistency with Decision 3/CMA.3 paragraph 40 (c) and paragraph 27 (a) as\n          part of the host Party’s approval.\n\n3.        Calculation of emission reductions or net removals\n11.       Mechanisms methodologies shall include provisions to determine emission reductions or\n          net removals separately for each calendar year. To address situations where monitoring\n          periods cover more than one calendar year, mechanism methodologies shall specify\n          methods to allocate the emission reductions or net removals achieved during a monitoring\n          period to calendar years. The method of allocation shall be based on the best\n\n\n\n\n2    For example, for activities that provide renewable electricity to the grid and thereby affect electricity\n     generation by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a\n     baseline emission source within the activity boundary.\n\n\n\n                                                    27 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       approximation for when the emission reductions or net removals have likely occurred. The\n       following approaches shall be used:\n       (a)     Proportional allocation: Where this is plausible, emissions or removals in the\n               monitoring period shall be allocated proportionally to the duration of the period in\n               each calendar year. If annual caps or other annual values are applied in the\n               methodology, these shall be pro-rated to periods shorter than a full calendar year;\n       (b)     Allocation based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns: Where\n               proportional allocation is not plausible, emissions or removals in the monitored\n               period shall be allocated based on likely expected or observed trends or patterns.\n               For example, for an afforestation activity, growth tables for the respective species\n               and local conditions may be used to allocate a stock change observed over a multi-\n               year period to individual calendar years;\n12.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify whether the type of Article 6.4 activities covered\n       by the methodology may generate emission reductions, net removals, or both emission\n       reductions and net removals. Where Article 6.4 activities may generate both emission\n       reductions and net removals, mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to\n       separately determine the emission reductions and the net removals that have occurred in\n       a monitoring period.\n\n4.     Conservativeness and uncertainty\n13.    Mechanism methodologies shall apply a conservative approach to ensure that the\n       emission reductions or net removals from an Article 6.4 activity using the methodology are\n       very unlikely to be overestimated, taking into account the overall uncertainty in quantifying\n       the emission reductions or net removals. The implementation of conservativeness (e.g.,\n       through conservative assumptions, parameters, discounts) in determining the calculated\n       emission reductions or net removals shall be based on the level of uncertainty (e.g.,\n       applying a larger deduction in case of higher uncertainties). All causes of uncertainty shall\n       be considered, including uncertainty in data (e.g., measurements), parameters (e.g.,\n       representativeness of default values), assumptions (e.g., the baseline scenario), and\n       methods (e.g., models to quantify emission reductions).\n\n5.     Attributability of emission reductions or net removals to the Article 6.4\n       activity\n14.    Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that the quantified emission reductions or net\n       removals result from the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity and not from changes in\n       exogenous factors that are not related to the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity.\n       Mechanism methodologies shall therefore require approaches that take into account and\n       adjust for exogenous factors affecting emission reductions or net removals.\n\n6.     Potential perverse incentives\n15.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify any potential perverse\n       incentives for the activity participants to inflate the calculated emissions reductions or net\n       removals. This may include cases where output levels could increase as a result of the\n       incentive of the mechanism. Where such perverse incentives can occur, the mechanism\n       methodology shall ensure that they are avoided.\n\n\n\n\n                                              28 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n7.     Rebound effects\n16.    Mechanism methodologies shall ensure that rebound effects (i.e., an increase in the level\n       of service as a result of the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity, e.g., when introducing\n       energy-efficient appliances) are accounted for. Where applying the provisions with regard\n       to suppressed demand, further requirements or guidance from relevant other standard(s)\n       may be considered.\n\n8.     Avoidance of double counting\n17.    The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify risks of potential double\n       counting of the emission reductions or net removals and, where such risks are relevant\n       and material, include provisions to avoid such double counting in the mechanism\n       methodology. This shall include but not be limited to:\n       (a)     Double counting due to overlapping claims between different crediting mechanism\n               activities;\n       (b)     Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes; and\n       (c)     Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets.\n\n8.1.   Double counting due to overlapping claims between different carbon crediting\n       mechanism activities\n18.    Double counting may occur if different carbon crediting mechanism activities claim the\n       same emission reductions or removals. The consideration of this form of double counting\n       shall include but not be limited to:\n       (a)     The risk of different entities claiming the emission reductions or removals\n               associated with the production and use of goods or services (e.g., both the\n               producer and the consumer of a biofuel claiming the same emission reductions);\n       (b)     The risk of overlap from emission sources or carbon pools that occur upstream and\n               downstream of the activity (e.g., an efficient cookstove activity and an avoided\n               deforestation activity claiming the same emission reductions);\n       (c)     The risk of overlap due to implementation of activities at different aggregation\n               levels within the same geographical area (e.g., a project-scale avoided\n               deforestation activity falling within the scope of a jurisdictional avoided\n               deforestation activity).\n19.    This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by requiring\n       agreement between the entities that may potentially seek carbon credits for the same\n       emission reductions or removals.\n\n8.2.   Double counting due to overlap with mandatory domestic mitigation schemes\n20.    Double counting may occur if an Article 6.4 activity reduces emissions or enhances\n       removals that are covered by a mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g. an emissions\n\n\n\n\n                                              29 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       trading system). This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies\n       by:\n       (a)     Excluding activities or not issuing Article 6.4 ERs for emission reductions or\n               removals that are subject to such overlap; or\n       (b)     Requiring that measures are in place to ensure that any relevant impacts of the\n               activity (e.g., inter alia the GHG emission reductions achieved or the kilowatt-hours\n               of renewable electricity produced) are not counted towards the achievement of\n               targets or obligations under the mandatory domestic mitigation scheme (e.g., inter\n               alia by cancelling allowances from the emissions trading system before issuing\n               carbon credits).\n\n8.3.   Double counting due to overlap with other frameworks or environmental markets\n21.    Double counting may occur if the mitigation outcomes achieved by an Article 6.4 activity\n       are also claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets (e.g. guarantees of origin\n       for renewable electricity generation, green hydrogen schemes, low carbon fuel standards,\n       etc.). Note that this only holds if mitigation outcomes (e.g., emission reductions, removal\n       enhancements, renewable energy generation, energy efficiency improvements, etc.) are\n       claimed in other frameworks or environmental markets, but not where other outcomes\n       (e.g., air contaminant reductions or social impacts) are claimed.\n22.    This risk could, for example, be addressed in mechanism methodologies by:\n       (a)     Excluding activities or not issuing Article 6.4 emission reductions for emission\n               reductions or removals that are subject to such overlap; or\n       (b)     Requiring that the Article 6.4 activity does not claim the same mitigation outcomes\n               in the relevant other environmental markets or accounting frameworks.\n\n9.     Monitoring\n23.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify procedures and methods for the monitoring all\n       data and parameters necessary to calculate the emission reductions or net removals from\n       Article 6.4 activities using the methodology.\n24.    Further requirements related to monitoring may be introduced in this standard in the future.\n\n10.    Aggregation of information\n25.    Where appropriate, mechanism methodologies may consolidate information within a\n       geographical area and a sector, to provide observations at a broader level than an\n       individual Article 6.4 activity. Comparable activities can be grouped or aggregated to\n       provide a broader picture when this does not lead to misrepresentation. Comparable\n       activities can also be split or disaggregated, when this does not lead to misrepresentation,\n       for example when the sector shows great heterogeneity.\n\n11.    Validity and periodic updating of mechanism methodologies\n26.    In accordance with the “Procedure: Development, revision and clarification of\n       methodologies and methodological tools”, approved methodologies and methodological\n       tools that have been applied in projects shall be reviewed on a regular basis. The review\n       particularly shall seek to incorporate, or substitute, sources and types of data, and update\n       the methodological approaches and assumptions, to enhance the application of the\n\n\n                                              30 of 31\nA6.4-STAN-METH-004\nStandard: Setting the baseline in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n           principles and general requirements in section 4 of this standard. This may include the\n           adoption of new measurement approaches, such as the use of remote sensing and digital\n           technologies. Each version of a mechanism methodology shall specify until when it is valid\n           for use, taking into account the methodological approaches, assumptions and data\n           sources used in the methodology, as well as trends and developments in the sector. The\n           validity shall not exceed five years.\n\n                                                     -----\n\n\n                                        Document information\n\n Version          Date                 Description\n\n\n 01.0             16 May 2025          SBM 016, Annex 12.\n                                       Initial adoption.\n\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Standard\n Business Function: Methodology\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, baseline scenario, methodologies, standardized baselines\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31 of 31\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Scope\n1.        This standard sets out requirements for mechanism methodologies to first identify\n          potential sources of leakage, then seek to avoid or, where this is not possible, minimize\n          any negative leakage, and subsequently calculate and subtract any remaining negative\n          leakage of an Article 6.4 activity.\n\n1.2.      Entry into force\n2.        This document enters into force on 16 May 2025.\n\n2.        Definitions\n3.        The following definitions shall apply:\n          (a)     Activity participant: A public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4\n                  activity;\n          (b)     Activity boundary: The boundary that encompasses the greenhouse gas (GHG)\n                  sources, sinks and reservoirs that are controlled or related. The activity boundary\n                  may also include GHG sources, sinks or reservoirs that are otherwise affected by\n                  the activity;1\n          (c)     Controlled sources, sinks and reservoirs: GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs\n                  that are under the direction and influence of the activity participant through\n                  financial, policy, management or other instruments;\n          (d)     Leakage: Changes in anthropogenic emissions and/or removals of GHGs that\n                  occur outside the activity boundary and that are attributable to the activity, including\n                  those resulting from changes in market demand or supply for associated outputs.\n                  Leakage may involve the following sub-forms:\n                  (i)    Positive leakage: Leakage where the implementation of an Article 6.4\n                         activity results in a decrease in emissions and/or an increase in removals;\n                  (ii)   Negative leakage: Leakage where the implementation of an Article 6.4\n                         activity results in an increase in emissions and/or a decrease in removals;\n          (e)     Level of service: The quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an\n                  Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;\n          (f)     Output: Each good or service provided by the Article 6.4 activity and/or in the\n                  baseline scenario2, as specified in the mechanism methodology;\n\n\n\n1    For example, for activities that provide renewable electricity to the grid and thereby affect electricity\n     generation by power plants in the grid, the emissions from power plants in the grid may be treated as a\n     baseline emission source within the activity boundary. Furthermore, note that in the case of activities\n     implemented at project-scale, the activity boundary is equivalent to the project boundary.\n2    For example, electricity, energy for cooking, or municipal waste management.\n\n\n\n                                                     3 of 8\nA6.4-STAN-METH-005\nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n          (g)    Related sources, sinks and reservoirs: GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs that\n                 have material or energy flows into, out of, or within the Article 6.4 activity.\n\n3.        Applicability\n4.        This standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to both emission reductions\n          and net removals.\n5.        This version of the standard is applicable to mechanism methodologies for activities\n          undertaken at the project level. The standard may be amended in the future to cover\n          methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other scales (e.g., programmes of\n          activities, policies, sectoral approaches).\n6.        The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For\n          simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard.\n\n4.        General requirements\n7.        Mechanism methodologies shall include all leakage sources in the calculation of emission\n          reductions or net removals, unless their exclusion is conservative (e.g., the exclusion of a\n          source of positive leakage). Where the proponent of a mechanism methodology can\n          demonstrate that, for the range of Article 6.4 activities that may apply the methodology,\n          certain positive leakage sources are consistently larger than certain negative leakage\n          sources, then these leakage sources may be omitted in the calculation of emission\n          reductions and/or net removals.\n8.        The proponent of mechanism methodologies shall assess whether the implementation of\n          Article 6.4 activities covered by the methodology could lead to any changes in the type(s)\n          of output or level(s) of service provided as compared to the baseline scenario. When the\n          type(s) of output or the level(s) of service provided in the Article 6.4 activity scenario\n          change compared to the baseline scenario, this can result in leakage3. Such leakage shall\n          either be:\n          (a)    Prevented by designing the Article 6.4 activity in such a way that the same type(s)\n                 of output or level(s) of service is provided in the Article 6.4 activity scenario as in\n                 the baseline scenario (e.g., by providing respective applicability conditions or\n                 expanding the geographical activity boundary); or\n          (b)    Addressed by quantifying and subtracting any negative leakage resulting from the\n                 change in the type(s) of output or level(s) of service.\n9.        The relevant geographical area for consideration of leakage may not be limited to national\n          boundaries and shall include international leakage (i.e., leakage beyond national\n          boundaries) where this occurs.\n10.       If the sum of all sources of leakage results in a net decrease in GHG emissions or increase\n          in GHG removals, then the resulting leakage shall be set equal to zero in the quantification\n          of the emission reductions or net removals.\n\n\n\n\n3    For example, a renewable power plant constructed on agricultural land could lead to a change in the\n     type or level(s) of agricultural production.\n\n\n\n                                                  4 of 8\nA6.4-STAN-METH-005\nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n5.       Procedures to address leakage\n11.      Mechanism methodologies shall contain provisions to first identify potential sources of\n         leakage, then seek to avoid or, where this is not possible, to minimize any negative\n         leakage and subsequently calculate and subtract any remaining negative leakage as per\n         the specifications below.\n\n5.1.     Identification of leakage\n12.      The proponent of a mechanism methodology shall identify all potential sources of leakage\n         for the type of mitigation activities covered by the methodology. This shall include, but not\n         be limited to, the following sources of leakage:\n         (a)     Baseline equipment transfer: This source of leakage is relevant where:\n                 (i)     Equipment used within the activity boundary prior to the implementation of\n                         the Article 6.4 activity would continue to be used in the baseline scenario and\n                         is being replaced under the Article 6.4 activity scenario; and\n                 (ii)    The replaced equipment is functional, has a value for third parties and could\n                         continue to be used outside of the activity boundary where it may potentially\n                         displace less GHG intensive processes4;\n         (b)     Competition for resource use5: This source of leakage is relevant where:\n                 (i)     The Article 6.4 activity increases, relative to the baseline scenario, the\n                         consumption of resources that have competing uses;\n                 (ii)    The availability of the resources is limited within the relevant geographical\n                         area; and\n                 (iii)   The potential diversion of the resources from other uses to the Article 6.4\n                         activity could lead to an increase in GHG gas emissions or decrease of\n                         removals outside the activity boundary;\n         (c)     Diversion of existing production processes or outputs: This source of leakage is\n                 relevant where6:\n                 (i)     The type(s) of output or level(s) of services provided under the Article 6.4\n                         activity changes compared to the baseline scenario; and\n\n\n\n\n4   For example, this may occur as a result of replacing a fossil-fuel boiler with a biomass boiler where the\n    fossil-fuel boiler is re-used in another location.\n5   For example, this may happen where biomass is used to replace fossil fuel but the resulting scarcity in\n    biomass leads current biomass users to switch to fossil-fuels. Another example is the use of agricultural\n    by-products as fuels or feedstocks, where the diversion of biomass from application on fields to\n    alternative uses may result in an increased use of synthetic fertilizer.\n6   For example, this may be applicable to activities that involve, shifting pre-project activities, such as\n    grazing or agriculture, outside of the activity boundary, as a result of changes in management or use of\n    land.\n\n\n\n                                                    5 of 8\nA6.4-STAN-METH-005\nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n                 (ii)   The change could lead to an increase in emissions and/or a decrease in\n                        removals outside the activity boundary7;\n         (d)     Increases in release of GHGs from the environment as a result of implementing\n                 the Article 6.4 activity.8\n13.      The requirement in paragraph 12(b) above may not apply to fossil fuels or mineral products\n         considering that their availability can be expanded through increased extraction in case of\n         increased demand.\n\n5.2.     Avoidance or minimisation of leakage\n14.      Mechanism methodologies shall include provisions to seek to avoid or, where this is not\n         possible, to minimize all identified sources of negative leakage by applying, inter alia, the\n         approaches below as appropriate for the given sector and the type of mitigation activities\n         covered by the methodology. Avoiding or minimizing leakage may be done, for example,\n         by limiting the scope of applicability conditions, as follows:\n         (a)     If baseline equipment transfer is identified as a potential source of leakage,\n                 mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions that require the\n                 destruction, decommission or disposal of the baseline equipment and the provision\n                 of relevant evidence9;\n         (b)     If competition for resource use is identified as a potential source of leakage,\n                 mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions to demonstrate\n                 abundance of such resource and that such resource would not be used in the\n                 baseline scenario. Abundance demonstrations shall be based on requirements\n                 provided for in methodologies and shall account for the economic and\n                 environmental impacts of diverting resources from prior use cases, including with\n                 respect to the sustainable use of natural or human-managed ecosystems;10\n         (c)     If changes in the type of output(s) or level(s) of service are identified as a potential\n                 source of leakage, mechanism methodologies can include applicability conditions\n                 requiring the demonstration of equivalence of output(s) and level(s) of service.11\n15.      As per paragraph 87 of the Methodologies Standard12, if the proposed activity falls under\n         the scope of Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement (i.e., REDD+ activities),\n         mechanism methodologies shall further require demonstration that the activity is included\n\n\n7   For example, this may occur where agricultural production is reduced because of the activity and new\n    production is established on land that was previously forested.\n8   For example, this may consist in increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils in a wetland if the water\n    level is lowered due to the implementation of an Article 6.4 activity due to an activity on a neighboring\n    land.\n9   For example, methodologies can establish applicability conditions to require baseline refrigeration\n    equipment to undergo refrigerant recovery and destruction as well as scrapping of the equipment.\n10 For example, methodologies can establish applicability conditions to prevent soil depletion by requiring\n\n    that a minimum amount of biomass must be retained per unit of land.\n11 For example, if reforestation Article 6.4 activities could result in diversion of pre-project activities such as\n\n    agriculture, mechanism methodologies can include conditions which limit applicability to activities on\n    degraded lands which do not result in such diversion.\n12 See https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-METH-001.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      6 of 8\nA6.4-STAN-METH-005\nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       in all the elements required of the host Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71. This\n       demonstration shall be done using official documentation from the host country\n       communicated to the UNFCCC secretariat pursuant to relevant guidance and decisions,\n       as follows:\n       (a)    The proposed A6.4 activity is included in the host country’s national strategy or\n              action plan referred to in decision 1/CP.16, para 71(a);\n       (b)    Inclusion of the geographical activity boundary in the host country’s national forest\n              reference emission level and/or forest reference level referred to in decision\n              1/CP.16, para 71(b);\n       (c)    Inclusion of the geographical activity boundary in the national forest monitoring\n              system referred to in decision 1/CP.16, para 71(c);\n       (d)    The proposed A6.4 activity is included in and reports to the system for providing\n              information on safeguards referred to in 1/CP.16, para 71(d) (without prejudice to\n              the use of the SD Tool).\n16.    If the proposed A6.4 activity is not yet included in all the elements required of the host\n       Party as per decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 71, mechanism methodologies may require, on\n       an interim basis, a letter from the host country’s national entity or focal point referred to in\n       decision 2/CP.10 (i.e., the REDD+ focal point) indicating when the proposed A6.4 activity\n       will be included in all the elements above. The inclusion shall occur no later than\n       Verification and be verified by the DOE.\n\n5.3.   Calculation and subtraction of leakage\n17.    If negative leakage cannot be avoided through measures such as those indicated in the\n       preceding section, mechanism methodologies shall include procedures to calculate the\n       remaining net leakage (i.e., the balance of any positive and negative leakage) and, should\n       the net leakage be negative, subtract it in the quantification of emission reductions or net\n       removals.\n18.    Where baseline equipment transfer cannot be avoided by measures such as destruction,\n       decommissioning or disposal of the baseline equipment, mechanism methodologies shall\n       provide approaches to calculate any resulting negative leakage from continued use of the\n       equipment. Such approaches may need to consider: the remaining lifetime of the\n       equipment, the possible usage scenarios and the usage rate of the equipment (e.g., how\n       many hours within a year the equipment is used), the GHG emissions intensity of the\n       transferred equipment and the type and GHG intensity of the equipment that is being\n       replaced by the transferred equipment.\n19.    Where the use of competing resources cannot be avoided through demonstration of\n       abundance and non-use in the baseline scenario, mechanism methodologies shall include\n       procedures to account for any resulting negative leakage. Such procedures may include\n       consideration of the quantity of resources used under the Article 6.4 activity that are\n       subject to competing uses, the likely alternatives to those resources, and the associated\n       emissions or removals resulting from the use of those alternatives.\n20.    Where the type(s) of output and/or level(s) of service in the Article 6.4 activity scenario\n       differ from those in the baseline scenario (e.g., due to diversion of production processes\n       or outputs), mechanism methodologies shall specify the approach to quantify and subtract\n       any resulting negative leakage in the calculation of emission reductions and/or net\n\n\n\n\n                                                7 of 8\nA6.4-STAN-METH-005\nStandard: Addressing leakage in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n           removals. The approach shall ensure that leakage arising from changes in the type(s) of\n           output and/or level(s) of service is appropriately accounted for.13\n\n21.        Article 6.4 activities are ineligible to earn A6.4 emission reductions where the\n           implementation of the Article 6.4 activity leads to a decrease in the type(s) of output and/or\n           level(s) of service relative to the baseline scenario, unless the mechanism methodology\n           fully accounts for any negative leakage effects resulting from the decrease in the type(s)\n           of output and/or level(s) of service in the calculation of emission reductions and/or net\n           removals and the proponent of the mechanism methodology provides appropriate\n           justifications for the full consideration.\n\n                                                      -----\n\n\n                                         Document information\n\n Version        Date                    Description\n\n\n 01.0            16 May 2025            SBM 016, Annex 13.\n                                        Initial adoption.\n\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Standard\n Business Function: Methodology\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, leakage, methodologies\n\n\n\n\n13 For example, improved forest management activities, such as extending the rotation age of trees, may\n\n  reduce the level of timber harvesting. This could result in different forms of leakage, such as increased\n  harvesting in other locations or the substitution of forest products by other GHG intensive materials (e.g.,\n  replacing wood by steel and cement in the building sector). Another example is a reforestation activity\n  that could result in diversion of pre-project activities, such as agriculture.

Introduction\n1.1.   Scope\n1.     This Standard sets out requirements for recognizing suppressed demand in mechanism\n       methodologies. This Standard aims to facilitate a consistent and appropriate consideration\n       of approaches for addressing suppressed demand. It provides requirements on how to\n       identify the service level that fulfils basic human needs and identify the baseline\n       technology and/or practice where suppressed demand exists, and the means to monitor\n       whether suppressed demand conditions persist during the crediting period.\n2.     The Standard will be applied by the mechanism methodology proponents developing new\n       mechanism methodologies or proposing revisions to existing ones, and by the secretariat,\n       the Methodological Expert Panel (MEP) and the Supervisory Body in assessing and\n       considering proposed mechanism methodologies for approval. The standard is not\n       intended for the preparation of project design documents (PDDs) or monitoring reports.\n\n1.2.   Entry into force\n3.     This document enters into force on 7 August 2025.\n\n2.     Definitions\n4.     The following definitions shall apply:\n       (a)    Activity participant: A public or private entity that participates in an Article 6.4\n              activity;\n       (b)    Basic human needs: Physical and physiological needs considered essential for\n              minimum quality of life, such as water, food, housing, sanitation (waste\n              treatment/disposal, and wastewater treatment), access to energy services\n              (including lighting, cooking, and thermal comforts including heating or cooling),\n              mobility, communications and education, health and economic activities such as\n              agriculture;\n       (c)    Business-as-usual (BAU): Plausible reference benchmark or scenario for GHG\n              emissions or removals prior to or in the absence of the implementation of the\n              proposed Article 6.4 activity. It may be a scenario, emission or removal level, or an\n              emissions or removals intensity;\n       (d)    Level of service: The quality, reliability and scale of an output provided by an\n              Article 6.4 activity and/or in the baseline scenario;\n       (e)    Level of service for meeting basic human needs: The threshold below which\n              an individual is considered to face deprivation of basic human needs;\n       (f)    Suppressed demand: A situation where services provided to a population are\n              insufficient to meet the basic human needs due to barriers, such as low income or\n              lack of infrastructure, and where the growth of emissions resulting from meeting\n              such needs requires special consideration in the assessment of Article 6.4 baseline\n              scenarios;\n\n\n\n\n                                                3 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n          (g)     Suppressed demand baseline: A crediting baseline that is established for the\n                  provision of services that address basic human needs.\n\n3.        Applicability\n5.        The standard applies to mechanism methodologies and methodological tools. For\n          simplicity, only the term mechanism methodology is used in this standard.\n6.        The standard applies to mechanism methodologies related to emission reductions. It does\n          not apply to mechanism methodologies for activities involving removals1.\n7.        Mechanism methodologies may recognise suppressed demand where:\n          (a)     Neither the existing conditions, nor those in the BAU scenario can realistically\n                  provide the level of service for meeting the basic human needs of a population;\n                  and\n          (b)     These conditions are likely to persist throughout the crediting period due to barriers\n                  such as low income, lack of capital, or inadequate infrastructure.\n8.        This standard applies to the following contexts:\n          (a)     The residential context, which may include the energy use for lighting, cooking,\n                  food preservation, communication, space heating and cooling; and safe water\n                  supply;\n          (b)     The non-residential context, which may include energy use by smallholder\n                  agriculture (e.g., milling, drying, cold storage); energy for health centres\n                  (e.g., lighting, cold storage, cooking, space heating and cooling); energy for\n                  schools (e.g., lighting, cooking, space heating and cooling, powering of teaching\n                  and learning devices);\n          (c)     Other areas, such as mobility, construction or waste management.\n9.        This standard provides specifications for the energy consumption to meet basic human\n          needs for the residential and non-residential sector but does not yet provide specifications\n          for other areas. Such specifications may be proposed in submissions of mechanism\n          methodologies. Note that the standard also does not provide values for the level of service\n          for meeting specific basic human needs in the residential and non-residential context.\n10.       This standard shall be used in conjunction with the “Standard Setting the baseline in\n          mechanism methodologies” (hereinafter referred to as the “Baseline Standard”).2 This\n          present standard specifies which provisions in the Baseline Standard do not apply to\n          suppressed demand baselines.\n11.       The standard applies to activities undertaken at the project level and may be amended in\n          the future to cover mechanism methodologies addressing mitigation actions at other\n          scales (e.g., programme-of-activities, policies, sectoral approaches).\n\n1    Stakeholders may identify the need to widen the applicability of this standard to activities involving\n     removals, by presenting specific proposals for the application of suppressed demand in removals activity\n     in new proposed mechanism methodologies.\n2    Refer A6.4-STAN-METH-004 available at https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-STAN-\n     METH-004.pdf.\n\n\n\n                                                    4 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n\n4.     General principles and requirements\n4.1.   General principles\n12.    The principles in the Baseline Standard shall apply, with an exception to the principle of\n       conservativeness which is defined as follows:\n       (a)    Conservativeness: In the context of suppressed demand, conservativeness is the\n              use of data, parameters, assumptions, and methods, to ensure that neither the\n              baseline emissions nor the level of service for meeting basic human needs are\n              overestimated.\n\n4.2.   Requirements\n13.    When addressing suppressed demand, the mechanism methodology shall:\n       (a)    Specify which basic human need(s) it addresses and the metric and threshold to\n              be used for such need(s);\n       (b)    Specify the type(s) of technology and/or practice that will provide the level of\n              service for meeting basic human needs.\n14.    The total level of service required to meet basic human needs shall be applied consistently\n       across countries, regardless of the technology and/or practice that a project activity uses\n       to address those basic human needs.\n\n5.     Approaches for recognising suppressed demand\n5.1.   Determination of the underlying conditions for recognising suppressed\n       demand\n15.    When addressing suppressed demand, the mechanism methodology shall require activity\n       participants to demonstrate that the intended project beneficiaries are in suppressed\n       demand conditions with respect to the identified basic human need(s) at the start of each\n       crediting period and that these conditions are likely to persist throughout the crediting\n       period.\n16.    Mechanism methodologies shall specify the sectors and characteristics and scale of the\n       activity types that they cover for determining a suppressed demand baseline.\n\n5.2.   Identification of the level of service for meeting basic human needs\n17.    Mechanism methodologies shall define the specific context to which the mechanism\n       methodology is applicable and the level of service for meeting basic human needs for\n       which a suppressed demand baseline may be applied to calculate baseline emissions.\n       This applies both when the technology and/or practices provided under the Article 6.4\n       activity cover one or more basic human need(s). However, the level of service for meeting\n       basic human needs shall be established separately for each basic human need.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n18.      The thresholds for the level of service for meeting basic human needs are defined as:\n         (a)     For suppressed demand in residential energy consumption, the specific basic\n                 human need values shall be derived, and appropriately justified, consistent with\n                 the following threshold values. For total energy consumption:\n                 (i)    Total electricity consumption up to 250 kWh per person per year3; and\n                 (ii)   For total useful energy delivered from fuel used for cooking and heating up\n                        to 2.1 Gigajoules (equivalent to 583 kWh) per person per year4;\n         (b)     For suppressed demand in non-residential energy consumption, deemed relevant\n                 to meet basic human needs, as described in the definition of basic human needs,\n                 the relevant specific basic human need values shall be derived, and appropriately\n                 justified, consistent with the following threshold value for total direct and indirect\n                 electricity consumption up to 750 kWh per person per year5.\n19.      The threshold for the level of service for meeting basic human needs, as outlined in\n         paragraph 18, shall be applied in general as a default approach. Proposals for alternative\n         values may be included in the mechanism methodology or tool by the methodology\n         proponents or proposed by a host Party6 for the recommendation by the MEP and approval\n         by the Supervisory Body.\n20.      Further, globally applicable values for the level of service for meeting basic human needs\n         for other areas may be developed in future revisions to this standard. These values may\n         include the identification and recognition of indirect energy demand for services required\n         to meet basic human needs in the residential or non-residential context.\n21.      Mechanism methodologies establishing suppressed demand baselines may use energy\n         metrics and non-energy metrics to determine the level of service for meeting basic human\n         needs. Where non-energy metrics are used, the metrics for the level of service for meeting\n         the basic human needs proposed by proponents of mechanism methodologies shall be\n         comparable to those in paragraphs 18(a) and 18(b) above.\n\n\n\n\n3   As defined in the Modern Energy Minimum https://modernenergyminimum.org.\n4   Adapted from the figure of 50kg-oil equivalent of modern fuel in Level 1 of energy access according to\n    The Secretary -General’s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change (AGECC), 2010, Energy for a\n    Sustainable Future: Report and Recommendations\n    https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/publications/AGECCsummaryreport.pdf.\n5   As defined in the Modern Energy Minimum https://modernenergyminimum.org.\n6   Through the proposal of a standardized baseline.\n\n\n\n                                                  6 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n22.      For establishing the level of service for meeting a specific basic human need, the following\n         data sources may be used, and it should be demonstrated all data sources are peer\n         reviewed 7:\n         (a)    National or international research8;\n         (b)    Relevant studies and reports from multilateral organizations9;\n         (c)    Established benchmarks related to international and/or national development\n                goals10.\n23.      Further, for establishing the level of service for meeting a specific basic human need, the\n         following shall be taken into account:\n         (a)    Climatic zones11;\n         (b)    Policy and regulations;\n         (c)    Scale and proportionality to the metric for the total level of service for meeting basic\n                human needs for the relevant context, as defined under paragraphs 18 and 19\n                above.\n24.      In some situations, it may be appropriate to apply two or more baseline technologies\n         and/or practices and respective service levels to reflect the cumulative project service\n         level.\n25.      The level of service for a specific basic human need shall represent a reasonable fraction\n         of the total level of service for meeting basic human needs for the relevant context, when\n         it is defined in this standard under paragraph 18 and 19 above. For example, a mechanism\n         methodology for Article 6.4 activities that provide lighting services for households shall\n         specify the limit for lighting based on a reasonable and justifiable distribution for different\n         consumption percentages of the services in the relevant geographical area.\n26.      The sum of the individual thresholds for each service shall not exceed the threshold for\n         the total level of service for meeting basic human needs for residential electric energy use,\n         considering also other electric energy services required by the household to meet its basic\n         human needs such as space cooling and heating, food preservation and communications.\n         The same would apply for an Article 6.4 activity that provides combinations of services for\n\n\n7   In case no peer-review is conducted, it should be demonstrated all data sources have gone through a\n    similar review process.\n8   For example, Table 2 of the following article can be used to estimate the proportions of specific needs\n    from the value of total Decent Living Standards. The proportions from this source may be considered by\n    methodology proponents in estimating the proportion of each specific need from the total BHN threshold:\n    J. Millward-Hopkins, J. K. Steinberger, N. D. Rao, & Y. Oswald, Providing decent living with minimum\n    energy: A global scenario, Global Environmental Change, Volume 65, 2020.\n    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102168.\n9   For example, The World Health Organization recommendations on per capita safe drinking water\n    volumes.\n10 For   example, the DLS framework, IPCC AR6 Chapter 5 Demand, Services and Social Aspects of\n    Mitigation, pages 505, 506, 513- 522:\n    https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Chapter05.pdf.\n11 As defined by the World Meteorological Organization or a host Party.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n       households; in such instances, the mechanism methodology shall specify the threshold\n       for each service separately that cumulatively meet the threshold for basic human needs.\n       For example, a mechanism methodology for Article 6.4 activities that provide both lighting\n       and cooling services for households shall specify the threshold for lighting and the\n       threshold for cooling separately.\n27.    For any service provided through the implementation of the Article 6.4 activity beyond the\n       level of service for meeting basic human needs, the following requirements shall apply:\n       (a)    For the service provided by the Article 6.4 activity up to the threshold level of\n              service for meeting basic human needs, the mechanism methodology shall require\n              the determination of a baseline scenario and a baseline technology and/or practice\n              for that service level in line with the requirements in the section 5.3 of this standard.\n              The mechanism methodology may use the suppressed demand baseline for the\n              provision of service up to the threshold for meeting basic human needs;\n       (b)    For the service provided by the Article 6.4 activity that is above the threshold level\n              of service for meeting basic human needs, the mechanism methodology shall not\n              determine a suppressed demand baseline, but a) solely use the provisions of the\n              Baseline Standard to determine the baseline, or b) provide the option to activity\n              participants that no baseline emissions for the services exceeding the threshold\n              are considered.\n28.    During the crediting period, if the baseline for the service exceeding the threshold has not\n       been determined ex-ante in the PDD of the Article 6.4 activity, and the level of service\n       provided by the Article 6.4 activity temporarily exceeds the threshold level of service for\n       meeting basic human needs, then no baseline emissions for service levels exceeding the\n       threshold level of service shall be considered.\n\n5.3.   Identification of the suppressed demand baseline technology and/or practice\n29.    Mechanism methodologies shall use the provisions in the Baseline Standard to determine\n       the baseline scenario and the baseline technology and/or practice for the suppressed\n       demand baseline, subject to the following requirements:\n       (a)    Rather than a service level that reflects existing conditions or a BAU scenario, the\n              baseline shall be determined for the lower of:\n              (i)    The level of service for meeting basic human needs; or\n              (ii)   The level of service delivered by the mitigation activity;\n       (b)    The identified baseline technology and/or practice shall be able to realistically\n              provide the level of service referred to in sub-paragraph 29(a)(i) above;\n       (c)    When applying the existing actual or historical emissions approach, the approach\n              is not required to utilize site-specific historical data but may instead use another\n              method that reflects the actual or historical emissions of the baseline technology\n              or practice;\n       (d)    The suppressed demand baseline may be based on a technology and/or practice\n              that can be demonstrated through studies, documents, or third-party records, but\n\n\n\n\n                                               8 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n               is not well documented in official records or data12, whereby the supporting\n               evidence for the baseline may not comply entirely with the Data requirements for\n               baseline setting and quantification in the Baseline Standard. The types of alternate\n               studies, documents, or third-party records permissible as evidence shall be\n               specified in the mechanism methodology;\n       (e)     The downward adjusted baseline resulting from Step 3 of the Baseline Standard\n               may be used as the crediting baseline. The determination of a conservative BAU\n               baseline, as per Step 3 and section 7 of the Baseline Standard, is not necessary\n               and the downward adjusted baseline does not need to undergo a comparison with\n               BAU or fulfil the requirement of being below BAU;\n       (f)     The downward adjustment in subsequent years, as referred to in section 7.2 of the\n               Baseline Standard, may correspond to the minimum value of 1 per cent;\n       (g)     There is no need for consideration of rebound effects, as referred to in Appendix 1\n               to the Baseline Standard.\n30.    The suppressed demand baseline shall be re-evaluated and updated at the renewal of the\n       crediting period to ensure it is based on the current situation.\n\n5.4.   Monitoring of suppressed demand conditions\n31.    Mechanism methodologies shall include requirements for activity participants to monitor\n       and reassess whether ongoing conditions continue, to indicate that suppressed demand\n       would persist in the absence of the Article 6.4 activity, using one or more indicators as\n       described in sub-paragraph 31(a) below. The mechanism methodology shall specify the\n       indicator(s) and threshold(s) to be used by activity participants to monitor and reassess\n       ongoing suppressed demand conditions, as follows:\n       (a)     Indicators may be parameters such as average household income, distance to\n               electrical substations, grid reliability, distance to water treatment plants in\n               compliance with potability standards, or others relevant for the basic human needs\n               being addressed and the conditions of the project population prior to the project\n               activity;\n       (b)     The monitoring to assess ongoing suppressed demand conditions shall exclude\n               the direct impact of the Article 6.4 activity on the conditions of the project\n               population.\n32.    The mechanism methodology shall include a provision to require activity participants to\n       undertake the reassessment of ongoing suppressed demand conditions at least every five\n       years, e.g., at the renewal of the crediting period.\n33.    If the ongoing conditions of an activity are found to exceed the threshold defined as\n       meeting suppressed demand, then that location is deemed ineligible for the baseline for\n       which suppressed demand is recognized, and a new baseline may be proposed following\n       an approved mechanism methodology via the post-registration changes procedure, as\n       referred to in the “Procedure: Article 6.4 activity cycle procedure for projects”.\n\n                                                  -----\n\n12 For example, diesel gensets in a context where these are widely used by individuals but not tracked or\n\n  reported reliably by the national government.\n\n\n\n                                                  9 of 10\nA6.4-STAN-METH-006\nStandard: Addressing suppressed demand in mechanism methodologies\nVersion 01.0\n\n\n\n                                   Document information\n\n Version    Date                  Description\n\n 01.0       7 August 2025         SBM 017, Annex 5.\n                                  Initial adoption.\n\n Decision Class: Regulatory\n Document Type: Standard\n Business Function: Methodology\n Keywords: A6.4 mechanism, suppressed demand, methodologies\n\n\n\n\n                                                10 of 10\n"

Introduction\n1.1.      Background\n1.        The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris\n          Agreement (CMA), at its third session, adopted the rules, modalities and procedures\n          (RMPs) for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement\n          (Article 6.4 mechanism)1 In the RMPs, the CMA further requested the Supervisory Body\n          to establish the requirements and processes necessary to operate the mechanism,\n          including those relating to the application of robust, social and environmental safeguards\n          to Article 6.4 activities and/or A6.4 programmes of activities (PoAs) and to develop tools\n          and approaches for assessing and reporting information about how each activity is\n          fostering sustainable development, while acknowledging that the consideration of\n          sustainable development is a national prerogative.\n2.        The RMPs also recalled the eleventh preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement,\n          “Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should,\n          when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their\n          respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of Indigenous\n          Peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in\n          vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality,\n          empowerment of women and intergenerational equity”.2\n3.        The adoption of the Article 6.4 sustainable development tool (hereinafter referred to as the\n          A6.4 SD Tool) will necessitate updates to the relevant Article 6.4 standards and\n          procedures. These updates will ensure alignment with the new A6.4 SD Tool requirements\n          for reporting, validation and verification.\n4.        The Supervisory Body of the Article 6.4 mechanism, at its fourteenth meeting (SBM 014),\n          approved the A6.4 SD Tool.\n\n1.2.      Objective\n5.        The objective of the A6.4 SD Tool is to ensure that Article 6.4 projects and/or Article 6.4\n          PoAs, collectively referred to as A6.4 activities, uphold the principle of “do no harm”, foster\n          sustainable development (SD), and contribute to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals\n          (SDGs).3\n\n\n\n\n1    Decision 3/CMA.3, annex, as contained in document FCCC/PA/CMA/2021/10/Add.1.

Scope, applicability, and entry into force\n2.1.      Scope\n6.        The A6.4 SD Tool applies to all A6.4 activities 4 including all clean development\n          mechanism (CDM) activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n          Its scope encompasses the decisions of the CMA, which outline the formal expectations\n          for the Article 6.4 mechanism, as well as the rules and requirements developed by the\n          Supervisory Body for operationalizing the mechanism.5 Specifically, the tool provides a\n          means for activity participants to demonstrate that they have met the mandatory\n          requirements for identifying and addressing social and environmental risks, as well as for\n          assessing and enhancing the contributions of A6.4 activities to SD in line with SD\n          objectives and priorities of the host Party and the SDGs.\n7.        To achieve its objective, the tool provides a structured approach for activity participants\n          to:\n            (a)     Conduct a risk assessment to identify risks and potential impacts, evaluate\n                    them, and avoid harm where possible. When avoidance is not feasible, the A6.4\n                    SD Tool instructs participants to minimize impacts as much as possible and,\n                    finally, to mitigate any remaining negative environmental and social impacts and\n                    risks by establishing activity-level environmental and social indicators;\n            (b)     Identify and assess potential positive and negative impacts on the 17\n                    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and host Party SD priorities and\n                    establish activity-level SD monitoring indicators;\n            (c)     Monitor and report the outcomes of the monitoring against the established\n                    activity-level environmental and social indicators and activity-level SD indicators.\n\n2.2.      Applicability\n8.        The use of the A6.4 SD Tool is mandatory for all proposed A6.4 activities, including all\n          CDM activities seeking eligibility for transition to the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n2.3.      Entry into force\n9.        Version 01.0 of the A.6.4 SD Tool enters into force on 9 October 2024. This document\n          shall be reviewed every 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n4     In addition to this general tool, additional safeguards criteria and guiding questions to be applied for\n     carbon dioxide removal activities and for land use, land-use change and forestry activities will be\n     developed by the Supervisory Body as new annexes to include in this SD Tool at an appropriate stage\n     in its development of regulations for activities involving removals.\n5    See Decision and documentation framework (A6.4-INFO-GOV-005) available at:\n     https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/A6.4-INFO-GOV-005.pdf.\n\n\n                                                    5 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\n3.       Article 6.4 Sustainable Development Tool\n         implementation\n3.1.     Overview of the A6.4 SD Tool\n10.      The A6.4 SD Tool requires activity participants to identify, evaluate, avoid, minimize, and\n         mitigate potential risks associated with proposed A6.4 activities.\n11.      Activity participants of A6.4 activities shall adopt mitigation strategies to avoid risks or,\n         where complete avoidance is not possible and activity implementation is nonetheless\n         permitted, minimize and mitigate identified risks.\n12.      Where complete avoidance of risk is not possible, activity participants of A6.4 activities\n         shall provide evidence, including monitoring of activity-level environmental and social\n         indicators, that the A6.4 activities comply with the environmental and social safeguarding\n         elements and criteria as defined in section 6 of this tool, including those relevant to the\n         eleventh preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement, 6 as well as relevant and\n         applicable national and international instruments to which the host Party is bound and\n         applicable legislation in the host Party (see figures 1 and 2). Such international instruments\n         may include, for example, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the\n         International Labour Organization fundamental conventions, and recognized international\n         best practices.\n13.       Activity participants are also required to:\n          (a)     Identify and assess the potential positive and negative impacts of their A6.4\n                  activities on the SD of the host Party(ies), by considering the host Party(ies)’ SD\n                  objectives and priorities, as well as the SDGs;\n          (b)     Establish activity-level SD indicators; and\n          (c)     Monitor and report the outcome against the established indicators (see figures 1\n                  and 3 and section 7.1).\n\n3.2.     Navigating the A6.4 SD Tool\n14.      The A6.4 SD Tool is divided into three key sections covering important processes, as\n         follows:\n          (a)     Section 6 Environmental and social safeguards: 7 This section focuses on\n                  elements and criteria that serve as the basis for activity participants to identify,\n                  evaluate, avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative environmental and\n                  social impacts and risks that may arise during the implementation and operation\n                  of the A6.4 activity, or CDM activity transitioning the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n                  Activity participants are required to conduct a risk assessment based on\n                  safeguards’ elements and criteria as defined under Section 6, which leads to the\n                  development of A6.4 Environmental and social management action plans.

Step 2: Establish mitigation measures (see figure 1)\n         (a)          Activity participants shall, based on the outcome of the risk assessment, develop\n                      the A6.4 Environmental and social management plan to avoid, and where\n                      complete avoidance of risk is not possible, minimize and mitigate identified\n                      potential negative impacts and risks.\n         (b)          The plan shall include proposed measures and actions to be taken by the activity\n                      participants to mitigate identified/potential negative impacts including defining\n                      and providing:\n               (i)      Actions to avoid, minimize, and mitigate potential negative environmental and\n                        social impacts and risks assessed as “Yes” or “Potentially” as per table 1 in\n                        the risk assessment process;\n               (ii)     Activity-level environmental and social indicators:28 These include monitoring\n                        parameters for tracking actions and acceptance criteria that can be tracked\n                        over activity crediting periods, along with estimates of the resources and\n                        responsibilities for implementation. These indicators shall demonstrate that\n\n\n\n\n28 A6.4 activity specific indicators identified during the risk assessment shall be defined in the completed\n\n  A6.4-FORM-AC-016. These indicators help ensure that the A6.4 activities do not cause harm - for\n  example, to the environment, communities, Indigenous Peoples, or activity workers.\n\n\n\n                                                    16 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n                      the impacts and risks do not cause harm to the environment or society and\n                      may be quantitative and/or qualitative in nature. 29\n\n6.2.    Monitoring procedure of activity-level environmental and social indicators\n25.     Activity participants shall describe, in A6.4-FORM-AC-016, the monitoring procedures for\n        activity-level environmental and social indicators relevant to mitigation strategies and\n        measures to avoid or minimize identified risks, including:\n         (a)       A description of the activity-level environmental and social indicators;\n         (b)       Data unit and source of data;\n         (c)       Information on monitoring or measurement procedures and methods;\n         (d)       Monitoring frequency (at least annual).\n26.     Based on the requirements specified in the regulations listed under Section 4: Normative\n        references, sub-paragraphs (b) through (g), once activity participants complete A6.4-\n        FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016 — reflecting inputs received or issues raised by\n        stakeholders during the local and the global stakeholder consultations — the outcome\n        (including the completed forms) must be shared with the DOE performing validation.\n27.     Once a proposed activity is registered, activity participants are required to monitor and\n        report the outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level environmental and social indicators,\n        as outlined in A6.4-FORM-AC-016, in the monitoring report. A DOE is required to verify\n        the monitoring of the indicators during each request for issuance of Article 6.4, paragraph\n        4, emission reduction (A6.4 ERs).\n\n6.3.

Human rights constitute an overarching, legally binding framework that informs and guides\n         the A6.4 activity’s implementation and consistency with all environmental and social\n         safeguards. These rights, enshrined in national laws and international instruments, such\n         as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 40 establish fundamental standards to\n         ensure dignity, equality and justice for all. Consequently, Article 6.4 supports the\n         implementation of environmental and social safeguards in order to ensure that all activities\n         are compliant with these human rights obligations. Additionally, Article 6.4 recognizes that\n         human rights are central to SD, poverty alleviation, and ensuring fair distribution of\n         development opportunities and benefits. Activity participants may not engage in any form\n         of direct or indirect, formal or informal pressure or retaliation against individuals or groups\n         who are exercising their rights in relation to an activity or proposed activity.\n\n\n38 Critical habitats are areas with high biodiversity importance, covering: (i) habitats of significant\n  importance to critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable or near-threatened species, listed as such\n  in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species; (ii) habitats\n  of significant importance to endemic and/or restricted-range species; (iii) habitats supporting globally\n  significant concentrations of migratory species and/or congregatory species; (iv) highly threatened and/or\n  unique ecosystems; (v) areas associated with key evolutionary processes; and/or (vi) legally protected\n  areas or internationally recognized areas of high biodiversity value, which may include reserves that\n  meet the criteria of the IUCN protected area management categories I through VI; World Heritage Sites;\n  areas protected under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands; core areas of world biosphere reserves; or\n  areas in the United Nations List of National Parks and Protected Areas; sites listed in the World Database\n  of Key Biodiversity Areas; or other sites meeting the criteria of the IUCN 2016 Global Standard for the\n  Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas.\n39 High Conservation Value (HCV), as defined by the HCV Network, is a biological, ecological, social, or\n\n  cultural   value   of   outstanding   significance        or   critical   importance.

E8.4: Activity participants of the A6.4 activity are to conduct a census and a socioeconomic\n        baseline survey to identify all affected individuals, groups or communities that will be\n        physically or economically displaced. A resettlement and/or livelihood action plans are to\n        be integrated into A6.4-FORM-AC-016 (see figure 1) where physical displacement is\n        involved. The action plan will be developed in accordance with international best practices\n        (e.g. United Nations Development Programme Standard 5: Displacement and\n        Resettlement 48), in full consultation with the affected individuals, groups or communities\n        and based on good-faith negotiations. Resettlement understandings reached by the\n        activity participants with affected individuals, groups or communities are to be reflected in\n        written agreements.\n\n\n\n\n46 Involuntary resettlement refers to a scenario when affected persons or communities do not have the right\n\n  to refuse land acquisition or restrictions on land use that result in displacement.\n47 FPIC is a specific right of Indigenous Peoples recognized in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights\n\n  of Indigenous Peoples.

Activity participants shall provide justification for any\n                  excluded SDGs, considering the SD objectives and priorities of the host Party,\n                  including those described above and the criteria defined in paragraph 95(c) below\n                  (see figures 1 and 3);\n         (c)      Impacts on the SDGs and their goals shall:\n\n55 Cultural heritage is preserved, protected, and promoted in mitigation activities in a manner consistent\n\n  with UNESCO Cultural Heritage conventions or any other national or international legal instruments that\n  might have a bearing on the use of cultural heritage.\n56 Direct impact: an impact based on direct contribution or interaction by an activity with an environmental,\n\n  social, or economic component during the implementation and operation, and if applicable dismantling.\n57 The latest “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030\n\n  Agenda for Sustainable Development” is available at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-\n  list/ in six official languages of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n                                                  27 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n               (i)       Be relevant to the A6.4 activity type;\n               (ii)      Result in a direct impact (i.e., the A6.4 activity is the main driver of change);\n               (iii)     Be recurring/lasting during the crediting period of the A6.4 activity and impact\n                         the stakeholders and/or local environment in a direct and measurable way;\n         (d)          Once activity participants identify SDGs impacted by the A6.4 activity, they are\n                      required to:\n               (i)       Review the respective targets defined under the identified SDGs from the\n                         latest “Global indicator framework for the Sustainable Development Goals and\n                         targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”;\n               (ii)      Select target(s) under the SDGs based on the criteria defined in the paragraph\n                         95(c) above;\n               (iii)     Review indicators defined under the selected target(s) within the identified\n                         SDGs and select relevant indicator(s). Since these indicators are defined at\n                         regional and national levels, activity participants shall develop their own\n                         activity-level SD indicators, as per step 3 below.\n92.     Step 3: Establish A6.4 activity-level SD indicators (see figures 1 and 3)\n         (a)          Activity participants shall establish A6.4 activity-level SD indicators for each\n                      identified direct impact to the SDG resulting from the activity, taking into\n                      consideration the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators. All relevant SDG\n                      targets and corresponding indicators for each SDG should be chosen (see figures\n                      1 and 3, and table 3 below);\n         (b)          When activity participants identify negative impacts on any of the 17 SDGs, they\n                      should refer to the outcomes of the risk assessment (see Section 6 above, Steps\n                      1 and 2);\n         (c)          If the identified negative impacts on the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators\n                      are already considered in A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016, activity\n                      participants do not need to establish relevant activity-level SD indicator(s);\n         (d)          If the identified negative impacts on the SDG, SDG targets and SDG indicators\n                      are not already considered in A6.4-FORM-AC-015 and A6.4-FORM-AC-016,\n                      activity participants are required to establish relevant activity-level SD indicator(s)\n                      to minimize and mitigate the identified negative impacts. Where complete\n                      avoidance of identified negative impact is not possible, activity participants shall\n                      provide evidence, including monitoring of activity-level SD indicators, that the\n                      A6.4 activities align with host Party legislation.\n93.     A6.4 Activity-level SD indicator(s) can be qualitative or quantitative and shall be\n        monitorable over the crediting period. The A6.4 activity-level SD indicator(s) shall:\n        (a)      Be in line with the objectives and intent of the SDGs and their corresponding\n                 targets;\n        (b)      Be directly impacted by the activity; 58\n\n58      See footnote 56.\n\n\n\n                                                    28 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n        (c)     Not be a one-off occurrence;\n        (d)     Include the monitoring approach and parameters, including the frequency of\n                monitoring, to be used for each selected activity-level SDG target indicator defined\n                in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017.\n\n        Table 3.

Monitoring procedures for A6.4 activity-level SD indicators\n94.     Activity participants shall describe in the A6.4-FORM-AC-017 the monitoring procedures\n        of A6.4 activity-level SD indicators, including:\n         (a)         The A6.4 activity-level SD indicators, including selected SDGs, SDG targets and\n                     SDG indicators;\n         (b)         Data unit and source of data;\n         (c)         Information on monitoring/measurement procedures/methods;\n         (d)         Monitoring frequency (at least annual).\n95.     Based on the requirements specified in the regulations listed under Section 4: Normative\n        references, sub-paragraphs (b) through (g), once activity participants complete the A6.4-\n        FORM-AC-017 reflecting inputs received or issues raised by stakeholders during local and\n        global stakeholder consultations, the outcome (including the form) must be shared with\n        the DOE performing validation.\n96.     Once the A6.4 activity is registered, activity participants shall monitor and report the\n        outcome of monitoring A6.4 activity-level SD indicators in the monitoring report, as per the\n        A6.4-FORM-AC-017. A DOE is required to verify the monitoring of the indicators during\n        each request for issuance of A6.4 ERs.\n\n8.      Validation\n97.     The requirements for validation of A6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4 validation\n        and verification standards for projects and PoAs.59\n98.     The DOE shall validate the appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of the information\n        provided in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016, and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as\n        reported in the project design document by:\n         (a)         Step1: reviewing stakeholder consultation documents [inputs/comments];\n         (b)         Step 2: conducting interviews with local stakeholders;\n         (c)         Step 3: reviewing relevant host party documentation;\n         (d)         Step 4: providing a validation opinion employing professional judgement and as\n                     per A6.4 validation and verification standard for projects and PoAs.\n99.     The DOE shall validate:\n         (a)         Both quantitative and qualitative information provided, to assess the adequacy of\n                     the identification of environmental and/or social risks caused by the A6.4 activity.\n                     The validation should be done by taking the four steps referred to in paragraph\n                     97 above, in order to:\n               (i)      Validate the risk assessment and risk mitigation plan presented in A6.4-\n                        FORM-AC-015, as per the provision referred to in paragraph 12;\n\n\n\n59 See Section 4: Normative references.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  31 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n                  (ii)     Validate that the activity-level environmental and social indicators defined in\n                           the A6.4 environmental and social safeguards risk assessment ensure that the\n                           A6.4 activities do not cause harm, to the environment and stakeholders.\n            (b)          That the outcome of A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-016, and A6.4-\n                         FORM-AC-017 have been shared during the local stakeholder consultation and\n                         that inputs received from the consultation are reflected in the completed form;\n            (c)          That there is an established continuous engagement of local stakeholders in\n                         accordance with the AS-P or the AS-PoA;60\n            (d)          The appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of the information provided in\n                         the A6.4-FORM-AC-017 by taking the four steps referred to in paragraph 97\n                         above in order to:\n                  (i)      Validate that the SD objectives and/or criteria of the host Party documented in\n                           A6.4-FORM-AC-017 are in line with the host Party’s definition (when\n                           available);\n                  (ii)     Validate that the A6.4 activity-level SD indicators defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-\n                           017 are universally applicable to the activity type and significant,\n                           recurring/lasting for at least the entire crediting period of the A6.4 activity, and\n                           impacting the primary stakeholders and/or local environment in a direct and\n                           measurable way, resulting in a primary benefit;\n                  (iii)    Validate that the description of A6.4 activity-level SD indicators is accurately\n                           reflected in A6.4-FORM-AC-017.\n100.       The DOE shall provide a validation opinion stating that, based on A6.4-FORM-AC-016\n           and A6.4-FORM-AC-017, the A6.4 activity results in no harm and contributes to SD.\n101.       If the DOE identifies the presence of unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the\n           environmental and social safeguards elements and criteria and cannot be remediated by\n           consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative validation opinion as per the\n           A6.4 validation and verification standard61 or submit a deviation request to the Supervisory\n           Body prior to submitting a request for registration. Box 1 below contains a best practice\n           example of validation.\n\n\n\n\n60 Ibid.\n\n61 See paragraph 64 of VVS-P and paragraph 160 of VVS-PoA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      32 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n           Box 1.       Best practice example of validation\n\n             A proposed activity is to distribute energy-efficient appliances to households in coastal\n             and peninsular areas. An activity participant identifies that their activity contributes to\n             SDG 1462 and SDG 1563 based on the location of the proposed activity, which is near to\n             the marine and forest ecosystem. During the validation, the DOE raises a corrective action\n             request (CAR) asking the activity participants to clarify how the proposed activity’s\n             impact on SDG 14 and SDG 15 is direct and primary, as per section 7.1 of the applied tool.\n             The activity participants acknowledge that their activity does not directly contribute to\n             SDG 14 and SDG 15 and excludes these contributions to SDG 14 and SDG 15 from A6.4-\n             FORM-AC-017. Based on this revision, the DOE closes its CAR accordingly.\n\n\n9.         Verification\n102.       The requirements relating to the verification for A 6.4 activities are set out in the Article 6.4\n           validation and verification standards for projects and PoAs.64. The DOE shall verify the\n           appropriateness, relevance, and sufficiency of information provided in the monitoring of\n           the environmental and social indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4 activity-level SD\n           indicators in A6.4-FORM-AC-017 as reported in a monitoring report.\n103.       If the DOE observes any deviation from the information in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-\n           FORM-AC-017 that were validated at the registration, it will provide its verification opinion\n           on the observed deviation, indicating whether the A6.4 activity is still within the social and\n           environmental impact and/or SD impact defined in A6.4-FORM-AC-015, A6.4-FORM-AC-\n           016 and the A6.4 Sustainable development impact form.\n104.       The DOE shall review any input and comments received via continuous engagement of\n           local stakeholders in accordance with the AS-P or AS-PoA,65 conduct interviews with local\n           stakeholders, and employ professional judgement in the evaluation of the ex-post\n           fulfilment of risk assessment and SD impacts due to the activity.\n105.       The DOE shall confirm that the activity participants have measured, monitored, and\n           reported parameters established in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017\n           submitted at the registration stage.\n106.       If the DOE identifies unavoidable negative impacts that exceed the parameters\n           established in A6.4-FORM-AC-016 and A6.4-FORM-AC-017 and cannot be remediated\n           by consultation or mitigation, the DOE shall issue a negative verification opinion as per\n           the A6.4 validation and verification standard or submit a deviation request to the\n           Supervisory Body prior to submitting a request for issuance. Box 2 below contains a best\n           practice example of verification.\n\n\n\n62 SDG 14 (life below water) is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources\n\n   for sustainable development. (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14)\n63 SDG   15 (life on land) is protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,\n   sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt\n   biodiversity loss (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15).\n64 See Section 4: Normative references.\n\n65 Ibid.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   33 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n        Box 2.        Best practice example of verification\n\n          Activity participants identify the A6.4 activity’s contribution to SDG 866 based on jobs\n          generated from the proposed activity and include the number of generated jobs in A6.4-\n          FORM-AC-017 as a monitoring indicator. During the verification of the number of jobs\n          generated under SDG 8, a DOE identifies that the number includes short-term\n          construction phase jobs and raises a CAR asking activity participants to clarify how the\n          inclusion of short-term construction phase jobs aligns with section 7.1 of the applied tool,\n          which requires SD impact to be significant and recurring/lasting for at least the entire\n          crediting period of the activity. The activity participants acknowledge that the inclusion\n          of short-term construction phase jobs is not in line with the SD impact defined in section\n          7.1 of the applied tool, and the DOE closes the CAR by verifying a revised number that\n          does not include short-term construction phase jobs.\n\n\n\n\n66 SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) is to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic\n\n  growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (See https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8).\n\n\n\n                                                 34 of 59\nA6.4-TOOL-AC-001\nTool: Article 6.4 sustainable development tool\nVersion 01.1\n\n\n\n\nGuiding            questions for the risk assessment of the\n                      environmental and social safeguards elements\n                      and criteria\n\nInstruction\n1.

The CMA is recommended to take note of this report and consider the\n         recommendations contained herein, as appropriate.\n\n\nD.       Recommendations for the Conference of the Parties serving as the\n         meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement\n\n         6.     The Supervisory Body recommends that the CMA:\n                (a)     Note the progress of work of the Supervisory Body with regard to the mandates\n         in decisions 3/CMA.3 and 7/CMA.4 (see section II.A below);\n                (b)   Agree to exempt activities under Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement\n         in the LDCs from the share of proceeds from adaptation, while recognizing that the LDCs\n         may choose not to use this exemption (see section II.A below);\n                (c)    Request the Supervisory Body to establish a Designated National Authorities\n         Forum on the Article 6.4 mechanism to facilitate the exchange of information and experience\n         among designated national authorities and the identification of common challenges at the\n         regional and subregional level in operationalizing the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n     1   See decision 3/CMA.3, annex.\n     2   https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-64-mechanism.\n\n\n                                                                                                               3\nFCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15\n\n\n     II. Work in the reporting period\n\n      A.       Mandates from the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of\n               the Parties to the Paris Agreement\n\n               7.    To provide an overview of the issues to be considered by the Supervisory Body at\n               each meeting and to identify and plan specific activities arising from the mandates from the\n               CMA, the Body develops annual workplans. The workplan for 2023 3 was approved at\n               SB 004.\n               8.     In the reporting period, the Supervisory Body focused on responding to the mandates\n               that are to be delivered on by the time of CMA 5. Paragraphs 16–17 below provide\n               information on the progress of the work conducted in response to those immediate mandates.\n               The remainder of this subsection addresses the progress of work arising from the other\n               mandates in decision 7/CMA.4 as well as in decision 3/CMA.3.\n\n      1.       Activities involving removals\n               9.     Following the request of the CMA in decision 7/CMA.4, paragraphs 19–20, the\n               Supervisory Body considered the 289 inputs from Parties, observers and other stakeholders\n               received through the structured public consultation process and work done by Supervisory\n               Body members in an informal working group to elaborate and further develop\n               recommendations on activities involving removals, on the basis of the RMPs. The\n               Supervisory Body will continue to consider this matter at its 8th meeting and report on\n               progress in the addendum to this report.\n\n      2.       Application of the methodology requirements\n               10.     Following the requests of the CMA in decision 7/CMA.4, paragraphs 21–22, the\n               Supervisory Body considered the 34 inputs received from stakeholders through the structured\n               public consultation process and work done by Supervisory Body members in an informal\n               working group to elaborate and further develop the recommendation on the application of the\n               requirements referred to in chapter V.B (Methodologies) of the RMPs. The Supervisory Body\n               will continue to consider this matter at its 8th meeting and report on progress in the addendum\n               to this report.\n\n      3.       Transition of clean development mechanism activities\n               11.     Significant progress was made regarding the transition of CDM activities to the\n               Article 6.4 mechanism. In response to the request of the CMA in decision 7/CMA.4,\n               paragraph 23(a), the Supervisory Body agreed to begin receiving requests for the transition\n               of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism from their project participants starting on\n               30 June 2023. Additionally, the Supervisory Body adopted the standard 4 and procedure5 for\n               the transition process and agreed to make them effective from 1 January 2024, subject to the\n               availability of detailed regulatory elements to enable the operationalization of the transition\n               process. These elements are to be developed by the Supervisory Body.\n\n      4.       Development of regulations and processes for implementing the mechanism\n               established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement\n               12.    The work on regulatory documents related to projects continued to progress during\n               the reporting period. Following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a),\n               the Supervisory Body considered the activity standard, validation and verification standard,\n\n           3 See Supervisory Body document A6.4-SB004-A01, available at https://unfccc.int/process-and-\n             meetings/bodies/constituted-bodies/article-64-supervisory-body/meetings-of-the-article-64-\n             supervisory-body.\n           4 Standard for the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism is available at\n\n             https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb006-a01.pdf.\n           5 Procedure for the transition of CDM activities to the Article 6.4 mechanism is available at\n\n             https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb006-a02.pdf.\n\n\n4\n                                                                                                  FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15\n\n\n         and activity cycle procedure for projects and agreed to conduct a focused and inclusive\n         stakeholder interaction thereon. On the basis of the draft activity cycle procedure, the\n         development of information technology infrastructure needed to support the activity cycle\n         procedure will begin. In this regard, the Supervisory Body has also started to work on the\n         appeal and grievance processes under the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Supervisory Body will\n         consider a first draft of the appeal and grievance procedure at its 8th meeting with a view to\n         seeking input from stakeholders thereafter.\n         13.     Also, following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(a), as well\n         as the provisions in paragraph 35 of the RMPs, the Supervisory Body adopted the following\n         procedures: “Development, revision and clarification of methodologies and methodological\n         tools” and “Development, revision, clarification and update of standardized baselines”. The\n         arrangements necessary for operationalizing these procedures are being prepared with the\n         aim of operationalizing them during the first quarter of 2024.\n         14.   To fulfil the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(b), the\n         Supervisory Body has initiated work on reviewing the baseline and monitoring\n         methodologies in use for the CDM with a view to applying them with revisions, as\n         appropriate, for the activities under the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n         15.     Regarding the sustainable development tool, the Supervisory Body decided that using\n         such a tool is mandatory in the Article 6.4 mechanism. Following the request of the CMA in\n         decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(c), the Supervisory Body has been reviewing the sustainable\n         development tool in use for the CDM and other tools and safeguard systems in use for\n         existing market-based mechanisms to promote sustainable development with a view to\n         developing a similar tool for the Article 6.4 mechanism. The Supervisory Body will consider\n         a first draft of the tool at its 8th meeting with a view to seeking input from stakeholders\n         thereafter.\n         16.    Following the requests of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(d) and (e), the\n         Supervisory Body has been reviewing the accreditation standards and procedures of the CDM\n         with a view to applying them with revisions, as appropriate, for the Article 6.4 mechanism\n         by the end of 2023 and to approve the standard and procedure to be able to expeditiously\n         accredit operational entities as designated operational entities. The Supervisory Body will\n         continue to consider this matter at its 8th meeting.\n         17.     Once the accreditation standards and procedures are approved, the Supervisory Body\n         aims for the transition of CDM designated operational entities to the Article 6.4 mechanism\n         (at least for verification of transition activities) to occur by the second quarter of 2024,\n         following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, annex, paragraph 24(b).\n\n5.       Capacity-building programme\n         18.    Progress has been made regarding designing and implementing the capacity-building\n         programme aimed at assisting Parties wishing to voluntarily participate in the Article 6.4\n         mechanism. Following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 14, the\n         secretariat, in consultation with the Supervisory Body, has designed and started to implement\n         a five-year capacity-building work programme through the secretariat’s regional\n         collaboration centres.6\n\n6.       Registry for the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris\n         Agreement\n         19.     In accordance with the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, annex, paragraphs\n         55, 58−61 and 63−65, the Supervisory Body considered the modalities for operation of the\n         Article 6.4 mechanism registry and will continue to consider the functional aspects and issues\n         that require a decision by the Supervisory Body. Work on developing the requirements for\n\n\n\n     6   The report on the progress of implementation of the capacity-building programme is contained in\n         Supervisory Body document A6.4-SB005-AA-A11, available at\n         https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb005-aa-a11.pdf.\n\n\n                                                                                                                    5\nFCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15\n\n\n           the mechanism registry has advanced and will continue to advance in parallel. The\n           procurement process for the registry software was launched during the reporting period.\n\n      7.   Other considerations by the Supervisory Body\n           20.    Following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(f), the\n           Supervisory Body ensured that the special circumstances of the LDCs and small island\n           developing States may be recognized in further decisions of the CMA relating to the RMPs.\n           The Supervisory Body agreed to recommend to the CMA that it exempt activities under\n           Article 6, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement in the LDCs from the share of proceeds for\n           adaptation, while recognizing that the LDCs may choose not to use this exemption.\n           21.    The Supervisory Body agreed to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the inclusion of\n           provisions in methodologies under development that specifically address small and micro\n           businesses scale activities as a means of supporting these businesses in the development of\n           methodologies, inter alia, for simplified additionality, baselines, monitoring, calculations,\n           and validation and verification, following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3,\n           paragraph 5(g).\n           22.     The Supervisory Body also considered matters related to Indigenous Peoples and local\n           communities in its work and in the operations of the Article 6.4 mechanism. Following the\n           request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(h), the Supervisory Body considered\n           opportunities to engage with the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform and\n           its Facilitative Working Group.\n           23.   Following the request of the CMA in decision 3/CMA.3, paragraph 5(i), the\n           Supervisory Body considered the gender action plan and incorporating relevant actions into\n           the work of the Supervisory Body and the operations of the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n           24.    In accordance with paragraph 21 of the RMPs, the Supervisory Body agreed on a\n           decision-making and documentation framework.\n\n\n      B.   Communications and outreach\n\n           25.  The Supervisory Body continued to emphasize the importance of strategic\n           communications in implementing the Article 6.4 mechanism.\n\n\n    III.   Governance and management\n           26.     The Supervisory Body applied its rules of procedure after their adoption at CMA 4.\n           In this regard, members and alternate members of the Supervisory Body signed their oath of\n           service, made their curriculum vitae publicly available and provided statements of conflict\n           of interest for each meeting.\n           27.    The first members and alternate members of the Supervisory Body were elected at\n           CMA 3. As this was the initial election, half of the members and their alternate members\n           were elected for a term of three years and the other half for a term of two years. In this regard,\n           the term of 12 members and alternate members will come to an end at the first meeting in\n           2024, and they will be replaced by members and alternate members elected at CMA 5.\n           28.

The Supervisory Body agreed to keep this practice\n               under review.\n               35.   Observers continued to show considerable interest in the meetings of the Supervisory\n               Body. On average, 25 observers per meeting were registered. A list of registered observers\n               is made publicly available as part of the documentation for each meeting.\n               36.    The Supervisory Body considered public inputs received on matters on the agenda for\n               its meetings held during the reporting period. In addition to considering these inputs, the\n               Supervisory Body opened calls for inputs from stakeholders on specific topics or issues,\n               which helped the Body in its considerations.9 The Supervisory Body received more than\n               300 inputs on various topics during the reporting period.\n               37.    At its 4th meeting, the Supervisory Body adopted a procedure entitled “Procedure:\n               Consideration of unsolicited letters to the Supervisory Body” that sets out the modalities by\n               which the Body considers and processes unsolicited letters sent by stakeholders.\n               38.    Further, with a view to enhancing the engagement and interaction of stakeholders, the\n               Supervisory Body held two webinars prior to its 6th meeting, which were highly attended by\n               a broad range of stakeholders.\n               39.     On 9 November 2022, the Supervisory Body held a side event entitled “Transparency\n               and expectations from our Stakeholders” on the margins of the twenty-seventh session of the\n               Conference of the Parties.10 In addition, on 10 June 2023, the Supervisory Body held the side\n               event entitled “Status of implementation of the Article 6.4 mechanism” on the margins of the\n               fifty-eighth sessions of the subsidiary bodies. Preparations are under way for a side event to\n               be held at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties.11\n\n\n      B.       Financial status of the mechanism established by Article 6,\n               paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement\n\n               40.     To streamline its financial arrangements and expedite the implementation of the\n               Article 6.4 mechanism, the Supervisory Body agreed on a two-year business and resource\n               allocation plan. This plan outlines the strategic vision and goals for 2024–2025, expected\n               activities to operationalize the mechanism and the related resources required.\n               41.    During the reporting period, the Supervisory Body did not engage in any income-\n               generating activities.

Table 4 displays the expected balance on 31 December 2023. The projected 2023\n               expenses of USD 3.4 million will be fully met from the existing balance. Yet, the year-end\n               projected balance will not be sufficient to cover the estimated resource needs for 2024–2025.\n\n           9  See https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article-64-mechanism/calls-for-\n              input.\n           10 https://seors.unfccc.int/seors/reports/archive.html.\n           11 See paragraph 41 of the 7th meeting report, available at\n\n              https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/a64-sb007_0.pdf.\n8\n                                                                                    FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/15\n\n\nThe Supervisory Body invites the CMA to assist in fundraising and to request the Conference\nof the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol for additional fund\nallocations from the Trust Fund for the Clean Development Mechanism, tapping into any\navailable surpluses.\nTable 4\nProjected balance as of 31 December 2023\n\n                                                   2022                                  2023\nItem                                    (amount in USD)                       (amount in USD)\n\nCarry-over from                            30 000 000                            29 569 386\nprevious year\nAdd: income                                          –                                     –\nLess: expenses                                430 614                            3 400 000a\nTotal: previous                            29 569 386                            26 169 386\nyear’s carry-\nover plus\nincome and less\nexpenses\n a     Projected.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                      9\n"
